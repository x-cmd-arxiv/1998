variety of systems such as stock markets and city populations. These systems
are characterized by a large number of interacting objects and the dynamics is
dominated by multiplicative processes. The instantaneous probability
distribution $P(w,t)$ of the system components $w_i$, turns out to fulfill a
(truncated) Pareto power-law $P(w,t) \sim w^{-1-\alpha}$. The time evolution of
${\bar w (t)} $ presents intermittent fluctuations parametrized by a truncated
L\'evy distribution of index $\alpha$, showing a connection between the
distribution of the $w_i$'s at a given time and the temporal fluctuations of
their average.

binding energy varies as expected from $1 Ry$ at large widths to $4 Ry$ at
small widths. For a finite potential, but without consideration of a mass
mismatch or a dielectric mismatch, we substantiate earlier results that the
binding energy approaches the value $1 Ry$ for both small and large widths,
having a characteristic peak for some intermediate size of the slab. Taking the
mismatch into account, this result will in general no longer be true. For the

  Microscopic Analysis","47 pages, 15 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.58.12282",,"cond-mat",,"  We calculate microscopically the properties of the dilute He-3 component in a
He-3/--He-4 mixture. These depend on both, the dominant interaction between the
impurity atom and the background, and the Fermi liquid contribution due to the
interaction between the constituents of the He-3 component. We first calculate
the dynamic structure function of a He-3 impurity atom moving in He-3. From
that we obtain the excitation spectrum and the momentum dependent effective
mass. The pole strength of this excitation mode is strongly reduced from the
free particle value in agreement with experiments; part of the strength is
distributed over high frequency excitations. Above k > 1.7$\AA$^{-1}$ the
motion of the impurity is damped due to the decay into a roton and a low energy
impurity mode. Next we determine the Fermi--Liquid interaction between He-4
atoms and calculate the pressure-- and concentration dependence of the
effective mass, magnetic susceptibility, and the He-3--He-3 scattering phase
shifts. The calculations are based on a dynamic theory that uses, as input,
effective interactions provided by the Fermi hypernetted--chain theory. The
relationship between both theories is discussed. Our theoretical effective
masses agree well with recent measurements by Yorozu et al. (Phys. Rev. B 48,
9660 (1993)) as well as those by R. Simons and R. M. Mueller (Czekoslowak
Journal of Physics Suppl. 46, 201 (1996)), but our analysis suggests a new
extrapolation to the zero-concentration limit. With that effective mass we also
find a good agreement with the measured Landau parameter F_0^a.

potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. Its evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\""odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  The present first part of this investigation is devoted to the introduction
of basic concepts on which the fibre bundle approach to quantum mechanics
rests. We show that the evolution of pure quantum-mechanical states can be
described as a suitable linear transport along paths, called evolution
transport, of the state sections in the Hilbert fibre bundle of states of a
