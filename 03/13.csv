galaxy space distribution. First, recent analyses have revealed that the three
dimensional distribution of galaxies and clusters is characterized by large
scale structures and huge voids: such a distribution shows fractal correlations
up to the limits of the available samples. This has confirmed the earlier de
Vaucouleurs power-law density - distance relation, now corresponding to a
fractal structure with dimension $D \approx 2$, at least, in the range of
scales $ \sim 1 \div 200 Mpc$ ($H_0 = 55 km/sec/Mpc$). An eventual cut-off
towards homogenization has not been yet identified. Second, since Hubble's
discovery, the linear redshift-distance law has been well established within
$200 Mpc$ and also much deeper. The co-existence of these laws within the same
scales is a challenge for the standard cosmology where the linear Hubble law is
a strict consequence of homogeneity of the expanding universe. This puzzle is
now sufficiently strong to raise doubts for the standard cosmology.

based on the use of the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations of the point
distribution defined by the locations at which the velocity field is sampled.
Adjusting themselves automatically to the density of sampling points, they
represent the optimal estimator for volume-averaged quantities. They are
therefore particularly suited for checking the validity of the predictions of
quasi-linear analytical density and velocity field perturbation theory through
the results of N-body simulations of structure formation. We illustrate the
subsequent succesfull application of the two methods to estimate the
bias-independent value of $\Omega$ in the N-body simulations on the basis of
the predictions of perturbation theory for the $\Omega$-dependence of the
moments and PDF of the velocity divergence in gravitational instability
structure formation scenarios with Gaussian initial conditions. We will also
shortly discuss practical and complicating issues involved in the obvious
extension of the Voronoi and Delaunay method to the analysis of observational

survey. At faint magnitudes, the slope of the differential number-magnitude
relation is flatter than 0.2 in all four HDF bandpasses. In the ultraviolet, a
fluctuation analysis shows that the flattening observed below U=26 mag is not
due to incompleteness and is more pronounced than in the other bands,
consistent with the idea that a redshift limit has been reached in the galaxy
distribution. A reddening trend of about 0.5 magnitude is observed at faint
fluxes in the colour-magnitude diagram, (U-V)_{eff} vs. V. We interpret these
results as the effect of intergalactic attenuation on distant galaxies. At flux
levels of AB=27 mag and in agreement with the fluctuation analysis and the
colour-magnitude relation, about 7% of the sources in U, 30% in B and 35% in V
are Lyman-break ``dropouts'', i.e. candidate star-forming galaxies at z>2. By
integrating the number counts to the limits of the HDF survey we find that the
mean surface brightness of the extragalactic sky is dominated by galaxies that
are relatively bright and are known to have <z>=0.6. To AB=29 mag, the
integrated light from resolved galaxies in the I-band is 2.1\pm 0.4 \times

outburst using HST, XTE and GRO and AAT. This outburst was qualitatively quite
different to other SXT outbursts and to previous outbursts of this source. The
onset of hard X-ray activity occurred very slowly, over several months and was
delayed relative to the soft X-ray rise. During this period, the optical fluxes
declined steadily. This apparent anti-correlation is not consistent with the
standard disc instability model of SXT outbursts, nor is it expected if the
optical output is dominated by reprocessing. Using our derived reddening we
find that our dereddened spectra are dominated by a component peaking in the
optical with the expected nu^1/3 disc spectrum seen only in the UV. We consider
possible interpretations of this spectrum in terms of thermal emission from the
outer accretion disc and/or secondary star, both with and without X-ray
irradiation, and also as non-thermal optical synchrotron emission from a
compact self-absorbed central source. The X-ray spectra broadly resemble the
high-soft state commonly seen in black hole candidates, but evolve through two
substates. The outburst dataset cannot readily be interpreted by any standard
model for SXT outbursts. Many of the characteristics could be interpreted with
a model combining X-ray irradiation with the disc instability, but with the
added ingredient of a very large disc in this long period system.

~1.0 between log e(B[LTE]) and [Fe/H] found for 10 halo and disk stars by
Duncan et al. 1997. Using the NLTE correction of Kiselman and Carlsson (1996),

This comparison is performed using the local luminosity functions at UV and FIR
wavelengths and on individual starburst galaxies for which photometric data
from UV to NIR and FIR are available. The comparison of the FIR and UV local
luminosity functions argues for a moderate extinction in nearby disk galaxies.
For a sample of 22 starburst galaxies, it is found that the UV(912-3650AA), the
visible(3600-12500 AA) and the NIR(12500-22000 AA) wavelength range contribute
30%, 50% and 20% respectively to the total emerging stellar emission. The mean
ratio of the dust to bolometric luminosity of these galaxies is 0.37+/-0.22
similar to the ratio found for normal spiral galaxies. The mean extinction at
2000AA is found to be ~1.2mag although with a large dispersion. The conversion
factor of the stellar emission into dust emission is found to correlate with
the luminosity of the galaxies, brighter galaxies having a higher conversion
factor. We conclude that a very large conversion of the stellar light into dust
emission can no longer be assumed as a general property of starburst galaxies
at least in the local Universe. We compare the UV properties of our local
starburst galaxies to those of high redshift galaxies. The larger extinction
found in the distant galaxies is consistent with the trend we find for the
nearby starburst galaxies namely the brighter the galaxies the lower the escape
fraction of stellar light.

Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. Chaotic dynamics provides the mixing property in
phase space necessary for obtaining equilibration; however, the relaxation time
to equilibrium grows with $N$, at least near the critical point. Our results
constitute an interesting bridge between Hamiltonian chaos in many degrees of
freedom systems and equilibrium thermodynamics.

domain walls form a Bloch band of delocalized quantum states while a static
field applied along the easy axis localizes them into Wannier wave packets and
causes them to execute Bloch oscillations, i.e. the domain walls oscillate
along the chain with a finite Bloch frequency and amplitude. In the presence of
the field, the Bloch band, with a continuum of extended states, breaks up into
the Wannier-Zeeman ladder -- a discrete set of equally spaced energy levels. We
calculate the dynamical structure factor in the one-soliton sector at finite

inflation, is discussed. This phase is modeled by a closed
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry, the matter content of which is radiation
plus a scalar field minimally coupled to the gravitational field. The simple
configuration, with two effective degres of freedom only, presents a very
complicated dynamics connected to the existence of critical points of
saddle-center type and saddle type in phase space of the system. Each of these
critical points is associated to an extremum of the scalar field potential. The
Topology of the phase space about the saddle-center is characterized by
homoclinic cylinders emanating from unstable periodic orbits, and the
transversal crossing of the cylinders, due to the non-integrability of the
system, results in a chaotic dynamics. The topology of the homoclinic cylinders
provides an invariant characterization of chaos. The model exhibits one or more
exits to inflation, associated to one or more strong asymptotic de Sitter
attractors present in phase space, but the way out from the initial singularity
into any of the inflationary exits is chaotic. We discuss possible mechanisms,
connected to the spectrum of inhomogeneous fluctuations in the models, which
would allow us to distinguish physically the several exits to inflation.

an instanton, or Euclidean solution of the field equations, which interpolates
between the initial and final states. In practice, however, it has become
customary to calculate such amplitudes using the No-Boundary Proposal of Hartle
and Hawking. A criticism of this method is that it does not use a single path
which interpolates between the initial and final states, but two disjoint
instantons: One divides the probability to create the final state from nothing
by the probability to create the initial state from nothing and decrees the
answer to be the rate of tunneling from the initial to the final state. Here,
we demonstrate the validity of this approach by constructing continuous paths
connecting the ingoing and outgoing data, which may be viewed as perturbations
of the set of disconnected instantons. They are off-shell, but will still
dominate the path integral as they have action arbitrarily close to the
no-boundary action. In this picture, a virtual domain wall, or wormhole, is
created and annihilated in such a way as to interface between the disjoint
instantons. Decay rates calculated using our construction differ from decay
rates calculated using the No-Boundary Proposal only in the prefactor; the
exponent, which usually dominates the result, remains unchanged.

required for such studies with the (quenched) Wilson gauge action, namely, the
determination of the renormalized anisotropy $\xi$ as a function of the bare
anisotropy $\xi_0$ and the coupling. By, essentially, comparing the
finite-volume heavy quark potential where the quarks are separated along a
spatial direction with that where they are separated along the time direction,
we determine the relation between $\xi$ and $\xi_0$ to a fraction of 1% for
weak and to 1% for strong coupling. We present a simple parameterization of
this relation for $1\leq \xi \leq 6$ and $5.5 \leq \beta \leq \infty$, which
incorporates the known one-loop result and reproduces our non-perturbative
determinations within errors. Besides solving the problem of how to choose the
bare anisotropies if one wants to take the continuum limit at fixed
renormalized anisotropy, this parameterization also yields accurate estimates
of the derivative $\partial\xi_0/\partial\xi$ needed in thermodynamic studies.

couplings unification in the MSSM and its SU(5) extensions are studied in
detail. In the framework of the two-loop renormalization group equations both
low- and high-energy threshold effects are included. In the case of the minimal
SU(5), the values of \alpha_s obtained are somewhat larger than the
experimental average. The Peccei-Quinn version of the missing-doublet SU(5)
model generally predicts smaller values of \alpha_s and b-\tau unification, in
excellent agreement with all low energy experimental data. We also study the
generation of the GUT scale through radiative corrections in the context of an
R-symmetric ``flipped"" SU(5) x U(1)_X model and we find that this is possible
in a certain range of values of the parameter space.

symmetry breaking have negative pressure with respect to empty space at all but
the lowest densities, and are therefore unstable. This is a precisely defined
phenomenon which motivates the basic picture of hadrons assumed in the MIT bag
model, with nucleons as droplets of chiral symmetry restored phase. This
suggests that the phase transition to a chirally symmetric phase occurs by
percolation of preexisting droplets of the symmetric phase, and in these
proceedings we expand upon our previous presentation of this observation. At
all densities high enough that the chirally symmetric phase fills space, color
symmetry is broken by the formation of a <qq> condensate of quark Cooper pairs.
A plausible ordering scheme leads to a substantial gap in a Lorentz scalar
channel involving quarks of two colors.

"math/9803055","David Blanc","David Blanc","Loop spaces and homotopy operations",,"Fundamenta Mathematicae 154 (1997), 75-95",,,"math.AT",,"  The question of whether a given H-space X is, up to homotopy, a loop space
has been studied from a variety of viewpoints. Here we address this question
from the aspect of homotopy operations, in the classical sense of operations on
homotopy groups.
  First, we show how an H-space structure on X can be used to define the action
of the primary homotopy operations on the shifted homotopy groups \pi_{*-1} X
(which are isomorphic to \pi_* Y, if X=\Omega\Y. This action will behave
properly with respect to composition of operations if X is
homotopy-associative, and will lift to a topological action of the monoid of
all maps between spheres if and only if X is a loop space. The obstructions to
having such a topological action may be formulated in the framework of an
obstruction theory for realizing \Pi-algebras, which is simplified here by
showing that any (suitable) \Delta-simplicial space may be made into a full
simplicial space (a result which may be useful in other contexts).

using the quantum transfer matrix (QTM) approach. We find functional relations
indexed by the Takahashi-Suzuki numbers among the fusion hierarchy of the QTM's

analyticity of the latter, we derive a closed set of non-linear integral
equations which characterize the free energy and the correlation lengths for
both <sigma_j^{+} sigma_i^{-}> and <sigma_j^{z} sigma_i^{z}> at any finite
temperatures. Concerning the free energy, they exactly coincide with
Takahashi-Suzuki's TBA equations based on the string hypothesis. By solving the
integral equations numerically the correlation lengths are determined, which
agrees with the earlier results in the low temperature limit.

concept of physical clustering can be adapted to an alternative local
clustering definition. The alternative definition can preserve a detailed
valence description of the interactions between a solution species and its
near-neighbors, i.e., cooperativity and saturation of coordination for strong
association. These clusters remain finite even for condensed phases. The
simplest theory to which these developments lead is analogous to quasi-chemical
theories of cooperative phenomena. The present quasi-chemical theories require
additional consideration of packing issues because they don't impose lattice
discretizations on the continuous problem. These quasi-chemical theories do not
require pair decomposable interaction potential energy models. Since
calculations may be required only for moderately sized clusters, we suggest
that these quasi-chemical theories could be implemented with computational
tools of current electronic structure theory. This can avoid an intermediate
step of approximate force field generation.

and absorbing dielectric medium has been developed and applied to a system
consisting of two infinite half-spaces with a common planar interface (H.T.
Dung, L. Knoell, and D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A 57, in press). Here we show
that the scheme, which is based on the classical Green-tensor integral
representation of the electromagnetic field, applies to any inhomogeneous
medium. For this purpose we prove that the fundamental equal-time commutation
relations of QED are preserved for an arbitrarily space-dependent,
Kramers--Kronig consistent permittivity. Further, an extension of the
quantization scheme to linear media with bounded regions of amplification is
given, and the problem of anisotropic media is briefly addressed.
