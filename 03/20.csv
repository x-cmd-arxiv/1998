Ia) reveal a wide distribution of expansion velocities of the Fe cores,
measured from the width of the nebular lines. Moreover, the velocity appears to
correlate with the luminosity decline rate after maximum light, $\Delta
m_{15}(B)$. Since it has been shown that for SNe Ia $\Delta m_{15}(B)$
correlates with the absolute magnitude at maximum, this then implies a relation
between the expansion velocity of the Fe nebula and the luminosity at maximum.
Physically, the maximum luminosity is related to the mass of synthesized
$^{56}$Ni, whereas the FWHM of the lines is related to the kinetic energy of
the ejecta. Our finding constitutes observational proof of the theoretical
prediction that the two quantities have to be related.

double peaked structure which is consistent with gas inflow along the bar
collecting at the inner Lindblad resonance. This structure suggests that
nuclear starbursts can occur even in galaxies where this inflow/collection
occurs, in contrast to previous studies of barred spiral galaxies. However, the
observations also suggest that the double peaked emission may be the result of
a rotating molecular ring oriented nearly perpendicular to the main disk of the
galaxy. The CO J=4-3 data indicate the presence of warm gas in the nucleus that
is not apparent in the lower-J CO observations, which suggests that CO J=1-0
emission may not be a reliable tracer of molecular gas in starburst galaxies.
The twelve CI/CO J=4-3 line ratios in the inner 24'' x 24'' are uniform at the
2 sigma level, which indicates that the CO J=4-3 emission is originating in the
same hot photon-dominated regions as the CI emission. The CO J=4-3/J=3-2 line
ratios vary significantly within the nucleus with the higher line ratios
occurring away from peaks of emission along an arc of active star forming
regions. These high line ratios (>1) likely indicate optically thin gas created
by the high temperatures caused by star forming regions in the nucleus of this
starburst galaxy.

using recent stellar population synthesis models that span a wide range of
metallicities. We confirm that metallicity effects must play a role in the

assembling more recently be on average more metal-rich than older galaxies of
similar luminosity. Regardless of the true ages and metallicities of early-type

Non-Isothermal Disks","43 pages, 16 figures, to appear in The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/306047",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent work by Pringle and by Maloney, Begelman & Pringle has shown that
geometrically thin, optically thick, accretion disks are unstable to warping
driven by radiation torque from the central source. In this paper we generalize
the study of radiation-driven warping to include general power-law surface
density distributions, $\Sigma\propto R^{-\delta}$. We consider the range
$\delta=3/2$ (isothermal disks) to $\delta=-3/2$, which corresponds to a
radiation-pressure-supported disk; this spans the range of surface density
distributions likely to be found in real astrophysical disks. There is a
critical minimum size for unstable disks. The critical radius and the
steady-state precession rate depend only weakly on $\delta$. The case
$\delta=1$ divides the solutions into two qualitatively different regimes.
Nonlinear effects must be important if the warp extends to the disk inner edge
for $\delta \ge 1$, but for $\delta < 1$ nonlinearity will be important only if
the warp amplitude is large at the origin. The effects of shadowing of the
central source by the warp will thus be very different in the two regimes of
$\delta.$ In real accretion disks the outer boundary condition is likely to be
different from the zero-crossing condition that we have assumed. In accretion
disks around massive black holes in active galactic nuclei, the disk will
probably become optically thin before the outer disk boundary is reached, while
in X-ray binaries, there will be an outer disk region (outside the
circularization radius) in which the inflow velocity is zero but angular
momentum is still transported. We show that in both these cases the solutions
are similar to the zero-crossing eigenfunctions.

of glassy order and fermionic correlations, which culminates in the
implementation of Parisi replica permutation symmetry breaking (RPSB) in their
T=0 quantum field theories. Precursor effects below fermionic AT-lines become
stronger as the temperature decreases and play a crucial role within the entire
low T regime. The Parisi ultrametric structure is shown to determine low energy
excitations and the dynamic behaviour of fermionic correlations for large
times, which is predicted to affect transport properties in metallic (and
superconducting) spin glasses. Thus we reveal quantum dynamical fingerprints of
the Parisi scheme. These effects, being strongest as T->0, are contrasted with
quantum spin glass transitions at T=0 displaying only small RPSB corrections at
low T. RPSB-effects moreover appear to influence the loci of the ground state
transitions at O(T^0) and hence the phase diagrams. We derive a new
representation of the T=0 Green's function which leads to a map of the
fermionic (insulating) spin glass solution to the local limit solution of a
Hubbard model with a random repulsive interaction. We obtain the distribution
of the Hubbard interaction fluctuation and its dependence on the order of RPSB.
A generalized mapping between metallic spin glass and random U Hubbard model is
conjectured. The new representation of the Green's function at T=0 is suggested
to be useful for generalizations to superconductors with spin glass phases.

of granular materials by two dimensional traffic equations. In the absence of
vibrations the traffic equations assume two distinctive classes of fixed bed
solutions with either a spatially uniform or nonuniform density profile. The
former one exists only when the function V(\rho) that monitors the relaxation
of grains assumes a cut off at the closed packed density, \rho_c, with
V(\rho_c)=0, while the latter one exists for any form of V. Since there is
little difference between the uniform and nonuniform solution deep inside the
bed, the convective instability of the bulk may be studied by focusing on the
stability of the uniform solution. In the presence of vibrations, we find that
the uniform solution bifurcates into a bouncing solution, which then undergoes
a supercritical bifurcation to the convective instability. We determine the
onset of convection as a function of control parameters and confirm this
picture by solving the traffic equations numerically, which reveals bouncing
solutions, two convective rolls, and four convective rolls. Further, convective
patterns change as the aspect ratio changes: in a vertically long container,
the rolls move toward the surface, and in a horizontally long container, the
rolls move toward the walls. We compare these results with those reported

by quantizing the free self-dual model by means of the Dirac bracket
quantization procedure. We obtain, as result, that the free self-dual model is
a relativistically invariant quantum field theory whose excitations are
identical to the physical (gauge invariant) excitations of the free
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. The model describing the interaction of the
self-dual field minimally coupled to fermions is also quantized through the
Dirac bracket quantization procedure. One of the self-dual field components is
found not to commute, at equal times, with the fermionic fields. Hence, the
formulation of the interaction picture dynamics is only possible after the
elimination of the just mentioned component. This procedure brings, in turns,
two new interaction terms, which are local in space and time while
non-renormalizable by power counting. Relativistic invariance is tested in
connection with the elastic fermion-fermion scattering amplitude. We prove that
all the non-covariant pieces in the interaction Hamiltonian are equivalent to
the covariant minimal interaction of the self-dual field with the fermions. The
high energy behavior of the self-dual field propagator corroborates that the
coupled theory is non-renormalizable. Certainly, the self-dual field minimally
coupled to fermions bears no resemblance with the renormalizable model defined
by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons field minimally coupled to fermions.

symmetric membranes, three different membrane-topologies are possible depending
on the boundary conditions at infinity: 2+1 Minkowski topology, 2+1 wormhole
topology and 2+1 black hole topology.
  Interestingly, we find that the different membrane-topologies are connected
via phase transitions of the form first discussed by Choptuik in investigations
of scalar field collapse. More precisely, we find a first order phase
transition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology;
the intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black
hole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between
Minkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a
naked singularity.
  For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation
analogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the
parameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions.
We find that $Mass\propto|\vec{p}-\vec{p}_*|^\gamma$ where $\gamma\approx
0.66$. We also find a periodic wiggle in the scaling relation.
  Our results show that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is far
more general than expected.

as others related to them, admit a peculiar diffeomorphism symmetry, where the
transformation rule for coordinates involves the fields. The symmetry algebra
coincides with that of the Poincare group in one higher dimension. Therefore,
these models provide a nonlinear representation for a dynamical Poincare group.

approximately 30 MeV $A_y$ cannot be described by any realistic NN force. The
inclusion of existing three-nucleon forces does not improve the situation.
Because of recent questions about the $^3P_J$ NN phases, we examine whether
reasonable changes in the NN force can resolve the puzzle. In order to do this
we investigate the effect on the $^3P_J$ waves produced by changes in different
parts of the potential (viz., the central force, tensor force, etc.), as well
as on the 2-body observables and on $A_y$. We find that it is not possible with
reasonable changes in the NN potential to increase the 3-body $A_y$ and at the
same time to keep the 2-body observables unchanged. We therefore conclude that
the $A_y$ puzzle is likely to be solved by new three-nucleon forces, such as
those of spin-orbit type, which have not yet been taken into account.

derive formally simplified sets of equations in a low-speed limit analogous to
the zero Mach number limit in combustion theory.
  When viscosity is neglected and gravity is weak, the simplified system
includes: a hyperbolic equation for velocity, a parabolic equation for
temperature, an elliptic equation related to volume expansion, an
integro-differential equation for mean pressure, and an algebraic equation (the
equation of state). Solutions are determined by initial values for the mean
pressure, the temperature field, and the divergence-free part of the velocity
field. To model multidimensional flows with strong gravity, we offer an
alternative to the anelastic approximation, one which admits stratified fluids
in thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as gravity waves but not acoustic waves.
