and a red aligned optical/infrared component are used to show that the most
striking aspect of the radio-optical ``alignment effect'' in this object is due
to the interaction of the radio jet with a companion galaxy in the same group
or cluster. The stellar population of the red aligned continuum component is
predominately old, but with a small post-starburst population superposed, and
it is surrounded by a low surface-brightness halo, possibly a face-on spiral
disc. The [OIII]500.7/[OII]372.7 emission line ratio changes dramatically from
one side of the component to the other, with the low-ionisation material
apparently having passed through the bow shock of the radio source and been
compressed. A simple model for the interaction is used to explain the velocity
shifts in the emission line gas, and to predict that the ISM of the interacting
galaxy is likely to escape once the radio source bow shock has passed though.
We also discuss another, much fainter, aligned component, and the sub-arcsecond
scale alignment of the radio source host galaxy. Finally we comment on the
implications of our explanation of 3C441 for theories of the alignment effect.

generated by motion at an inner edge of the accretion disk. An increased mass
accretion rate causes the disk edge to move in, increasing the orbital
frequency. Five Type-I X-ray bursts are observed with no detectable

results conflicting with the ``canonical'' picture would be of the utmost
importance. In a number of recent papers it has been suggested that strong
evidence of a fractal distribution with dimension D~2 exists in several
samples, including Abell clusters [ACO] and galaxies from the ESO Slice Project
redshift survey [ESP].Here we report the results of an independent analysis of
the radial density run,N(<R)~R^D, of the ESP and ACO data.
  For the ESP data the situation is such that the explored volume, albeit
reasonably deep, is still influenced by the presence of large structures.
Moreover, the depth of the ESP survey (z<0.2) is such to cause noticeable
effects according to different choices of k-corrections, and this adds some
additional uncertainty in the results. However, we find that for a variety of
volume limited samples the dimensionality of the ESP sample is D~3, and the
value $D = 2$ is always excluded at the level of at least five (bootstrap)
standard deviations. The only way in which we reproduce D~2 is by both
unphysically ignoring the galaxy k-correction and using Euclidean rather than
FRW cosmological distances.
  In the cluster case the problems related to the choice of metrics and
k-correction are much lessened, and we find that ACO clusters have D_{ACO} =
3.07 +- 0.18 and D_{ACO} = 2.93 +- 0.15 for richness class R \geq 1 and R \geq
0, respectively. Therefore D=2 is excluded with high significance also for the

spectra of stars with little excess infrared emission and those with
carbon-rich dust show the least spectral variability, while stars with evidence
for dusty, oxygen-rich envelopes are most likely to show discernible variations
in their spectral profile. Most significantly, a large fraction of variable
stars with strong 9.7 micron emission features show clear spectral profile
changes which repeat from one cycle to the next. The significant sharpening of
the silicate feature near maximum light can not be fully explained by heating
and cooling of the circumstellar dust shell during the pulsational cycle,
suggesting that the dust optical properties themselves must also be varying. In
addition, the appearance of a narrow emission feature near the silicate peak
for a few stars may require the production of especially ``pure'' silicate dust
near maximum light. The general narrowing of the silicate feature observed may
reflect the evolution of the pre-existing dirty grains whose surface impurities
have been evaporated off when the grain temperature rises preceding maximum
light. An improved theory of dust formation which can explain the observed
changes in the grain properties around a single, pulsating star may lead to a
definitive explanation for the diversity of silicate emission profiles observed

present--day galaxies through the process of repeated mergers. But the recent
detection of a large concentration of these primeval galaxies (Steidel et al.

distribution of LSB dIs is very similar to that of BCDs, and marginally
different from that of dEs. We then determine the distribution of intrinsic
shapes of dI galaxies and compare to those of other type dwarf galaxies under
various assumptions. First, we assume that LSB dIs are either all oblate or all
prolate, and use non-parametric analysis to find the best-fitting distribution
of intrinsic shapes. With this assumption, we find that the scarcity of nearly
circular LSB dIs implies, at the 99% confidence level, that they cannot be a
population of randomly oriented oblate or prolate objects. Next, we assume that
dIs are triaxial, and use parametric analysis to find permissible distributions
of intrinsic shapes. We find that if the intrinsic axis ratios, $\beta$ and
$\gamma$, are distributed according to a Gaussian with means $\beta_0$ and
$\gamma_0$ and a common standard deviation of $\sigma$, the best-fitting set of
parameters for LSB dIs is $(\beta_0,\gamma_0,\sigma) = (0.66,0.50,0.15)$, and

broad wings which sometimes exceed the terminal velocity of the expanding

clear dependence of the SiO wing emission on the optical phase. These wings are
probably due to peculiar gas motions and varying physical conditions in
relation with the stellar pulsation. However, we cannot exclude other
mechanisms contributing to the observed wings. In particular, SiO turbulent
motions for the semi-regular variables or the asymmetric mass loss mechanism
may play a role. We conclude that the SiO wing emission is due to masing

1998). This new, single-step, Hipparcos calibrated method seems to be one of
the most precise techniques of distance determination with very small
statistical error due to large number of red clump stars usually available. The
distances were determined independently along four lines-of-sight located at
opposite sides of each Magellanic Cloud. The results for each line-of-sight are
very consistent. For the SMC we obtain the distance modulus:
m-M=18.56+/-0.03+/-0.06 mag (statistical and systematic errors, respectively)
and for the LMC: m-M=18.08+/-0.03+/-0.12} mag where systematic errors are
mostly due to uncertainty in reddening estimates. Both distances will be
refined and systematic errors reduced when accurate reddening maps for our
fields are available. Distance moduli to both Magellanic Clouds are ~0.4 mag
smaller than generally accepted values. The modulus to the LMC is in good
agreement with the recent determinations from RR Lyrae type stars and upper
limit resulting from the SN1987A echo. We suspect that the distance to the LMC
and SMC is shorter by about 15% than previously assumed: 42 kpc and 52 kpc,
respectively.

At any order, the relation provides explicit expressions for all the
nonvanishing coefficients of the amplitude equation together with
straightforward linear equations for the coefficients of the transformation.
The recurrence relation therefore provides all the machinery needed to solve a
given physical problem in physical terms through an amplitude equation. The new
result applies to any local bifurcation of a flow or map for which all the
critical eigenvalues are semisimple i.e. have Riesz index unity). The method is
an efficient and rigorous alternative to more intuitive approaches in terms of
multiple time scales. We illustrate the use of the method by deriving amplitude

bifurcations in flows and iterated maps. The results are expressed in tables in

frustrated spin model, with and without disorder, is considered. The model has
two phase transitions, the lower being a standard spin glass transition (in
presence of disorder) or fully frustrated Ising (in absence of disorder), and
the higher being a Potts transition. Monte Carlo results clarify that in the
model with (or without) disorder the precursor phenomena are related to the
Griffiths (or Potts) transition. The Griffiths transition is a vanishing
transition which occurs above the Potts transition and is present only when
disorder is present, while the Potts transition which signals the effect due to
frustration is always present. These results suggest that precursor phenomena
in frustrated systems are due either to disorder and/or to frustration, giving
a consistent interpretation also for the limiting cases of Ising spin glass and
of Ising fully frustrated model, where also the Potts transition is vanishing.
This interpretation could play a relevant role in glassy systems beyond the

the spectrum and the secular equations describing the excitations. We find,

that of the half filled band and consequently to the chiral invariant SU(2)

of the half filled band case: the excitations are of particle and hole type,
however they are not uniquely defined. The energy and the momentum of this
sector exhibits a tower structure corresponding to a conformal field theory
with c=1 and SU(2)xSU(2) symmetry. The energy-momentum spectrum and the zero

of the half filled case supporting the identification of the limiting model

inhomogeneities of space-time are not in contradiction with current
observational limits. A specific Lemaitre-Tolman model of a spherically
symmetric non-rotating white hole with a few adjustable parameters is
investigated. Comparison of calculated anisotropy in the Hubble flow and the
CMB against observational limits constrain the parameter space. A Copernican
principle would require that we are not too near the centre of the white hole.
As an additional constraint this predicts a value of Omega between 0.9999 and
1.

noncommutative product. This enables us to find the matrix model for M-theory
on $T^2$ with a background 3-form potential along the torus and the lightlike
circle. This matrix model is exactly the non-local 2+1 dim SYM theory on a dual

Laplace operator, the boundary conditions which require that the eigenfunctions
and their normal derivative should vanish at the boundary lead to
self-adjointness of the boundary-value problem. On studying, for simplicity,
the squared Laplace operator in one dimension, on a closed interval of the real
line, alternative conditions which also ensure self-adjointness set to zero at
the boundary the eigenfunctions and their second derivatives, or their first
and third derivatives, or their second and third derivatives, or require
periodicity, i.e. a linear relation among the values of the eigenfunctions at
the ends of the interval. For the first four choices of boundary conditions,
the resulting one-loop divergence is evaluated for a real scalar field on the
portion of flat Euclidean four-space bounded by a three-sphere, or by two
concentric three-spheres.

action method, which is used to covariantly deduce the low energy dynamics of

two-dimensional supersymmetric theories we are able to derive the appropriate
change of variables that singles out the low energy degrees of freedom. These
correspond to super-worldline embeddings in superspace which are subject to a
geometrical constraint. We obtain a supersymmetric and $\kappa$--invariant low
energy expansion, with the standard superparticle action as the leading term,
which can be used for the determination of higher-order corrections. Our
formulation fits quite naturally with the present geometrical description of
$\kappa$--symmetry in terms of the so-called geometrodynamical constraints. It
also provides a basis for the exploration of these issues in higher-dimensional
supersymmetric theories.
