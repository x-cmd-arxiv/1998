evolution of globular clusters and rich open clusters. We compare our results
with other N-body simulations and Fokker-Planck calculations. Our simulations,
performed on the GRAPE-4, employ up to 32,768 stars. The results are not in
agreement with Fokker-Planck models, in the sense that the lifetimes of stellar
systems derived using the latter are an order of magnitude smaller than those
obtained in our simulations. For our standard run, Fokker-Plank calculations
obtained a lifetime of 0.28 Gyr, while our equivalent N-body calculations find
about 4 Gyr. The principal reason for the discrepancy is that a basic
assumption of the Fokker-Plank approach is not valid for typical cluster
parameters. The stellar evolution timescale is comparable to the dynamical
timescale, and therefore the assumption of dynamical equilibrium leads to an
overestimate of the dynamical effects of mass loss. Our results suggest that
the region in parameter space for which Fokker-Planck studies of globular
cluster evolution, including the effects of both stellar evolution and the
galactic tidal field, are valid is limited. The discrepancy is largest for
clusters with short lifetimes.

scatterings are coupled with strong spatial diffusion which depends on the
scattering geometry and kinematics. The case of a slab with a finite scattering
optical depth and expansion velocity of ~ 100 kms^{-1} is investigated and it
is found that Lyman alpha photons are emergent with the linear degree of
polarization up to 10% when the typical scattering optical depth tau>=10^5. We
subsequently investigate the polarization of Lyman alpha photons emerging from
a spherical shell obscured partially by an opaque component and we obtain ~ 5 %

test of the expanding shell structure obscured by a disk-like component.

(seeing sigma_* = 0.20 - 0.56 arcsec) and V-band surface photometry (sigma_* =
0.20 - 0.26 arcsec) have been obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.
NGC 3377 is kinematically similar to M32: the central kinematic gradients are
steep. The apparent velocity dispersion rises from 95 +- 2 km/s at 1"" <= r <=
4"" to 178 +- 10 km/s at the center. To search for a central black hole, we
derive three-dimensional velocity and velocity dispersion fields that fit our
observations and Hubble Space Telescope surface photometry after projection and
seeing convolution. Isotropic models imply that the mass-to-light ratio rises
by a factor of ~ 4 at r < 2"" to M/L_V > 10. If the mass-to-light ratio of the
stars is constant with radius, then NGC 3377 contains a central massive dark
object (MDO), probably a black hole, of mass (1.8 +- 0.8) x 10**8 M_Sun.
Several arguments suggest that NGC 3377 is likely to be nearly isotropic.
However, flattened, anisotropic maximum entropy models can fit the data without
an MDO. Therefore the MDO detection in NGC 3377 is weaker than those in M31,
M32, or NGC 3115. The above MDO mass is corrected for the E5 shape of the
galaxy and for the difference between velocity moments and velocities given by
Gaussian fits to the line profiles. We show that the latter correction does not
affect the strength of the MDO detection, but it slightly reduces the mass and
mass-to-light ratio. At 3"" <= r <= 35"", M/L_V is constant at ~ 2.4. Therefore
the inner parts of NGC 3377 are dominated by a normal old stellar population,
not by halo dark matter.

probing power of these two types of observations within a generic two-parameter

previous work (by us) on binary-pulsar tests by using a sample of realistic

the gluon reggeization property, is analyzed. In particular the spectrum of the

scattering processes with also inclusive jet production. The singlet part of

double pomeron exchange and triple pomeron vertex contributions is studied. The
conformal invariance of the three pomeron vertex is shown in terms of a

the primary production amplitude is due to an effective isoscalar sigma meson
pole in a t-channel, which is enhanced strongly due to offshellness. With this
contribution included the model reproduces, both the scale and energy
dependence of the cross section.

to threshold is calculated within the frame of a chiral perturbation theory,

"physics/9803008","Radford M. Neal","Radford M. Neal","Annealed Importance Sampling",,,,"TR 9805, Dept. of Statistics, Toronto","physics.comp-ph physics.data-an",,"  Simulated annealing - moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution
of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions - has traditionally
been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain
samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for
such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain
aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional
problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise
be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the
estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs
increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second
half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a
generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance
sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for
estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is
most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of
normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful,
since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of
assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.

in a Banach space is given on the basis of the Leibniz rule, irrespective of
their explicit representations such as the G\^ateaux derivative or commutators.
This yields a unified formulation of quantum analysis, namely the invariance of
quantum derivatives, which are expressed by multiple integrals of ordinary
higher derivatives with hyperoperator variables. Multivariate quantum analysis
is also formulated in the present unified scheme by introducing a partial inner
derivation and a rearrangement formula. Operator Taylor expansion formulas are
also given by introducing the two hyperoperators $ \delta_{A \to B} \equiv
-\delta_A^{-1} \delta_B$ and $d_{A \to B} \equiv \delta_{(-\delta_A^{-1}B) ;
A}$ with the inner derivation $\delta_A : Q \mapsto [A,Q] \equiv AQ-QA$.
Physically the present noncommutative derivatives express quantum fluctuations
and responses.
