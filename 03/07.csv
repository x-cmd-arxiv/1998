form of Jupiter mass primordial black holes which betray their presence by
microlensing quasars. This lensing accounts for a number of characteristic
properties of quasar light curves, in both single quasars and gravitationally
lensed multiple systems, which are not explained on the basis of intrinsic
variation. One prediction of this idea is that Jupiter mass bodies will be
detected by the MACHO experiment as short events of about 2 days duration,
although the expected frequency of detection is still very hard to estimate.
However, the recent report by the MACHO group of the detection of a Jupiter
mass body in the direction of the Galactic bulge is consistent with this
prediction, and is possibly the first direct detection of non-baryonic matter
in the Galaxy.

  press",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01583.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Wind-blown bubbles, from those around massive O and Wolf-Rayet stars, to
superbubbles around OB associations and galactic winds in starburst galaxies,
have a dominant role in determining the structure of the Interstellar Medium.
X-ray observations of these bubbles are particularly important as most of their
volume is taken up with hot gas, 1E5 < T (K) < 1E8. However, it is difficult to
compare X-ray observations, usually analysed in terms of single or two
temperature spectral model fits, with theoretical models, as real bubbles do
not have such simple temperature distributions. In this introduction to a
series of papers detailing the observable X-ray properties of wind-blown
bubbles, we describe our method with which we aim to solve this problem,
analysing a simulation of a wind-blown bubble around a massive star. We model a
wind of constant mass and energy injection rate, blowing into a uniform ISM,
from which we calculate X-ray spectra as would be seen by the ROSAT PSPC. We
compare the properties of the bubble as would be inferred from the ROSAT data
with the true properties of the bubble in the simulation. We find standard
spectral models yield inferred properties that deviate significantly from the
true properties, even though the spectral fits are statistically acceptable,
and give no indication that they do not represent to true spectral
distribution. Our results suggest that in any case where the true source
spectrum does not come from a simple single or two temperature distribution the
""observed"" X-ray properties cannot naively be used to infer the true
properties.

well-known torque resulting from the difference in angular velocity between the
accretion disc and the star, but in addition there is a torque coming from the
interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the disc's own magnetic
field. The latter form of magnetic torque decreases in strength more slowly
with increasing radius, and will therefore dominate at large radii. The
direction of the disc field is not determined by the difference in angular
velocity between the star and the disc as in the Ghosh & Lamb model, but is
rather a free parameter. The magnetic torque may therefore either spin up or
spin down the star, and the torque changes sign if the magnetic field in the
disc reverses. I suggest that this mechanism can explain the torque reversals
that have been observed in some disc-fed X-ray pulsars.

magnitude in models including rotational mixing have been suggested. Using
recent progress in the study of the angular momentum evolution of low mass
stars, which now permits the construction of theoretical models that reproduce
the angular momentum evolution of low mass open cluster stars, along with the
observed distribution of initial angular momenta inferred from stellar rotation
data in young open clusters, we study lithium depletion in main sequence halo

with modest scatter and a small population of outliers. We also examine the
relative depletions of 6Li and 7Li finding that the dispersion in the plateau
and the 6Li/7Li depletion ratio scale with the absolute 7Li depletion. Using
observational data to bound the 7Li depletion in main sequence halo stars, we
find a maximum depletion of 0.4 dex is set by the observed dispersion and the
6Li/7Li depletion ratio, and a minimum depletion of 0.2 dex is required by both
the presence of highly overdepleted halo stars and consistency with the solar

of the February data has several peaks, the second highest of which is

simultaneous existence of two SDWs with comparable amplitudes. As the umklapp
scattering strength increases, they may become helicoidal (circularly polarized

physics at very high energy. We examine whether, from the experience gained
with the computations of various specific relic GW backgrounds, we can extract
statements and order of magnitude estimates that are as much as possible
model-independent, and we try to distinguish between general conclusions and
results related to specific cosmological mechanisms. We examine the statement
that the Virgo/LIGO experiments probe the Universe at temperatures $T\sim
10^{7}-10^{10}$ GeV (or timescales $t\sim 10^{-20}-10^{-26}$ sec) and we
consider the possibility that they could actually probe the Universe at much
higher energy scales, including the typical scales of grand unification, string
theory and quantum gravity. We consider possible scenarios, depending on how
the inflationary paradigm is implemented. We discuss the prospects for
detection with present and planned experiments. In particular, a second Virgo
interferometer correlated with the planned one, and located within a few tens
of kilometers from the first, could reach an interesting sensitivity for
stochastic GWs of cosmological origin.

a fully connected 3D BSE. This result is a 3-body generalization of a similar

corresponding qq-bar BS kernel under Covariant Instaneity (CIA for short). (The
generalization from spinless to fermion quarks is straightforward).
  To set the CIA with 3D BS kernel support ansatz in the context of
contemporary approaches to the qqq baryon problem, a model scalar 4D qqq BSE
with pairwise contact interactions to simulate the NJL-Faddeev equations is
worked out fully, and a comparison of both vertex functions shows that the CIA
vertex reduces exactly to the NJL form in the limit of zero spatial range. This
consistency check on the CIA vertex function is part of a fuller accounting for
its mathematical structure whose physical motivation is traceable to the role
of `spectroscopy' as an integral part of the dynamics.
