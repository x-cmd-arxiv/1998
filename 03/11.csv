maximum- likelihood algorithm, from the positions and tangential velocities of
a kinematically unbiased sample of 14369 stars observed by the HIPPARCOS
satellite. f(v) shows rich structure in the radial and azimuthal motions, v_R
and v_phi, but not in the vertical velocity, v_z: there are four prominent and
many smaller maxima, many of which correspond to well known moving groups.
While samples of early-type stars are dominated by these maxima, also up to 25%
of red main-sequence stars are associated with them. These moving groups are
responsible for the vertex deviation measured even for samples of late-type
stars; they appear more frequently for ever redder samples; and as a whole they
follow an asymmetric-drift relation, in the sense that those only present in
red samples predominantly have large |v_R| and lag in v_phi w.r.t. the local
standard of rest (LSR). The question arise, how these old moving groups got on
their eccentric orbits. A plausible mechanism, known from solar system
dynamics, which is able to manage a shift in orbit space involves locking into
an orbital resonance.
  Apart from these moving groups, there is a smooth background distribution,
akin to Schwarzschild's ellipsoidal model, with axis ratio of about 1:0.6:0.35
in v_R, v_phi, and v_z. The contours are aligned with the $v_r$ direction, but
not w.r.t. the v_phi and v_z axes: the mean v_z increases for stars rotating
faster than the LSR. This effect can be explained by the stellar warp of the
Galactic disk. If this explanation is correct, the warp's inner edge must not
be within the solar circle, while its pattern rotates with frequency of about
13 km/s/kpc or more retrograde w.r.t. the stellar orbits.

study departures from the universal density profiles recently found to arise in
cosmological settings. However, we found that even for models which exhibit
quite a different formation history, the density and velocity dispersion
profiles of the virialized halos are strikingly similar.
  Power law density profiles do not result even in models with initial power
law profiles and no initial substructure or non-radial motions. Such initial
conditions give rise to a radial orbit instability which leads to curved
velocity dispersion and density profiles. The shapes of the density profiles in
all our models are well parameterized by the profiles of halos formed in a
generic cosmological setting. Our results show that the universality of dark
halo density profiles does not depend crucially on hierarchical merging as has
been suggested recently in the literature. Rather it arises because apparently
different collapse histories produces a near universal angular momentum
distribution among the halo particles. We conclude that the density and
velocity dispersion profiles of virialized halos in an expanding universe are
robust outcomes of gravitational collapse, nearly independent of the initial
conditions and the formation history.

optical galaxies over much larger and independent volumes. By comparing the
correlation function calculated in redshift and real space we find that the
redshift distortion on intermediate scales is small. This result implies that
the observed redshift-space distribution of galaxies is close to that in real
space, and that beta = Omega^{0.6}/b < 1, where Omega is the cosmological
density parameter and b is the linear biasing factor for optical galaxies. We
also use the SSRS2 to study the dependence of xi on the internal properties of

clustered than sub-L* galaxies and that the luminosity segregation is
scale-independent. We find that early types are more clustered than late types,
but that in the absence of rich clusters, the relative bias between early and
late types in real space, is not as strong as previously estimated.
Furthermore, both morphologies present a luminosity-dependent bias, with the
early types showing a slightly stronger dependence on luminosity. We also find
that red galaxies are significantly more clustered than blue ones, with a mean
relative bias stronger than that seen for morphology. Finally, we find that the

difference between this work and previous work is that we use more recent
opacity data from the OPAL project. Since, in general, these opacities are
higher than those available ten years ago, at a given effective temperature,
convection zones go deeper than in models with older opacity data. Thus
convective dredge-up of observationally detectable carbon in helium atmosphere
white dwarfs can occur for thicker helium layers than found by Pelletier et al
(1986). We find that the range of observed C to He ratios in different DQ white
dwarfs of similar effective temperature is well explained by a range of initial
helium layer mass between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, in good agreement
with stellar evolution theory, assuming a typical white dwarf mass of $0.6
M_{\odot}$. We also predict that oxygen will be present in DQ white dwarf

source. Like the Sy2's, they have central surface brightnesses consistent with
those expected for the bulges of normal galaxies. The frequency of bars in

likely to show nuclear dust absorption, especially in lanes and patches which

our morphology classifications, which show that Sy1 nuclei reside in earlier
type galaxies than Sy2 nuclei. This intrinsic difference in host galaxy
properties may undermine the strong unification hypothesis for Sy galaxies that
they appear different due to the orientation of their central engine. The
excess galactic dust we see in Sy2's may cause substantial absorption which
obscures their hypothesized broad emission-line regions and central nonstellar
continua. This galactic dust could produce much of the absorption in Sy2 nuclei
which had instead been attributed to a thick dusty accretion torus.

to detect a number of spectral features. Between 0.1 and 10 keV the spectrum
can be well described by a convex spectrum with (energy) slope gradually
steepening from 1.1 to 1.6. At higher energies evidence for a sharp spectral
hardening is found, while in the soft X-rays (0.1-1.0 keV) some evidence for an
absorption feature was found. Indication for an emission line at 6.4 keV in the
source rest frame is present. Repeated variability of $\approx 20-30%$ around
the mean flux is clearly detected on time scales of a few hours. From the
symmetry and timescale of the observed variations we derive limits on the
magnetic field and on the maximum energy of the emitting particles, implying
that PKS 2155-304 should not be bright at TeV energies.

relaxation time $\tau_\phi$ can be orders of magnitude longer than the momentum
relaxation time. The large difference in these time scales gives rise to well
known effects of weak localization, such as anomalous magnetoresistance. Among
other interesting characteristics, study of these effects provide quantitative
information on the dephasing rate $1/\tau_\phi$. This parameter is of
fundamental interest: the relation between $\hbar/\tau_\phi$ and the
temperature $T$ (a typical energy scale of an electron) determines how well a
single electron state is defined. We will discuss the basic physical meaning of
$1/\tau_\phi$ in different situations and its difference from the energy
relaxation rate. At low temperatures, the phase relaxation rate is governed by
collisions between electrons. We will review existing theories of dephasing by
these collisions or (which is the same) by electric noise inside the sample. We

resolve this contradiction we discuss dephasing by an external microwave field

fluctuation, staggered gauge field fluctuation plays a crucial role in the

for the cuprates. By including the staggered gauge field fluctuation we
calculate the spectral function of the electrons by RPA(random phase
approximation). The line shape of the spectral function near $(\pi,0)$ is very
broad in underdoped case and is quite sharp in overdoped case. For the spectral
function near $(0.5\pi,0.5\pi)$, the quasiparticle peaks are always very sharp
in both underdoped and overdoped case. The temperature dependence of the
spectral function is also discussed in our present calculation. These results
fit well with the recent ARPES experiments. We also calculate the FS crossover
from a small four segment like FS to a large continuous FS. The reason of such
kind of FS crossover is ascribed to the staggered gauge field fluctuation which
is strong in underdoped regime and becomes much weaker in overdoped regime. The
pseudo gap extracted from the ARPES data can be also interpreted by the

duality in SQCD links many previously known duality transformations that were
thought to be distinct, including Olive-Montonen duality of N=4 supersymmetric
gauge theory and quark-hadron duality in (S)QCD. A link between Olive-Montonen
duality and the confining strings of (S)QCD is explained, in which a picture of
confinement via non-abelian monopole condensation --- a generalized dual
Meissner effect --- emerges explicitly. In this picture, unlike previous ones,
the confining flux tubes carry the correct Z_N discrete charges. A number of
studies of these subjects, which could be carried out using lattice gauge

from two shuffle algebras: one for nested sums; the other for iterated
integrals. Each diagram evaluates to 10 000 digits in seconds, because the
primitive words are transformable to exponentially convergent single sums, as
recently shown for $\zeta(3)$ and $\zeta(5)$, familiar in QCD. Those are
SC$^*(2)$ constants, whose base of super-fast computation is 2. Mass involves

interesting realistic models, and (b) the results of a recent search for duals

topology, It comes equipped with a $\BZ$-grading by {\it fermionic charge}, and
the {\it chiral de Rham differential} $d_{DR}^{ch}$, which is an endomorphism
of degree 1 such that $(d_{DR}^{ch})^2=0$. One has a canonical embedding of the
usual de Rham complex $(\Omega_X, d_{DR})\hra (\Omega_X^{ch}, d_{DR}^{ch})$
which is a quasiisomorphism.
  If $X$ is Calabi-Yau then this sheaf admits an N=2 supersymmetry. For some
$X$ (for example, for curves or for the flag spaces $G/B$), one can construct
also a purely even analogue of this sheaf, a {\it chiral structure sheaf}
$\CO^{ch}_X$. For the projective line, the space of global sections of the last
sheaf is the irreducible vacuum $\hsl(2)$-module on the critical level.

The longitudinal and transverse radial expansion parameters and the mean

presented. The predictions of the RQMD model with and without mean field
potentials are compared to our data. Both variants of RQMD are parameterized in
terms of the Blast Wave model and the results of such parameterizations are
compared to the experimental ones. It is found that inclusion of the mean field
