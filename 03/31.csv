majority contribution from any of the following: PAGB stars more massive than
0.56 Msun, main sequence stars, or blue stragglers. Both the the luminosity
functions and color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with a dominant
population of stars that have evolved from the extreme horizontal branch (EHB)
along tracks with masses between 0.47 and 0.53 Msun. These stars are well below
the detection limits of our images while on the zero-age EHB, but become
detectable while in the more luminous (but shorter) AGB-Manque' and post-early
asymptotic giant branch (PEAGB) phases. The FOC observations require that only
a only a very small fraction of the main sequence population (2% in M 31 and
0.5% in M 32) in these two galaxies evolve though the EHB and post-EHB phases,
with the remainder evolving through bright PAGB evolution that is so rapid that
few if any stars are expected in the small field of view covered by the FOC.

magnetic reconnection processes operating in externally agitated magnetized
plasmas. An especially interesting environment for such a process are the
coronae of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (AGN). There, Keplerian
shear flows perturb the quite strong disk magnetic field leading to intense
current sheets. It was previously shown that given field strengths of 200 G in
a shear flow, reconnection driven magnetic field aligned electric fields can
accelerate electrons up to Lorentz factors of about 2000 in those objects thus
providing us with a possible solution of the injection (pre-acceleration)
problem. However, whereas in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics the
formation of the field-aligned electric fields can be described consistently,
the question has to be addressed whether the charged particles can really be
accelerated up to the maximum energy supplied by the field-aligned electric
potentials, since the accelerated particles undergo energy losses either by
synchrotron or inverse Compton mechanisms. We present relativistic particle
simulations starting from electric and magnetic fields obtained from
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetic reconnection in an idealized AGN
configuration including nonthermal radiative losses. The numerical results
prove that the relativistic electrons can be effectively accelerated even in
the presence of an intense radiation bath. Energies from 50 MeV up to 40 GeV
can be reached easily, depending on the energy density of the photon bath.

investigate the lifetime of the chemical legacy left in the wake of C-type

which are predicted to have abundances that are significantly affected in
shock-heated gas. Two models are presented: (1) a three-stage model of
pre-shock, shocked, and post-shock gas; and (2) a Monte-Carlo cloud simulation
where we explore the effects of stochastic shock activity on molecular gas over
a cloud lifetime. In agreement with previous studies, we find that shock
velocities in excess of 10 km s^-1 are required to convert all of the oxygen
not locked in CO into H2O before the gas has an opportunity to cool. For pure
gas-phase models the lifetime of the high water abundances, or ``H2O legacy'',
in the post-shock gas is 4 - 7 x 10^5 years. Through the Monte Carlo cloud
simulation we demonstrate that the time-average abundance of H2O is a sensitive
function of the frequency of shocks. Thus we predict that the abundance of H2O
and other known outflow tracers can be used to trace the history of shock
activity in molecular gas. For gas-grain models we find that the abundance of
water-ice on grain surfaces can be quite large and is comparable to that
observed in molecular clouds. This offers a possible alternative method to
create water mantles without resorting to grain surface chemistry: gas heating
and chemical modification due to a C-type shock and subsequent depletion of the
gas-phase species onto grain mantles.

Nevertheless, some numerical simulations of gravitational collapse with a
toroidal event horizon or the collision of event horizons are reported.
Considering the indifferentiability of the event horizon (EH), we see that such
non-trivial TOEHs are caused by the set of endpoints (the crease set) of the
EH. The two-dimensional (one-dimensional) crease set is related to the toroidal
EH (the coalescence of the EH). Furthermore, examining the stability of the
structure of the endpoints, it becomes clear that the spherical TOEH is
unstable under linear perturbation. On the other hand, a discussion based on
catastrophe theory reveals that the TOEH with handles is stable and generic.
Also, the relation between the TOEH and the hoop conjecture is discussed. It is
shown that the Kastor-Traschen solution is regarded as a good example of the
hoop conjecture by the discussion of its TOEH. We further conjecture that a
non-trivial TOEH can be smoothed out by rough observation in its mass scale.

propagator, which, due to the presence of the string, now contains many
different contributions, comes out strictly transversal in one-loop order.

the calculation of the anomalous dimensions and the beta-function. This is
technically simpler because only the divergent contributions of the integrals
have to be determined. The beta-function becomes independent of the gauge
parameter as it should. A puzzle with respect to the principle of minimal

interaction couples one quark color-charge density to another, much as electric

In QCD, this nonlocal interaction also couples quark color-charge densities to
gluonic color. We show how the leading part of the interaction between quark
color-charge densities vanishes when the participating quarks are in a color
singlet configuration, and that, for singlet configurations, the residual
interaction weakens as the size of a packet of quarks shrinks. Because of this
effect, color-singlet packets of quarks should experience final state
interactions that increase in strength as these packets expand in size. For the
case of an SU(2) model of QCD based on the {\em ansatz} that the
gauge-invariant gauge field is a hedgehog configuration, we show how the
infinite series that represents the nonlocal interaction between quark
color-charge densities can be evaluated nonperturbatively, without expanding it

for the first two processes are obtained from an one-boson-exchange model,
while that for the last process is taken to be the Breit-Wigner form through
the phi meson resonance. For dileptons with invariant mass near the phi meson
peak, we also include contributions from neutron-proton bremsstrahlung,
pion-pion annihilation, and the decay of rho and omega mesons produced in
baryon-baryon and meson-baryon collisions. Effects due to medium modifications
of the kaon and vector (rho, omega and phi) meson properties are investigated.
We find that the kaon medium effects lead to a broadening of the dilepton
spectrum as a result of the increase of phi meson decay width. Furthermore, the
dropping of phi meson mass in nuclear medium leads to a shoulder structure in
the dilepton spectrum besides the main peak at the bare phi meson mass. The
experimental measurement of the dilepton spectra from heavy-ion collisions is
expected to provide useful information about the phi meson properties in dense
matter.
