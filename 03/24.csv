  Giraud-Heraud, (Paris, France: Editions Frontieres)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Fourteen classical double radio galaxies with redshifts between zero and two
were used to determine the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$, and $\Omega_k$, where these are the normalized values of
the mean mass density, cosmological constant, and space curvature at the
present epoch. A low value of $\Omega_m$ is obtained, and $\Omega_m = 1$ is
ruled out with 97.5% confidence. The low value of $\Omega_m$ determined using
the radio source method described here is also indicated by several independent
tests. Thus, it appears that either a cosmological constant, or space
curvature, is significant at the present epoch. This means that the universe is
undergoing, or has recently undergone, a transition away from a state of matter
domination and into a state where either a cosmological constant or space
curvature is determining the expansion rate of the universe. The low value of
$\Omega_m$ presented here and by Guerra & Daly (1998) means that we can state
with 97.5 % confidence that the universe will continue to expand forever.

Dgani, Evans & White (1998) claim that the emission, located in the inner
region, is probably dominated by nonthermal emission.
  We propose a model to explain this.
  We assume that the fast wind, blown by the central star of A30 carries a very
weak magnetic field. The interaction of this wind with a cluster of dense
condensations traps the magnetic field lines for a long time and stretches
them, leading to a strong magnetic field.
  If relativistic particles are formed as the fast wind is shocked, then the
enhanced magnetic field will result in nonthermal radio emission.
  The typical nonthermal radio flux at 1 GHz can be up to several milli-Jansky.
  In order to detect the nonthermal emission, the emitting region should be
spatially resolved from the main optical nebula.
  We list other planetary nebulae which may possess nonthermal radio emission.

similar variability components. In the X-ray color-color diagram the source did
not trace out the usual banana branch, but showed a two branched structure.
  This is the first detection of a QPO in one of the four persistently bright

flux can be larger than photon flux, due to absorption of the latter on
radiobackground, while monopolonia and relic particles are concentrated in the
Galactic halo, and the photon flux dominates. Another signature of the latter
sources is anisotropy imposed by asymmetric position of the sun in the Galactic

mapping from one set of data onto the pixel basis of another. For more
quantitative analyses we develop and apply both Bayesian and frequentist
techniques. We define the ``contamination parameter'' and advocate the
calculation of its probability distribution as a means of examining the
consistency of two datasets. The closely related ``probability enhancement
factor'' is shown to be a useful statistic for comparison; it is significantly
better than a number of chi-squared quantities we consider. Our methods can be
used: internally (between different subsets of a dataset) or externally
(between different experiments); for observing regions that completely overlap,
partially overlap or overlap not at all; and for observing strategies that
differ greatly.

old pulsar PSR B0906-49. In an image containing only off-pulse emission, we
find a weak, slightly extended source coincident with the pulsar's position,

emission extending behind the pulsar aligns with the major axis of the PWN, and
implies that the pulsar is moving north-west with projected velocity ~60 km/s,
consistent with its scintillation speed. The consequent density we infer for
the pulsar's environment is >2 cm^(-3), so that the PWN around PSR B0906-49 is
confined mainly by the high density of its surroundings rather than by the
pulsar's velocity. Other properties of the system such as the PWN's low
luminosity and apparent steep spectrum, and the pulsar's large characteristic
age, lead us to suggest that this nebula is substantially different from other
radio PWNe, and may represent a transition between young pulsars with prominent
radio PWNe and older pulsars for which no radio PWN has been detected. We
recommend that further searches for radio PWNe should be made as here: at low
frequencies and with the pulsed emission subtracted.

stars, which isochrones indicate have ages between 0.1 and 10 Gyr, dominates
the (K, J-K) color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of each galaxy. The detection of
significant numbers of AGB stars with ages near 10 Gyr indicates that the disks

Star-forming activity in the central arcmin of NGC300 has been suppressed for
the past Gyr with respect to disk fields at larger radii. Nevertheless,
comparisons between fields within each galaxy indicate that star-forming
activity during intermediate epochs was coherent on spatial scales of a kpc or
more. A large cluster of stars, which isochrones suggest has an age near 100

assumed in previous studies. As a model for the inhomogeneity of the
cosmological magnetic field, we adopt a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation,
where the field is passively included, and can approximately represent the real
field distribution with an arbitrary normalization for the field strength.
Then, we derive an upper limit of the magnetic field strength by comparing the
observed limit of rotational measure with the rotational measure expected from
the magnetic field geometry in the simulated model universe. The resulting
upper limit to the magnetic field in filaments and sheets is ${\bar B}_{fs} \la
1 \mu G$ which is $\sim10^3$ times higher than the previously quoted values.
This value is close to, but larger than, the equipartition magnetic field
strength in filaments and sheets. The amplification mechanism of the magnetic

usually performed by assuming that the underlying noise is uncorrelated.
Spatial noise correlation is however present in practice due to various
observational effects and can affect source shape parameters. This effect is
particularly important for measurements of weak gravitational lensing, for
which the sought image distortions are typically of the order of only 1%. We
compute the effect of correlated noise on two-dimensional gaussian fits in full
generality. The noise properties are naturally quantified by the noise
autocorrelation function (ACF), which is easily measured in practice. We
compute the resulting bias on the mean, variance and covariance of the source
parameters, and the induced correlation between the shapes of neighboring
sources. We show that these biases are of second order in the inverse
signal-to-noise ratio of the source, and could thus be overlooked if bright
stars are used to monitor systematic distortions. Radio interferometric surveys
are particularly prone to this effect because of the long-range pixel
correlations produced by the Fourier inversion involved in their image
construction. As a concrete application, we consider the search for weak
lensing by large-scale structure with the FIRST radio survey. We measure the
noise ACF for a FIRST coadded field, and compute the resulting ellipticity
correlation function induced by the noise. In comparison with the weak-lensing
signal expected in CDM models, the noise correlation effect is important on
small angular scales, but is negligible for source separations greater than
about 1 arcmin. We also discuss how noise correlation can affect weak-lensing

their evolved density profiles. In this model, halos are spherical and form by
quiescent accretion of matter in clumps, called satellites. The halo mass as a
function of redshift is given by the mass of the most massive progenitor, and
is determined from Monte-Carlo realizations of the merger-history tree. Inside
the halo, satellites move under the action of the gravitational force of the
halo and a dynamical friction drag force. The associated equation of motion is
solved numerically. The energy lost to dynamical friction is transferred to the
halo in the form of kinetic energy. As they sink into the halo, satellites
continually lose matter as a result of tidal stripping. The stripped matter
moves inside the halo free of dynamical friction. The evolved density profiles
are steeper than those obtained by assuming that, once they have been accreted
onto the parent halo, satellites remain at a fixed distance from the halo
center. We find that the final density profile depends mainly on the rate of
infall of matter onto the halo. This, in turn, depends on the initial
fluctuation field as well as on cosmology. For mass scales where the effective
spectral index of the initial density field is less than -1, the model predicts
a profile which can only approximately be matched by the one parameter family
of curves suggested by Navarro, Frenk and White (1997). For scale-free
power-spectra with initial slope $n$, the density profile within about 1% of
the virial radius is $\rho\propto r^{-\beta}$, with $3(3+n)/(5+n)\le\beta\le

$R_E$, and remains substantial outside this zone. In this Letter, we point out
that this result implies that, regardless of orientation, all Jovian mass
planets with separations near 0.6--1.6$R_E$ dramatically affect the central
region of the magnification pattern, and thus have a significant probability of
being detected (or ruled out) in high magnification events. The probability,
averaged over all orbital phases and inclination angles, of two planets having
projected separations within 0.6--$1.6R_E$ is substantial: 1-15% for two
planets with the intrinsic orbital separations of Jupiter and Saturn orbiting
around 0.3--1.0$M_\odot$ parent stars. We illustrate by example the complicated
magnification patterns and light curves that can result when two planets are
present, and discuss possible implications of our result on detection
efficiencies and the ability to discriminate between multiple and single
planets in high magnification events.

deterministic setting - with thermal noise being replaced by one-dimensional
chaos. The piecewise linear map investigated in the paper shows a transition
from symmetry-broken to symmetric chaos on increasing a system parameter. In
the latter state, the chaotic trajectory switches between the two formerly
disjoint attractors, driven by the map's inherent dynamics. This chaotic
switching rate is found to `resonate' with the frequency of an externally
applied periodic perturbation (multiplicative or additive). By periodically
modulating the parameter at a specific frequency $\omega$, we observe the
existence of resonance where the response of the system (in terms of the
residence-time distribution) is maximum. This is a clear indication of SR-like
behavior in a chaotic system.

($1/m_b^2)$ corrections to the hadronic invariant mass and hadron energy
spectra in the decay $B \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$ in standard model. This is done
both by using the heavy quark expansion technique (HQET) and a perturbative-QCD
improved Fermi motion (FM) model which takes into account $B$-meson
wave-function effects. The corrections in the hadron energy ($E_H$) spectrum
are found to be small over a good part of this spectrum in both the methods.
However, the expansion in $1/m_b$ in HQET fails near the lower kinematic
end-point and at the $c\bar{c}$ threshold. The hadronic invariant mass ($S_H$)
spectrum is calculable only over a limited range $S_H > \bar{\Lambda}m_B$ in
the heavy quark expansion, where $\bar{\Lambda} \simeq m_B-m_b$. We also
present results for the first two hadronic moments $< S_H^n>$ and $< E_H^n>$,
$n=1,2$, working out their sensitivity on the HQET and FM model parameters. For
equivalent values of these parameters, the moments in these methods are
remarkably close to each other. Using the FM model, we study the effect of the
experimental cuts, used recently by the CLEO collaboration in searching for the
decay $B \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$, on the hadron spectra and hadronic invariant
mass moments. The constraints following from assumed values of $< S_H^n>$ on

the forthcoming B facilities could be used to measure the short-distance
contribution in $B \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$ and determine the HQET parameters

the free relativistic massless particle and the hydrogen atom in any number of

position and momentum (x,p) as a doublet in phase space. As a consequence of
the gauging, the Minkowski space-time vectors (x^\mu, p^\mu) get enlarged by
one additional space-like and one additional time-like dimensions to (x^M,p^M).
A manifest global symmetry SO(d,2) rotates (x^M,p^M) like d+2 dimensional
vectors. The SO(d,2) symmetry of the parent theory may be interpreted as the
familiar conformal symmetry of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime in
one gauge, or as the dynamical symmetry of a totally different physical system
in another gauge. Thanks to the gauge symmetry, the theory permits various
choices of ``time'' which correspond to different looking Hamiltonians, while
avoiding ghosts. Thus we demonstrate that there is a physical role for a
spacetime with two times when taken together with a gauged duality symmetry

Witten and Maldacena. We discuss the effects of vortices and monopoles on the
open world-sheets whose boundaries are Wilson loops of the target-space (non

with the target-space embedding of such defects, we argue that the apprearance
of five-dimensional Anti-De-Sitter (AdS) space times is quite natural, as a
result of Liouville dressing.We isolate the world-sheet defect contributions to
the Wilson loop by constructing an appropriate observable, which is the same as
the second observable in the supersymmetric U(1) theory of Awada and Mansouri,
but in our approach supersymmetry is not necessary.When vortex condensation
occurs, we argue in favour of a (low-temperature) confining phase, in the sense
of an area law, for a large-$N_c$ (conformal) gauge theory at finite
temperatures. A connection of the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transitions on the world-sheet with the critical temperatures in the

  A pseudo-isomorphism between two triads is a morphism of complexes which
induces an isomorphism on the functors $ h_0 (L\otimes .)$ and a monomorphism
on the functors $h_{-1} (L\otimes .)$. One says that two triads are
pseudo-isomorphic if they are connected by a chain of pseudo-isomorphisms.

pseudo-isomorphism, and we show that the map $\{\hbox{families of curves}\}\to

  Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society",,"10.1002/qj.49712555710",,"physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph",,"  The maximum measured electric fields in thunderclouds are an order of
magnitude less than the fields required for electric breakdown of the air. One
explanation for lightning initiation in these low fields is that electric
breakdown first occurs at the surfaces of raindrops where the ambient field is
enhanced very locally due to the drop geometry. Laboratory experiments [Crabb &
Latham, 1974] indicate that colliding raindrops which coalesce to form
elongated water filaments can produce positive corona in ambient fields close
to those measured in thunderclouds.
  We calculate the E-field distribution around a simulated coalesced drop pair
and use a numerical model to study the positive corona mechanisms in detail.
Our results give good agreement with the laboratory observations. At the
altitudes (and thus low pressures) at which lightning initiation is observed,
our results show that positive corona can occur at observed in-cloud E-fields.

layer of magnetized plasma is considered at present work. The plasma electron
density irregularities are described by spatial spectrum of an arbitrary form.
The small-angle scattering approximation in the invariant ray coordinates is
suggested for analytical investigation of the radiation transfer equation. The
approximated solution describing spatial-and-angular distribution of radiation
reflected from a plasma layer has been obtained. The obtained solution has been
investigated numerically for the case of the ionospheric radio wave
propagation. Two effects are the consequence of multiple scattering: change of
the reflected signal intensity and anomalous refraction.

be considered as $T$ iterated applications of black box representing $f$,
beginning with input word $x$ of length $n$.
  It is proved that if $T=O(2^{n/(7+e)}), e >0$, and $f$ is chosen randomly
then with probability 1 every quantum computer requires not less than $T$
evaluations of $f$ to obtain the result of classical computation. It means that
the set of classical algorithms admitting quantum speeding up has probability
measure zero.
  The second result is that for arbitrary classical time complexity $T$ and $f$
chosen randomly with probability 1 every quantum simulation of classical
computation requires at least $\Omega (\sqrt {T})$ evaluations of $f$.

For all these Poisson discretizations a solution in terms of elliptic functions
is found, allowing a direct comparison with the continuous time case. We
demonstrate that the Veselov--Moser discretization also belongs to our family,
and apply our methods to this particular example.
