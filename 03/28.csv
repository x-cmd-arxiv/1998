selected weak-line T Tauri stars in the nearby Scorpius-Centaurus OB
association. We find that for binary T Tauri stars closely associated to the
early type stars in Upper Scorpius, the youngest subgroup of the OB
association, the peak in the distribution of binary separations is at 90 A.U.
For binary T Tauri stars located in the direction of an older subgroup, but not
closely associated to early type stars, the peak in the distribution is at 215
A.U. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that the two binary populations do not
result from the same distibution at a significance level of 98%. Apparently,
the same physical conditions which facilitate the formation of massive stars
also facilitate the formation of closer binaries among low-mass stars, whereas
physical conditions unfavorable for the formation of massive stars lead to the
formation of wider binaries among low-mass stars. The outcome of the binary
formation process might be related to the internal turbulence and the angular
momentum of molecular cloud cores, magnetic field, the initial temperature
within a cloud, or - most likely - a combination of all of these. We conclude
that the distribution of binary separations is not a universal quantity, and
that the broad distribution of binary separations observed among main-sequence
stars can be explained by a superposition of more peaked binary distributions
resulting from various star forming environments. The overall binary frequency
among pre-main-sequence stars in individual star forming regions is not
necessarily higher than among main-sequence stars.

to gravitational interactions, gas pressure, and shock heating, we include
bremsstrahlung cooling in the computation. Dynamical time, two-body relaxation
time, and cooling time in the simulations are examined to demonstrate that the
results are free from artificial relaxation effects and that the time step is
short enough to accurately follow the evolution of the system. In the
simulation with nominal resolution of 66h^{-1} kpc the computed cluster appears
normal, but in a higher (by a factor 2) resolution run, cooling is so efficient
that the final gas density profile shows a steep rise toward the cluster center
that is not observed in real clusters. Also, the X-ray luminosity of
7\times10^{45} ergs s^{-1} far exceeds that for any cluster of the computed
temperature. The most reasonable explanation for this discrepancy is that there
are some physical processes still missing in the simulations that actually
mitigate the cooling effect and play a crucial role in the thermal and
dynamical evolution of the gas near the center. Among the promising candidate
processes are heat conduction and heat input from supernovae. We discuss the
extent to which these processes can alter the evolution of gas.

using the so-called minimal supergravity scenario, where one assumes a
universal scalar mass, gaugino mass, and trilinear coupling at M_{GUT}. Even
though this is a useful simplifying assumption for phenomenological analyses,
it is rather too restrictive to accommodate a large variety of phenomenological
possibilities. It predicts, among other things, that the lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) is an almost pure B-ino, and that the
mu-parameter is larger than the masses of the SU(2)_{L} and U(1)_{Y} gauginos.
We extend the minimal supergravity framework by introducing one extra
parameter: the Fayet--Iliopoulos D-term for the hypercharge U(1), D_Y. Allowing
for this extra parameter, we find a much more diverse phenomenology, where the
LSP is \tilde{\nu}_{\tau}, \tilde{\tau} or a neutralino with a large higgsino
content. We discuss the relevance of the different possibilities to collider
signatures. The same type of extension can be done to models with the gauge
mediation of supersymmetry breaking. We argue that it is not wise to impose

derivation of the conserved currents, their algebras and the exact solution of
these models is presented. An important property of this class of models is the
affine $SL(2,R)_q$ algebra spanned by charges of the chiral and antichiral
nonlocal currents and the U(1) charge. The classical (Poisson Brackets)
algebras of symmetries $V{G_n}$ of these models appears to be of mixed
PF-$W{G_n}$ type. They contain together with the local quadratic terms specific
for the $W_n$-algebras the nonlocal terms similar to the ones of the classical
PF-algebra. The renormalization of the spins of the nonlocal currents is the
main new feature of the quantum $V{A_n}$-algebras. The quantum $V{A_2}$-algebra
and its degenerate representations are studied in detail.

coupled heterotic string is a gauged version of N=1 five-dimensional

supermultiplets, this theory is explicitly constructed by a generalized
dimensional reduction procedure on a Calabi-Yau manifold. A crucial ingredient
in the reduction is the retention of a ""non-zero mode"" of the four-form field
strength, leading to the gauging of the universal hypermultiplet by the
graviphoton. We show that this theory has an exact three-brane domain wall
solution which reduces to Witten's ""deformed"" Calabi-Yau background upon
linearization. This solution consists of two parallel three-branes with sources
provided by the four-dimensional boundary theories and constitutes the
appropriate background for a reduction to four dimensions. Four-dimensional
space-time is then identified with the three-brane worldvolume.

is the main theme. We explain it taking simple examples of $\pl\pl h-, {and}

latter is not finitely generated. This improves on a result of Grunewald,
