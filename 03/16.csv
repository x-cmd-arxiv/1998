using quasar spectra to investigate possible time or space variation in the
fine structure constant, alpha. Applying the technique to a sample of 30
absorption systems, spanning redshifts 0.5 < z< 1.6, obtained with the Keck I
telescope, we derive limits on variations in alpha over a wide range of epochs.
For the whole sample Delta(alpha)/alpha = -1.1 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-5}. This
deviation is dominated by measurements at z > 1, where Delta(alpha)/alpha =
-1.9 +/- 0.5 x 10^{-5}. For z < 1, Delta(alpha)/alpha = -0.2 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-5},
consistent with other known constraints. Whilst these results are consistent
with a time-varying alpha, further work is required to explore possible
systematic errors in the data, although careful searches have so far not
revealed any.

sites for the high-energy radiation and the unseen radio beams. We estimate
that (a) the radio beaming fraction of young pulsars is roughly 50%, certainly

brightness profile inside a radius ~1.5"" (100 pc) is well represented by a

recently been found in a variety of systems ranging from rupture, earthquakes,
Laplacian growth phenomena, ``animals'' in percolation to financial market
crashes. We believe it to be a quite general, albeit subtle phenomenon. Indeed,
the practical problem in uncovering an underlying discrete scale invariance is
that standard ensemble averaging procedures destroy it as if it was pure noise.
This is due to the fact, that while c only depends on the underlying physics,
l0 on the contrary is realisation-dependent. Here, we adapt and implement a
novel so-called ``canonical'' averaging scheme which re-sets the l0 of
different realizations to approximately the same value. The method is based on
the determination of a realization-dependent effective critical point obtained
from, e.g., a maximum susceptibility criterion. We demonstrate the method on

the error due to the approximation is O(1/d^2). Furthermore, it is possible to
improve upon this approximation by including the effects of Euclidean

Making use of the closed time-path (CTP) formalism of nonequilibrium field
theory, we write down a set of quantum Boltzmann equations describing the local
number density asymmetries of the particles involved in supersymmetric
electroweak baryogenesis. CP-violating sources manifest ``memory'' effects
which are typical of the quantum transport theory and are not present in the
classical approach. Compared to previous estimates, these non-Markovian
features enhance the final baryon asymmetry by at least two orders of
magnitude. This means that a CP-violating phase $|\sin \phi_{\mu}|$ as small as
$10^{-3}$ (or even smaller) is enough to generate the observed baryon
asymmetry.

recombination mechanisms. Parton x distributions are first calculated at Q^2=1
GeV^2 by the model, and they are evolved to larger Q^2 in order to be compared
with various F_2 data. The experimental shadowing is explained by the
parton-recombination effects. Then, the modification of sea-quark and gluon
distributions is investigated. We show x and Q^2 dependent results of the
ratios S_A/S_D and G_A/G_D. They indicate significant shadowing at small x and
large ratios in the medium-x region. Our theoretical results should be tested
by future experiments, for example, at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider).
Furthermore, our studies are important for finding a signature of the
quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion reactions. We also indicate that nuclear
effects in the deuteron should be taken into account for finding the accurate
F_2 structure function of the neutron.

moments and axial vector coupling constants) in a generalized quark model in
which the angular momentum of a polarized nucleon is partly spin $\langle S_z

represented by the rotation of a flux-tube connecting the three constituent
quarks. The best fit is obtained with $\langle S_z \rangle = 0.08\pm 0.15$,
$\langle L_z \rangle = 0.42\pm 0.14$. We now consider the consequences of this
idea for the $q^2$-dependence of the magnetic and axial vector form factors. It
is found that the isovector magnetic form factor $G_M^{\mathrm{isovec}}(q^2)$
differs in shape from the axial form factor $F_A(q^2)$ by an amount that
depends on the spatial distribution of orbital angular momentum. The model of a
rigidly rotating flux-tube leads to a relation between the magnetic, axial
vector and matter radii, $\langle r^2 \rangle_{\mathrm{mag}} =
f_{\mathrm{spin}} \langle r^2 \rangle_{\mathrm{axial}} + \frac{5}{2}

We argue that this proof suggests that there are light quarks moving in the
field of the Skyrmion. We then show that if these light degrees of freedom are
averaged out, the low energy excitations of the Skyrmion are in fact spinorial.
A natural consequence of our approach is the prediction of a $(1/2)^{-}$ state
and its excitations in addition to the nucleon and delta. Using the recent
numerical evidence for the existence of Skyrmions with discrete spatial
symmetries, we further suggest that the the low energy spectrum of many light
nuclei may possess a parity doublet structure arising from a subtle topological
interaction between the slow Skyrmion and the fast quarks. We also present
tentative experimental evidence supporting our arguments.
