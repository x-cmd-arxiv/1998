Archival ASCA X-ray data confirm this detection and locate the pulsar within 1'
of the supernova remnant N157B, 14' from SN1987A. The pulsar manifests evidence
for glitch(es) between the RXTE and ASCA observations which span 3.5 years; the
mean linear spin-down rate is Pdot = 5.126 X 10E-14 s/s. The background
subtracted pulsed emission is similar to other Crab-like pulsars with a power
law of photon index of ~ 1.6. The characteristic spin-down age (~ 5000 years)
is consistent with the previous age estimate of the SNR. The inferred B-field

discovery the spectra showed a red continuum and line velocities of the order
of 1000 \kms. The luminosity and the photospheric expansion velocity suggest
that the explosion occurred about 50 days before discovery, and that a plateau
probably followed. Model light curves and spectra of the explosion of a 26 \M\

the observations. The radius of the progenitor, constrained by the prediscovery

could be an effect of neglecting the metallicity dependence of the calibrated

the metallicity distribution of solar neighbourhood stars (Rocha-Pinto & Maciel

ASCA are presented (for a total exposure time of about 160 000 s). The analysis
and interpretation of the results is complicated by the fact that 4 of these

  The present analysis shows that, in agreement with official recommendations,
a conservative systematic error (at low energies) of about 2-3 x 10**20cm-2
must be assumed when analyzing ASCA SIS data. A soft-excess, with variable flux
and/or shape, has been clearly detected as well as flux and spectral
variability. An anti-correlation is found between the spectral index and the
flux in the 2-10 keV energy range. Fitting the data with the latest available
calibration matrices, we also detect an emission line at ~5.4-5.7 keV (~6.3-6.6
keV in the quasar frame) in (only) the two observations with lowest fluxes
where it is weak (EW ~ 20-30 eV), narrow and consistent with being produced by
Fe K emission from neutral matter.
  Overall, the observations are qualitatively consistent with a variable,
non-thermal X-ray continuum emission, i.e., a power law with Gamma~1.6
(possibly produced in the innermost regions of the radio-optical jet), plus
underlying ``Seyfert-like'' features, i.e., a soft-excess and Fe K line
emission due to a reflection component. When the continuum (jet) emission is in
a low state, the spectral features produced by the Seyfert-like spectrum
(soft-excess, iron line and possibly a steep power law plus reflection
continuum) are more easily seen.

weights of their attraction basins are distributed as in a Random Map with
reversal symmetry. The time-scale after which cycles are reached grows
exponentially with system size $N$, and the exponent vanishes in the symmetric
limit, where $T\propto N^{2/3}$. The transition can be related to the dynamics
of the infinite system (where cycles are never reached), using the closing
probabilities as a tool.
  We also study the relaxation of the function $E(t)=-1/N\sum_i |h_i(t)|$,
where $h_i$ is the local field experienced by the neuron $i$. In the symmetric
system, it plays the role of a Ljapunov function which drives the system
towards its minima through steepest descent. This interpretation survives, even
if only on the average, also for small asymmetry. This acts like an effective
temperature: the larger is the asymmetry, the faster is the relaxation of $E$,
and the higher is the asymptotic value reached. $E$ reachs very deep minima in
the fixed points of the dynamics, which are reached with vanishing probability,
and attains a larger value on the typical attractors, which are cycles of
length 2.

of a structure which moves along with the growth site. The time average of the
structure, which is defined with respect to the active spot of growth, defines
an activity-centered pattern. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the
pattern has a tail which decays slowly, as a power law. To understand this sort
of pattern formation, we write down an approximate integral equation involving
the local interface dynamics and long-ranged jumps of the growth spot. We
clarify the nature of the approximation by considering a model for which the
integral equation is exactly derivable from an extended master equation.
Improvements to the equation are considered by adding a second coupled equation
which provides a self-consistent description. The pattern, which defines a
one-point correlation function, is shown to have a strong effect on ordinary
space-fixed two-point correlation functions. Finally we present evidence that
this sort of pattern formation is not confined to the interface problem, but is
generic to situations in which the activity at succesive time steps is
correlated, as for instance in several other extremal models. We present
numerical results for activity-centered patterns in the Bak-Sneppen model of
evolution and the Zaitsev model of low-temperature creep.

unity into a spin network, but should rather change preexisting edges by $\pm$
one unit of color. Smolin has proposed a specific ansatz for a correlated
scalar constraint. This ansatz does not introduce color unity edges, but the
[scalar, scalar] commutator is shown to be anomalous. In general, it will be
hard to avoid anomalies, once correlation is introduced into the constraint;

difficult to remove. We argue that such singularities are harmless if they are
located purely in the Euclidean region. We thus obtain new singular instantons
leading to a closed universe; unlike the usual regular instantons used for this
purpose, they do not require complex initial conditions. The singularity gives
a boundary contribution to the action which is small for the instantons leading
to sufficient inflation, but changes the sign of the action for small $\phi$
corresponding to short periods of inflation.

automorphisms of M to its diffeomorphism group is not surjective on homotopy
groups. More precisely, it is not surjective on \pi_j for all odd j \leq
\max\{2m-1,2n-1\}. This is a weak higher-dimensional analogue of Gromov's
results for \C P^1 \times \C P^1. The proof uses parametrized Gromov-Witten
invariants in a new (?) way. We also give some information about the symplectic
automorphism groups of M with differently weighted product symplectic
structures.

studied. We present the integral formula which is obtained as a quasi-classical
limit of the integral formula for form factors of the SU(N) invariant Thirring
model due to F. Smirnov. A proof is given that those integrals satisfy sl_N KZ
equation of level 0. The relation of the integral formulae with the chiral
Szego kernel is clarified. As a consequence the integral formula with the
special choice of cycles is rewritten in terms of the Riemann theta functions
associated with the Z_N curve. This formula gives a generalization of Smirnov's
formula for sl_2.

method using the Skyrme interaction. In applying the BCS theory, the seniority
pairing force is employed, of which strengths are determined in order to
reproduce the empirical pairing gap formula, $\bar{\Delta} = 12 A^{-1/2}$ MeV,
through a smooth level density obtained in the Thomas-Fermi approximation.
Properties of superdeformation are investigated by calculating potential energy
surfaces (PES) for various sets of the pairing force strengths and the Skyrme
force parameter for 194Hg and 236,238U. The best results are obtained using
both the SkM* force and the pairing force strength determined in this paper. By
making use of this set of forces, a systematic calculation of SD states is
carried out extensively for even-even nuclei for 20 <= Z <= 82. From our
calculation, the barriers preventing the decay into the normally deformed
states are about twice as high as those predicted by Krieger et al., who used
the same Skyrme interaction but a pairing force stronger than ours. The
differences of the present results from the Nilsson-Strutinsky calculation are
analyzed.

Teide 2, with optical and infrared photometry which place it on the cluster
sequence slightly below the expected substellar mass limit. We have obtained
low- and high-resolution spectra that allow us to determine its spectral type
(M6), radial velocity and rotational broadening; and to detect H$_\alpha$ in
emission and Li I 670.8 nm in absorption. All the observed properties strongly
support the membership of Teide 2 into the Pleiades. This object has an
important role in defining the reappearance of lithium below the substellar
limit in the Pleiades. The age of the Pleiades very low-mass members based on
their luminosities and absence or presence of lithium is constrained to be in
the range 100--120 Myr.

joint measurement of position and momentum is investigated. In a previous paper
the problem was discussed in the context of the unbiased measurements
considered by Arthurs and Kelly. It is now shown, that suitably modified
versions of these results hold for a much larger class of simultaneous
measurements. The approach is a development of that adopted by Braginsky and
Khalili in the case of a single measurement of position only. A distinction is
made between the errors of retrodiction and the errors of prediction. Two
error-error relationships and four error-disturbance relationships are derived,
supplementing the Uncertainty Principle usually so-called. In the general case
it is necessary to take into account the range of the measuring apparatus. Both
the ideal case, of an instrument having infinite range, and the case of a real
instrument, for which the range is finite, are discussed.
