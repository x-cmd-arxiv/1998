the inter-surface forces to the concentration profiles. The numerical results
show that over-compensation of the surface charges by adsorbing
polyelectrolytes can lead to effective attraction between equally charged
surfaces. Simple scaling arguments enable us to characterize qualitatively the
inter-surface interactions as function of the fraction of charged monomers p
and the salt concentration c_b. In the low salt regime we find strong repulsion
at short distances, where the polymers are depleted from the inter-surface gap,
followed by strong attraction when the two adsorbed layers overlap. The
magnitude of this attraction scales as p^{1/2} and its dominant length scale is
proportional to a/p^{1/2}, where a is the monomer size. At larger distances the
two adsorbing surfaces interact via a weak electrostatic repulsion. For strong
polyelectrolytes at high salt concentration the polymer contribution to
attraction at short distances scales as p/c_b^{1/2} and the length scale is
proportional to kappa*a^2/p, where kappa^{-1} is the Debye-Huckel screening
length. For weak polyelectrolytes at high salt concentration the interaction is
repulsive for all surface separations and decays exponentially with a decay
length equal to kappa^{-1}. The effect of irreversible adsorption is discussed
as well and it is shown that inter-surface attraction can be obtained in this
case as well.

particular, this allows us to study the proximity effect, related to the
Andreev reflection. A new type of proximity effect emerges when the wire has
normally a tendency towards Wigner crystal formation. The latter is suppressed
by the leads below a space--dependent crossover temperature; it gets dominated
everywhere by the $2k_F$ CDW at $T<L^{3/2 (K-1)}$ for short range interactions
with parameter $K<1/3$. The lowest--order renormalization equations of a weak

perturbative expression for the conductance in the presence of a potential with

also affected by the noninteracting leads, especially for very repulsive

shortly summarize our present understanding of anomalous normal-state
properties of cuprates, and present the electronic phase diagram,
phenomenological scenarios and models proposed in this connection. The
numerical method is then described in more detail. Following sections are
devoted to various static and dynamical properties of the t-J model. Among
thermodynamic properties the chemical potential, entropy and the specific heat
are evaluated. Discussing electrical properties the emphasis is on the optical
conductivity and the d.c. resistivity. Magnetic properties involve the static
and dynamical spin structure factor, as measured via the susceptibility
measurements, the NMR relaxation and the neutron scattering, as well as the
orbital current contribution. Follows the analysis of electron spectral
functions, being studied in photoemission experiments. Finally we discuss
density fluctuations, the electronic Raman scattering and the thermoelectric
power. Whenever feasible a comparison with experimental data is performed. A
general conclusion is that the t-J model captures well the main features of
anomalous normal-state properties of cuprates, for a number of quantities the
agreement is even a quantitative one. It is shown that several dynamical
quantities exhibit at intermediate doping a novel universal behaviour
consistent with a marginal Fermi-liquid concept, which seems to emerge from a
large degeneracy of states and a frustration induced by doping the
antiferromagnet.

derived from a scattering theory of collective (neutral) spin modes by a bare
quasiparticle. We start by mapping the low lying spectrum of spin waves in the
uniform ferromagnet onto that of free moving spin excitons, and then we study
their scattering by the defect of charge. In the presence of this disturbance,
the local spin stiffness varies in space, and we translate it into an
inhomogeneus metric in the Hilbert space supporting the excitons. An attractive
potencial is then required to preserve the symmetry under global spin
rotations, and it traps the excitons around the charged defect. The
quasiparticle now carries a spin texture. Textures containing more than one
exciton are described within a mean-field theory, the interaction among the
excitons being taken into account through a new renormalization of the metric.
The number of excitons actually bound depends on the Zeeman coupling, that
plays the same role as a chemical potencial. For small Zeeman energies, the
defect binds many excitons which condensate. As the bound excitons have a unit
of angular momentum, provided by the quantum of magnetic flux left unbalanced
by the defect of charge, the resulting texture turns out to be a topological
excitation of charge 1. Its energy is that given by the non-linear sigma model
for the ground state in this topological sector, i.e. the texture is a
skyrmion.

the absorption or amplification parameter is large is also quite different from
the RPA result. We prove that the probability densities in the amplifying case
are related to those in the absorbing case with the same magnitude of the
imaginary part of the dielectric permeability by exact dual relationships. From
the analysis of the average reflectance that shows a nonmonotonic dependence on

independent of time, and admits a spacelike decomposition. In the spherically
symmetric, non-rotating case, we re-derive exact solutions for dust and perfect
fluid accretion in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, and compare with
numerical hydrodynamic integrations. We perform representative axisymmetric
computations. These demonstrations suggest that the use of those coordinate
systems carries significant improvements over the standard approach, especially
for higher dimensional studies.

model with constituant quarks and gluon. The lowest $J^P=1^-$ states may be
built in two ways, $l_g=1$ (gluon excited) corresponding to an angular momentum
between the gluon and the $c \bar c$ system, while $l_{c\bar c}=1$ (quark
excited) corresponds to an angular momentum between the $c$ and the $\bar c$.
The lowest lying hybrid $J^P=1^-$ state in the flux tube model is similar to
the $l_g=1$ in the quark-gluon model. In particular it verifies the selection
rule that it cannot decay into two fundamental mesons. The $l_{q\bar q}=1$
hybrid may decay into two fundamental mesons, but with decay widths larger than
1 GeV, which tells that they do not really exist as resonant states. Using a
chromoharmonic potential, we find no mixing between the $l_g=1$ and $l_{c\bar
c}=1$. More realistic potentials might induce a strong mixing between them,
implying that no hybrid meson exist. If, on the contrary, such a strong mixing
does not occur, we find, in agreement with the flux tube model, that only the
$l_g=1$ appears as a real resonant state. In such a case, hybrid mesons may
exist as resonances only if they are decoupled from the ground state channels,
which explains the difficulty to observe them experimentally. We reconsider
accordingly the Ono-Close-Page scenario of mixing between charmonium and
charmed-hybrid to explain the anomalies around 4.1 GeV. We find a very small
mixing between radially excited charmonium and hybrid mesons, which forbids
considering the $\psi(4.040)$ and $\psi(4.160)$ as combinations of 3S
charmonium and $l_g=1$ hybrid meson with a large mixing.
