the situation in retreating convective envelopes, which tend to retain most of
the angular momentum while becoming less massive, thereby increasing the
specific angular momentum in the convection zone and thus in the layers close
to the stellar surface. We explore the spin-up mechanism quantitatively in a
stellar evolution calculation of a rotating 12 M_sun star, which is found to be
spun up to critical rotation after leaving the red supergiant branch. We
discuss implications of this spin-up for the circumstellar matter around
several types of stars, i.e., post-AGB stars, B[e] stars, pre-main sequence

main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy, therefore described
by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass, equivalent to conservation of
heat, or the local first law; entropy is a local current; and non-destruction
of entropy, or the local second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic
energy tensor being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other
fields by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the
thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the dissipative
(thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the second law suggests
certain equations for the dissipative energy tensor, generalising the Israel-
Stewart dissipative relations, which describe heat conduction and viscosity
including relativistic effects and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic
case, the perfect-fluid model is recovered. In the linear approximation for
entropy, the Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for
entropy, the theory is similar to that of Israel & Stewart, but involving
neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation, nor
non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics, the thermal
energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic, though this is derived
in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the theory reduces in the non-

to Mueller. The dissipative energy density seems to be a new thermodynamical

new (``Laplacian'') gauge fixing prescription for implementing the Abelian
Projection of QCD. The gauge condition is based on the lowest-lying eigenvector
of the covariant Laplacian operator in the adjoint representation.
  This Laplacian gauge fixing procedure is free of the ambiguities which plague
lattice simulations which work with the popular Maximally Abelian Gauge.
Furthermore, Laplacian gauge fixed configurations enjoy a natural kind of
smoothness. These two properties are crucial for a reliable determination of
physical quantities using the Abelian Projection.
  We also examine a new, Higgs-field-like observable which emerges as a
by-product of the method. This quantity can be used to identify magnetic
monopoles in a way independent of the traditional prescription. It is argued
that physically relevant magnetic monopoles are accomodated well by the
Laplacian method, while they are suppressed (too) strongly in Maximally Abelian
Gauge.
  Finally, first evidence of abelian dominance in the Laplacian Abelian
Projection is presented.

charginos, neutralinos, and sleptons receive corrections which grow like log
m_squark for large m_squark. In this paper we calculate the chargino pair
production cross section at e+e- colliders with quark/squark loop corrections.
We introduce a novel formulation, where the one-loop amplitude is reorganized
into two parts. One part is expressed in terms of the ``effective'' chargino
coupling gbar and mixing matrices U^P, V^P, and includes all O(log m_squark)
corrections, while the other decouples for large m_squark. The form of the
one-loop cross section then becomes physically transparent. Our formulation can
be easily extended to other loops and processes. Numerically, we find
significant corrections due to the effective t-channel coupling gbar, for
gaugino-like charginos. In the mixed region, where the chargino has large
gaugino and Higgsino components, the corrections due to (U^P,V^P) are also
significant. Our numerical results disagree with a previous calculation. We
revisit previous studies of the determination of gbar through the measurement
of the chargino production cross section. We point out that a previous study,
which claimed that the measurement suffers large systematic errors, was
performed at a ``pessimistic'' point in MSSM parameter space. We provide
reasons why the systematic errors are not a limiting factor for generic
parameter choices.

  Frequency","13 pages, including 5 figures, 21 bibliographic references",,,,"quant-ph",,"  An explicit solution of the equation for the classical harmonic oscillator
with smooth switching of the frequency has been found . A detailed analysis of
a quantum harmonic oscillator with such frequency has been done on the base of
the method of linear invariants. It has been shown that such oscillator
possesses cofluctuant states, different from widely studied Glauber's coherent
and ""ideal"" squeezed states.
