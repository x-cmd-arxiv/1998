These consist of a few hundred low-mass binary and single stars, and have
half-mass radii in the range 2.5 to 0.08 pc. The primordial binary-star
population has a period distribution similar to that observed in Taurus-Auriga

different from that obtained at the North-East (NE) limb. The emission lines
from Si and S were quite strong while those of O and the continuum emission
were similar to those obtained at the NE limb. Based on the spectral analysis,
Si and S emission lines originated from a high-kTe and low ionization plasma
whereas O and most of the continuum emission arose from a low-kTe and high
ionization plasma. We suppose that Si and S emitting gas are present at the
interior of the Loop while O lines and continuum emission mainly arise from the
shell region. Therefore, we subtracted the spectrum of the NE limb from that of
the center. Obtained abundances of Si, S, and Fe were 4 $\pm$ 1, 6 $\pm$ 2, and
${1.3}^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$ times higher than those of the cosmic abundances,
respectively, and are $\sim$40 times richer than those obtained at the NE limb.
These facts strongly support that some of the crude ejecta must be left at the

suggests a type II SN with a massive progenitor star as the origin of the

Parameters in the model are fixed from experimental measurements near 900 deg C
under the assumption that there is local mass transport through surface
diffusion and that step motion is limited by the attachment rate of adatoms to
step edges. The direct heating current is treated as an external driving force
acting on each adatom. Numerical calculations show both qualitative and
quantitative agreement with experiment. A force in the step down direction will
destabilize the uniform step train towards step bunching. The average size of
the step bunches grows with electromigration time as t^beta, with beta = 0.5,
in agreement with experiment and with an analytical treatment of the steady
states. The model is extended to include the effect of direct hopping of
adatoms between different terraces. Monte-Carlo simulations of a solid-on-solid
model, using physically motivated assumptions about the dynamics of surface
diffusion and attachment at step edges, are carried out to study two
dimensional features that are left out of the present step model and to test
its validity. These simulations give much better agreement with experiment than
previous work. We find a new step bending instability when the driving force is
along the step edge direction. This instability causes the formation of step
bunches and antisteps that is similar to that observed in experiment.

generally, Hopf algebras whose coradical is a Hopf subalgebra. Given such a
Hopf algebra A, consider its coradical filtration and the associated graded
coalgebra grad(A). Then grad(A) is a graded Hopf algebra, since the coradical
A_0 of A is a Hopf subalgebra. In addition, there is a projection \pi: grad(A)
\to A_0; let R be the algebra of coinvariants of \pi. Then, by a result of
Radford and Majid, R is a braided Hopf algebra and grad(A) is the bosonization
(or biproduct) of R and A_0: grad(A) is isomorphic to (R # A_0). The principle
we propose to study A is first to study R, then to transfer the information to
grad(A) via bosonization, and finally to lift to A. In this article, we apply
this principle to the situation when R is the simplest braided Hopf algebra: a
quantum linear space. As consequences of our technique, we obtain the
classification of pointed Hopf algebras of order p^3 (p an odd prime) over an
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero; with the same hypothesis,
the characterization of the pointed Hopf algebras whose coradical is abelian
and has index p or p^2; and an infinite family of pointed, non-isomorphic, Hopf
algebras of the same dimension. This last result gives a negative answer to a

Lie group SU(2) is given by an integral formula over copies of SU(2). For the
graph determined by a 4-simplex this gives the evaluation as an integral over a
space of geometries for a 4-simplex.

range have been obtained from measurements of the $pp\to pK^+\Lambda$ reaction
close to the production threshold by comparing model phase-space Dalitz plot
occupations with experimental ones. The data fix well the position of the
virtual bound state in the $\Lambda p$ system. Combining this with information
from elastic $\Lambda p$ scattering measurements at slightly higher energies,
together with the fact that the hyperdeuteron is not bound, leads to a new
determination of the low energy $\Lambda p$ scattering parameters.

systems is presented. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of atomic
spectra by periodic orbit-type theories. For diamagnetic non-hydrogenic Rydberg
atoms, the dynamical explanation for observed spectral features has been
disputed. By building on our previous work on the photoabsorption spectrum, we
show how, by the addition of diffractive terms, the spectral fluctuations in
the energy level spectrum of general Rydberg atoms can be obtained with
remarkable precision from the Gutzwiller trace formula. This provides further
evidence that non-hydrogenic systems are most naturally described in terms of
diffraction rather than classical chaos.

after the elimination of internal degrees of freedom. If the system is composed
of a hierarchy of scales, the reduction procedure could be worked repeatedly
and the characterization of this iterating method is carried out. Namely, a
prescription describing a discrete hierarchy of master equations for the
density operator is obtained. Decoherence follows from the irreversible
coupling of the systems, defined by mesoscopic variables, to internal degrees
of freedom. We discuss briefly the existence of systems with the same dynamics
laws at different scales. We made an explicit calculation for an ensemble of
particles with internal harmonic interaction in an external anharmonic field.
New conditions related to the semiclassical limit for mesoscopic systems
(Wigner-function) are conjectured.
