orbits can be traced back in time from a knowledge of their current positions,
via a variational principle. We modify this variational principle so that
galaxy redshifts can be input instead of distances, thereby recovering the
distances. As a test problem, we apply the new method to a Local Group model.
We infer M = 4 to 8 x 10^{12} M_sun depending on cosmology, implying that the
dynamics of the outlying Local Group dwarves are consistent with the timing
argument. Some algorithmic issues need to be addressed before the method can be
applied to recover nonlinear evolution from large redshift surveys, but there

We review the general problem of mass measurement in radio pulsar binaries, and
critically discuss all current estimates of the masses of radio pulsars and
their companions. We find that significant constraints exist on the masses of
twenty-one radio pulsars, and on five neutron star companions of radio pulsars.
All the measurements are consistent with a remarkably narrow underlying
gaussian mass distribution, m = 1.35 +- 0.04 solar masses. There is no evidence
that extensive mass accretion (delta m >~ 0.1 solar mass) has occurred in these

binaries are consistent with a random distribution, and thus find no evidence
for either alignment or counteralignment of millisecond pulsar magnetic fields.

the accretion-powered emission are thought to be produced by gas orbiting very
close to the neutron star, whereas the 360-600 Hz brightness oscillations seen
during thermonuclear X-ray bursts are produced by one or two hot spots rotating
with the star and have frequencies equal to the stellar spin frequency or its
first overtone. The oscillations constrain the masses and radii of these

the QCD partition function. For eigenvalues near zero this energy scale shows a
weak volume dependence that is not consistent with $E_c \sim 1/L^2$ which might
be expected from the pion Compton wavelength and from the behavior of the
Thouless energy in mesoscopic systems. However, the numerical value of $E_c$
for our largest volumes is in rough agreement with estimates from the pion
Compton wavelength. A scaling behaviour consistent with $E_c\sim 1/L^2$ is
found in the bulk of the spectrum. For $\delta E> E_c$ the number variance
shows a linear dependence with a slope which is larger than the nonzero
multifractality index of the wave functions. Finally, the average spectral
density and the scalar susceptibilities are discussed in the context of

physics residual effects possibly described by the $dim=6$ operators
${\O}_{GG}$ and ${\widetilde\O}_{GG}$ which induce anomalous $Hgg$ and $Hggg$
couplings. Two ways for constraining these operators at LHC may be ~useful. The
first is based on the total Higgs boson production rate induced by gluon-gluon
fusion, in which the main cause of limitations are due to theoretical
uncertainties leading to sensitivities of $|d_G|\simeq 3.\times 10^{-4}$ and
$|\widetilde{d}_G|\simeq 1.4\times 10^{-3}$ for the corresponding anomalous
couplings, in the mass range $100 GeV \lsim \mh \lsim 2~00 GeV$. These results
imply sensitivity to new physics scales of 51 and 24 TeV respectively. The
second way investigated here concerns the shape of the Higgs transverse
momentum; for which the theoretical uncertainties are less severe and the
limitations are mainly induced by statistics. A simple analysis, based on the
ratio of the number of events at large and low $p_T$ at LHC, leads to similar
sensitivities, if only the $H\to \gamma \gamma $ decay mode is used. But the
sensitivities can now be improved by a factor 2 to 10, depending on the Higgs
mass, if the Higgs decay modes to $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, $WW$, $ZZ$ are also used.

The dynamical equation for the pions is consistent with that for the nucleons

model which describes the hadronic matter with $N$, $\Delta$ and $\pi$ degrees
of freedom simultaneously. Within this approach, we investigate the medium
effects on the pion dispersion relation as well as the pion absorption and pion
production channels in cold nuclear matter. In contrast to the results of the
non-relativistic model, the pion dispersion relation becomes harder at low
momenta and softer at high momenta as compared to the free one, which is mainly
caused by the relativistic kinetics. The theoretically predicted free $\pi N
