  0957+561","12 pages including 1 PostScript figure",,"10.1086/306322","CfA-TA98-144","astro-ph",,"  Radio observations establish the B/A magnification ratio of gravitational
lens 0957+561 at about 0.75. Yet, for more than 15 years, the optical
magnfication ratio has been between 0.9 and 1.12. The accepted explanation is
microlensing of the optical source. However, this explanation is mildly
discordant with (i) the relative constancy of the optical ratio, and (ii)
recent data indicating possible non-achromaticity in the ratio. To study these
issues, we develop a statistical formalism for separately measuring, in a
unified manner, the magnification ratio of the fluctuating and constant parts
of the light curve. Applying the formalism to the published data of Kundi\'c et
al. (1997), we find that the magnification ratios of fluctuating parts in both
the g and r colors agrees with the magnification ratio of the constant part in
g-band, and tends to disagree with the r-band value. One explanation could be
about 0.1 mag of consistently unsubtracted r light from the lensing galaxy G1,
which seems unlikely. Another could be that 0957+561 is approaching a caustic
in the microlensing pattern.

velocities of 100-1000 km/s, and they are inferred to have initial dipole
magnetic fields of 10^{11}-10^{13}. The average space velocity of a normal star
in the Milky Way is only 30 km/s, which means that pulsars must receive a
substantial 'kick' at birth. Here we propose that the birth characteristics of
pulsars have a simple physical connection with each other. Magnetic fields
maintained by differential rotation between the core and envelope of the
progenitor would keep the whole star in a state of approximately uniform
rotation until 10 years before the explosion. Such a slowly rotating core has
1000 times less angular momentum than required to explain the rotation of
pulsars. Although the specific physical process that 'kicks' the neutron star
at birth has not been identified, unless its force is exerted exactly head-on,
it will also cause the neutron star to rotate. We identify this process as the
origin of the spin of pulsars. Such kicks will cause a correlation between the
velocity and spin vectors of pulsars. We predict that many neutron stars are
born with periods longer than 2 s, and never become radio pulsars.

nuclei (AGN). We define these to be AGN for which the direct line-of-sight to
the continuum source is obscured by Compton-thick material. The aim is to
construct, for the first time, a model consistent with X-ray line luminosities,
line ratios and various luminosity indicators. The ASCA spectra of six such
sources show several X-ray lines that can be reliably measured, mostly due to
highly ionized magnesium, silicon sulphur and iron. These enable us to
investigate the physical conditions of the scattering material. The sources
show evidence of He-like and H-like iron lines that are likely to be produced
in hot (T approx 10^6 K) photoionized gas. By measuring the EW of the lines,
and by constructing a diagnostic line-ratio diagram, we demonstrate that the
silicon and magnesium lines are produced by the same gas emitting the highly
ionized iron lines. The properties of this gas are rather different from the
properties of warm absorbers in type I AGN. Neutral 6.4 keV iron lines are also
detected, originating in a different component which can be either Compton-thin
or Compton-thick. The best measured iron lines suggest an enhancement of
n_{Fe}/n_H by a factor approx 2 compared to solar, in both the hot and cool
Compton-thin components. We further show that in four of the sources, the Fe
Kalpha(6.4keV)/Hbeta (lambda 4861Ang) line ratio is consistent with that
predicted for typical narrow line region clouds, and the reddening corrected
Hbeta is known, provided the column density is larger than approx
10^{22.5}/cm^2, alpha_{ox} is smaller than 1.3. For some sources, this is a
viable alternative to the commonly assumed Compton thick medium as the origin
of the 6.4 keV iron line.

characteristics which identify them as arising predominantly from properties of
the oscillations in the vicinity of the solar surface: in the super-adiabatic,
convective boundary layer and above. These frequency differences may therefore
provide useful information about the structure of these regions, precisely
where the theory of solar structure is most uncertain.
  In the present work we use numerical simulations of the outer part of the Sun
to quantify the influence of turbulent convection on solar oscillation
frequencies. Separating the influence into effects on the mean model and
effects on the physics of the modes, we find that the main model effects are
due to the turbulent pressure that provides additional support against gravity,
and thermal differences between average 3-D models and 1-D models. Surfaces of
constant pressure in the visible photosphere are elevated by about 150 km,
relative to a standard envelope model.
  As a result, the turning points of high-frequency modes are raised, while
those of the low-frequency modes remain essentially unaffected. The
corresponding gradual lowering of the mode frequencies accounts for most of the
frequency difference between observations and standard solar models. Additional
effects are expected to come primarily from changes in the physics of the
modes, in particular from the modulation of the turbulent pressure by the
oscillations.

The principal lens galaxy is an elliptical galaxy with normal structural
properties, lying close to the fundamental plane for its redshift. (2) The
potential of the main lens galaxy is nearly round, even when not constrained by
the small ellipticity of the light of this galaxy. (3) All models involving two
mass distributions place the group component near the luminosity-weighted
centroid of the brightest nearby group members. (4) All models predict a time
delay ratio r_{ABC} = 1.3. (5) Our lens models predict H_0 = 44 +/- 4 km/s/Mpc

= 65 +/- 5 km/s/Mpc if it has a constant mass-to-light ratio. (6) Any dark halo
of the main lens galaxy must be truncated near 1.5 arcsec (4 h^{-1} kpc) before
the inferred Ho rises above 60 km/s/Mpc. (7) The quasar host galaxy is lensed
into an Einstein ring connecting the four quasar images, whose shape is
reproduced by the models. Improved NICMOS imaging of the ring could be used to

independent of the gas temperature profile, we find that the ellipticities of
the PSPC isophotes exceed those predicted if M propto L at a marginal
significance level of 85% (80%) for oblate (prolate) symmetry. Detailed
hydrostatic models of an isothermal gas yield ellipticities for the gravitating

ellipticity of the R-band optical light, <e_R> = 0.30 (e_R^max=0.39).

steeper profiles if the gas is essentially isothermal (which is suggested by
the PSPC spectrum) and the surface brightness in the central regions (r<~15"")
is not modified substantially by a multi-phase cooling flow, magnetic fields,
or discrete sources. We argue that these effects are unlikely to be important

In particular the second order correlation function is diagonal in the shell

shells. Spurious oscillations in the scaling regime, which are an annoying
feature of the GOY model, are eliminated by our choice of nonlinear coupling.
We demonstrate that the model exhibits multi-scaling similarly to these GOY
model. The scaling exponents are shown to be independent of the viscous
mechanism as is expected for Navier-Stokes turbulence and other shell models.
These properties of the new model make it optimal for further attempts to
achieve understanding of multi-scaling in nonlinear dynamics.

assumed that the states S=0 have a degeneracy p (p=1 corresponds to the usual
BEG model). In some materials, the transition would be better described by a
disordered DBEG model; further, the inclusion of disorder in the DBEG model may
be relevant in the study of shape memory alloys. From the theoretical point of
view, it would be interesting to study the consequence of conflicting effects:
the parameter p, which increases the first-order phase-transition region, and
disorder in the crystal field, which tends to diminish this region in three
dimensions. In order to study this competition in high-dimensional systems, we
apply a mean-field approximation: it is then possible to determine the critical

configurations consist of alternating stripes of spiral phases of opposite

predicts an instability of the (C) phase. This suggests that the state is

A method is presented whereby the imaginary part of $G^{(1)}$ may be calculated
for a charged scalar field in a static spherically symmetric spacetime with
arbitrary curvature coupling and a classical electromagnetic field $A^{\mu}$.
The calculations are performed in Euclidean space where the Hadamard Elementary
function and the Euclidean Green function are related by $(1/2)G^{(1)}=G_{E}$.
This method uses a $4^{th}$ order WKB approximation for the Euclideanized mode
functions for the quantum field. The mode sums and integrals that appear in the
vacuum expectation values may be evaluated analytically by taking the large
mass limit of the quantum field. This results in an asymptotic expansion for
$G^{(1)}$ in inverse powers of the mass $m$ of the quantum field.
Renormalization is achieved by subtracting off the terms in the expansion
proportional to nonnegative powers of $m$, leaving a finite remainder known as
the ``DeWitt-Schwinger approximation.'' The DeWitt-Schwinger approximation for
$G^{(1)}$ presented here has terms proportional to both $m^{-1}$ and $m^{-2}$.
The term proportional to $m^{-2}$ will be shown to be identical to the
expression obtained from the $m^{-2}$ term in the generalized DeWitt-Schwinger
point-splitting expansion for $G^{(1)}$. The new information obtained with the
present method is the DeWitt-Schwinger approximation for the imaginary part of
$G^{(1)}$, which is proportional to $m^{-1}$ in the DeWitt-Schwinger
approximation for $G^{(1)}$ derived in this paper.

this particle number can be identified with the single particle distribution

effective source term for the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. By analyzing the
evolution of the particle number we exhibit the time structure of the particle
creation process in a constant electric field, and derive the local form of the

creation rate, the source term requires an asymptotic expansion which is
uniform in time, and whose longitudinal momentum dependence can be approximated
by a delta function only on long time scales. The local Vlasov source term
amounts to a kind of Markov limit of field theory, where information about
quantum phase correlations in the created pairs is ignored and a reversible
Hamiltonian evolution is replaced by an irreversible kinetic one. This
replacement has a precise counterpart in the density matrix description, where
it corresponds to disregarding the rapidly varying off-diagonal terms in the
adiabatic number basis and treating the more slowly varying diagonal elements
as the probabilities of creating pairs in a stochastic process. A numerical
comparison between the quantum and local kinetic approaches to the dynamical

We show that colliding with a magnetized white dwarf, the axionic boson stars
dissipate their energies and heat the white dwarf. Consequently the white dwarf
cooled sufficiently can emit detectable amount of radiations with the
collision. Using a recent evaluation of the population of the white dwarfs as
candidates of MACHOs, we estimate the event rate of the collisions and obtain a
result that the rate is large to be detectable.

and the features and shortcomings of the most commonly used ansatzes are
discussed. In particular, the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics
(UrQMD) transport model is described in great detail. Based on the same
principles as QMD and RQMD, it incorporates a vastly extended collision term
with full baryon-antibaryon symmetry, 55 baryon and 32 meson species. Isospin
is explicitly treated for all hadrons. The range of applicability stretches
from $E_{lab}< 100$ MeV/nucleon up to $E_{lab}> 200$ GeV/nucleon, allowing for
a consistent calculation of excitation functions from the intermediate energy
domain up to ultrarelativistic energies. The main physics topics under
discussion are stopping, particle production and collective flow.

with identity. The algebras of this class are called self-conjugated, and they
include, for instance, the paragrassmann algebras of order $p$, the
quaternionic algebra and the toroidal algebras. We study the relation between
derivations and integration, proving a generalization of the standard result
for the Riemann integral about the translational invariance of the measure and
the vanishing of the integral of a total derivative (for convenient boundary
conditions). We consider also the possibility, given the integration over an
algebra, to define from it the integral over a subalgebra, in a way similar to
the usual integration over manifolds. That is projecting out the submanifold in
the integration measure. We prove that this is possible for paragrassmann
algebras of order $p$, once we consider them as subalgebras of the algebra of
the $(p+1)\times(p+1)$ matrices. We find also that the integration over the
subalgebra coincides with the integral defined in the direct way. As a
by-product we can define the integration over a one-dimensional Grassmann
algebra as a trace over $2\times 2$ matrices.

coordinate transformation. The metric tensor of the Lagrangian coordinates
couples the dynamical system theory rigorously into the solution of this class
of partial differential equations. If the flow has chaotic streamlines, the
diffusion will dominate the solution at a critical time, which scales
logarithmically with the diffusivity. The subsequent rapid diffusive relaxation
is completed on the order of a few Lyapunov times, and it becomes more
anisotropic the smaller the diffusivity. The local Lyapunov time of the flow is
the inverse of the finite time Lyapunov exponent. A finite time Lyapunov
exponent can be expressed in terms of two convergence functions which are
responsible for the spatio-temporal complexity of both the advective and
diffusive transports. This complexity gives a new class of diffusion barrier in
the chaotic region and a fractal-like behavior in both space and time. In an
integrable flow with shear, there also exist fast and slow diffusion. But
unlike that in a chaotic flow, a large gradient of the scalar field across the
KAM surfaces can be maintained since the fast diffusion in an integrable flow
is strictly confined within the KAM surfaces.

fruitful.
