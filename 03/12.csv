galaxies, 3C324 (z=1.206) and 3C368 (z=1.132), which are both prime examples of
the radio-optical alignment effect seen in powerful radio galaxies with
redshifts z > 0.6. Radio observations were made using the Very Large Array in
A-array configuration at 5 and 8 GHz, and using the MERLIN array at 1.4 and
1.65 GHz. Radio spectral index, radio polarisation, and rotation measure maps
are presented for both sources. Radio core candidates are detected in each
source, and by aligning these with the centroid of the infrared emission the
radio and the optical/infrared images can be related astrometrically with 0.1
arcsec accuracy. In each source the radio core is located at a minimum of the
optical emission, probably associated with a central dust lane. Both sources
also exhibit radio jets which lie along the directions of the bright strings of
optical knots seen in high resolution Hubble Space Telescope images. The
northern arm of 3C368 shows a close correlation between the radio and optical
emission, whilst along the jet direction of 3C324 the bright radio and optical
knots are co-linear but not co-spatial. These indicate that interactions
between the radio jet and its environment play a key role in producing the
excess ultraviolet emission of these sources, but that the detailed mechanisms
vary from source to source. 3C368 is strongly depolarised and has an average
rest-frame rotation measure of a few hundred rad/m^2, reaching about 1000
rad/m^2 close to the most depolarised regions. 3C324 has weaker depolarisation,
and an average rest-frame rotation measure of between 100 and 200 rad/m^2. Both
sources show large gradients in their rotation measure structures, with
variations of up to 1000 rad/m^2 over distances of about 10 kpc.

  No evidence is found to support the contention that converting gas into stars

cooling rate within those objects where stars have already formed. In practice,
because cold gas can be reheated by shocks but stars remain as such whatever
happens the masses of the largest objects found in the star forming runs are

distributions, we derive the distributions of velocities for low-mass Pleiades
members. Comparison of the rotational distributions of low-mass members between
IC 2602/2391 and the Pleiades suggests that G dwarfs behave like solid-bodies
and follow Skumanich's law during this time span. However, comparison between
Pleiades and older clusters (M34 and Hyades) indicates that the braking of slow
rotators on the early main sequence is weaker than predicted by an asymptotical
Skumanich's law. This strongly supports the view that angular momentum tapped
in the radiative core of slow rotators on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS)
resurfaces into the convective envelope between Pleiades and Hyades age. For
the G-dwarfs, we derive a characteristic coupling time scale between the core
and the envelope of about 100--200Myr. The relationship between rotation and
coronal activity in the Pleiades is in agreement with previous observations in
other clusters and field stars. We show that the Rossby diagram provides an
excellent description of the X-ray activity for all stars in the mass domain

distribution clearly reveals the presence of a number of old Globular Clusters
(GCs) from the parent galaxies. Their effective radii do not significantly
differ from those of the young star cluster population. We confirm Meurer's
(1995) conjecture that the shape of the LF changes in the course of evolution
if age spread effects are accounted for. We find that over a Hubble time the
observed exponential LF of the young star clusters will evolve into a typical
Gaussian GCLF with parameters M$_{V_0} = -7.1$ mag and $\sigma (M_{V_0}) = 1.3$
mag. We discuss the influence of metallicity, the effects of an inhomogeneous
internal dust distribution, as well as the possible influence of internal --
through stellar mass loss -- and external dynamical effects on the secular
evolution of the LF. Referring YSC luminosities to a uniform age and combining
with model M/L, we recover the intrinsic mass distribution of the YSC system.
It is Gaussian in shape to good approximation thus representing a
quasi-equilibrium distribution that $-$ according to Vesperini's (1997)
dynamical modelling for the Milky Way GC system $-$ will not be altered in
shape over a Hubble time of dynamical evolution, allthough a substantial number
of clusters will be destroyed. Comparing young star cluster populations in an

counts can be made similar if the number of large scale sources at 2 GHz is
divided by 250, and their flux densities increase by a factor of 10. On the
scenario that all GPS sources evolve into large scale radio sources, these
results show that the lifetime of a typical GPS source is ~250 times shorter
than a typical large scale radio source, and that the source luminosity must
decrease by a factor of ~10 in evolving from GPS to large scale radio source.
However, we note that the redshift distributions of GPS and large scale radio
sources are different and that this hampers a direct and straightforward
interpretation of the source counts. Further modeling of radio source evolution
combined with cosmological evolution of the radio luminosity function for large

with the impurity spin completely screened. For $f>\mu$ the impurity is

depends on the N and f: for $N\le f$ the specific heat and the susceptibility
are dominated by the NFL contributions, for N>f the leading contributions are

decay $B \to X_d + \gamma$ (and its charge conjugate) in NLO QCD, including
leading power corrections in $1/m_b^2$ and $1/m_c^2$ in the standard model. The
average branching ratio of the decay $B \to X_d\gamma$ and its charge conjugate
is estimated to be in the range $6.0 \times 10^{-6} \leq <BR(B \to X_d \gamma)>
\leq 2.6 \times 10^{-5}$, obtained by varying the CKM-Wolfenstein parameters
$\rho$ and $\eta$ in the range $-0.1 \leq \rho \leq 0.4$ and $0.2 \leq \eta
\leq 0.46$ and taking into account other parametric dependence. In the stated
range of the CKM parameters, we find the ratio $R(d\gamma/s\gamma) = <BR(B \to
X_d\gamma)>/<BR(B \to X_s\gamma)>$ to lie in the range between 0.017 and 0.074.
Theoretical uncertainties in this ratio are found to be small. Hence, this
ratio is well suited to provide independent constraints on the CKM parameters.
The CP-asymmetry in the $B \to X_d \gamma$ decay rates is found to be in the
range $(7 - 35)%$. Both the decay rates and CP asymmetry are measurable in
forthcoming experiments at $B$ factories and possibly at HERA-B.

rely on either supersymmetry or technicolor. In this framework, the
gravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which we
take as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature. The observed
weakness of gravity on distances $\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n
\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The
Planck scale $M_{Pl} \sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity
is simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While
gravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the
Standard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of
weak scale ""thickness"" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number
of striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments. For the case of
$n=2$ new dimensions, planned sub-millimeter measurements of gravity may
observe the transition from $1/r^2 \to 1/r^4$ Newtonian gravitation. For any
number of new dimensions, the LHC and NLC could observe strong quantum
gravitational interactions. Furthermore, SM particles can be kicked off our 4
dimensional manifold into the new dimensions, carrying away energy, and leading
to an abrupt decrease in events with high transverse momentum $p_T \gsim$ TeV.
For certain compact manifolds, such particles will keep circling in the extra
dimensions, periodically returning, colliding with and depositing energy to our
four dimensional vacuum with frequencies of $ \sim 10^{12}$ Hz or larger. As a
concrete illustration, we construct a model with SM fields localised on the
4-dimensional throat of a vortex in 6 dimensions, with a Pati-Salam gauge
symmetry $SU(4) \times SU(2) \times SU(2)$ in the bulk.

the former mixing can be responsible for oscillations of solar neutrinos, while
the latter for those of atmospheric neutrinos. It is mentioned in a footnote
that $\nu_s$ is one of two sterile neutrinos, possible from a viewpoint of an

They survey the author's attempts to find and understand canonical
probabilistic entities in a local field (e.g. p-adic) setting. We propose
answers to the related questions: ``What are the analogues for Gaussian
measures?'' and ``What are the analogues for Brownian motion and its
multiparameter relatives?''
  There is a suitable concept of orthogonality in the local field setting, and
one can mimic a classical abstract definition of Euclidean Gaussian measures.
The resulting theory is, in some sense, an L^\infty rather than an L^2 one; and
so although there are many similarities to the Euclidean case there are also
some striking differences.
  Local field Brownian motion is the most natural local field Gaussian process
that takes values in a local field vector space and is indexed by another local
field vector space. Characterising the polar sets for such processes lead us to
study the notion of additive functionals or homogeneous random measures and a
related Riesz-like potential theory.
  We study local times, show they can be recovered by counterparts of classical
intrinsic contstructions using dilation and Hausdorff measures, and establish

  We finish with a discussion of random series with local field Gaussian
coefficients. Although we show that there are broad classes of random series
which are stationary, we also find that there is no obvious counterpart of the
representation of a general stationary Gaussian process on the circle as a
random Fourier series.

associative algebras called down-up algebras. We show that down-up algebras
exhibit many of the important features of the universal enveloping algebra
$U(\fsl)$ of the Lie algebra $\fsl$ including a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt type
basis and a well-behaved representation theory. We investigate the structure

highest weight representations, and category $\mathcal O$ modules for them. We
calculate the exact expressions for all the weights, since that information has
proven to be particularly useful in determining structural results about

determined with the ALADIN magnetic spectrometer at SIS. An analysis of
kinematic correlations between the two and three heaviest projectile fragments
in their rest frame was performed. The sensitivity of these correlations to the
conditions at breakup was verified within the schematic SOS-model. The data
were compared to calculations with statistical multifragmentation models and to
classical three-body calculations. Classical trajectory calculations reproduce
the dynamical observables. The deduced breakup parameters, however, differ
considerably from those assumed in the statistical multifragmentation models
which describe the charge correlations. If, on the other hand, the analysis of
kinematic and charge correlations is performed for events with two and three
heavy fragments produced by statistical multifragmentation codes, a good
agreement with the data is found with the exception that the fluctuation widths
of the intrinsic fragment energies are significantly underestimated. A new
version of the multifragmentation code MCFRAG was therefore used to investigate
the potential role of angular momentum at the breakup stage. If a mean angular
momentum of 0.75$\hbar$/nucleon is added to the system, the energy fluctuations
can be reproduced, but at the same time the charge partitions are modified and
deviate from the data.

based chronometer to study the confinement of the iron group cosmic rays
requires knowledge of the corresponding halflife, but its measurement is
impossible at the present time. However, the branching ratio for the related
beta+ decay of 54Mn was determined recently. We use the shell model with only a
minimal truncation and calculate both beta+ and beta- decay rates of 54Mn. Good
agreement for the beta+ branch suggests that the calculated partial halflife of
the beta- decay, (4.94 \pm 0.06) x 10^5 years, should be reliable. However,
this halflife is noticeably shorter than the range 1-2 x 10^6 y indicated by
the fit based on the 54Mn abundance in cosmic rays. We also evaluate other
known unique second forbidden beta decays from the nuclear p and sd shells
(10Be, 22Na, and two decay branches of 26Al) and show that the shell model can
describe them with reasonable accuracy as well.

is not compatible with the reduction postulate, even when decoherence is taken
into account. The violation of the causal evolution, introduced by the standard
reduction postulate distinguishes certain systems (as the measurement devices),
whose states are very close to statistical mixtures (as the ones resulting from
the process of decoherence). In these systems, this violation has not any
observable effect. In arbitrary quantum systems, the transition from the
initial density matrix to a diagonal matrix predicted by the standard reduction
postulate, would lead to a complete breakdown of the Schr\""odinger evolution,
and consequently would destroy all the predictive power of quantum mechanics.
What we show here, is that there is a modified version of the postulate that
allows to treat all the quantum mechanical systems on equal footing. The
standard reduction postulate may be considered as a good approximation, useful
for practical purposes, of this modified version which is consistent with the
Schr\""odinger evolution and via decoherence with the experimental results.
Within this approach, the physical role played by the reduction postulate is as
a tool for the computation of relative probabilities and consequently for the
determination of the probabilities of consistent histories.

second system whose dynamical coordinate is slowly-varying is generalized to
allow for stochastic evolution of the slow system. The stochastic behavior is
produced by coupling the slow system to a heat resevoir which is modeled by a
bath of harmonic oscillators initially in equilibrium at temperature T, and
whose spectral density has a bandwidth which is small compared to the
energy-level spacing of the fast system. The well-known energy-level shifts
produced by Berry's phase in the fast system, in conjunction with the
stochastic motion of the slow system, leads to a broadening of the fast system
energy-levels. In the limit of strong damping and sufficiently low temperature,
we determine the degree of level-broadening analytically, and show that the
slow system dynamics satisfies a Langevin equation in which Lorentz-like and
electric-like forces appear as a consequence of geometrical effects. We also
determine the average energy-level shift produced in the fast system by this
mechanism.

a priori a ""charged particle"", since it is endowed with a Coulomb field plus
the field of a magnetic dipole. The rest energy of the soliton is finite, and
the angular momentum stored in its electromagnetic field can be identified
--for suitable choices of the parameters-- with the spin of the charged
particle. Thus this approach seems to yield a classical model for the charged
