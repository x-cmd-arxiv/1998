gravitational lensing; (1) the bending angle, (2) the lensing statistics and
(3) the time delay. In order to take account of the inhomogeneities, the
Dyer-Roeder distance is used, which includes a parameter representing the
clumpiness of the matter along the line of sight. It is shown analytically that
all three combinations of distances appearing in the above observations (1)-(3)
are monotonic with respect to the clumpiness in general, for any given set of
the density parameter, cosmological constant and redshifts of the lens and the
source. Some implications of this result for the observation are presented; the
clumpiness decreases both the bending angle and the lensing event rate, while
it increases the time delay. We also discuss cosmological tests using the
gravitational lensing in the clumpy universe.

years one of the most elusive mysteries in High Energy-Astrophysics. The main
problem regarding the nature of GRBs has usually been the lack of knowledge of
their distance scale. About 300 GRBs are detected annually by BATSE in the full
sky, but only a few of them can be localized accurately to less than half a
degree. For many years, follow-up observations by other satellites and
ground-based telescopes were conducted, but no counterparts at other
wavelengths were found. The breakthrough took place in 1997, thanks to the
observation by BeppoSAX and RossiXTE of the fading X-ray emission that follows
the more energetic gamma-ray photons once the GRB event has ended. This
emission (the afterglow) extends at longer wavelengths, and the good accuracy
in the position determination by BeppoSAX has led to the discovery of the first
optical counterparts -for GRB 970228, GRB 970508, and GRB 971214-, greatly
improving our understanding of these puzzling sources. Now it is widely
accepted that most bursts originate at cosmological distances but the final
solution of the GRB problem is still far away.

spectrograph on the KeckI telescope have been analyzed to characterize the
evolution of the metagalactic ionizing flux near a redshift of 3. The evolution
of SiIV/CIV has been determined using three different techniques: using total
column densities of absorption line complexes, as in Songaila & Cowie (1996);
using the column densities of individual Voigt profile components within
complexes; and using direct optical depth ratios. All three methods show that
SiIV/CIV changes abruptly at a redshift near 3, requiring a jump in value of
about a factor of 3.4, and indicating a significant change in the ionizing
spectrum that occurs rapidly between z = 2.9 and z = 3, just above the redshift
at which Reimers et al. (1997) detected patchy HeII Lyman alpha absorption. At
lower redshifts, the ionization balance is consistent with a pure power law
ionizing spectrum but at higher redshifts the spectrum must be very soft, with
a large break at the He+ edge. An optical depth ratio technique is used to
measure the abundances of ions whose transitions lie within the forest and
CIII, SiIII and OVI are detected in this way. The presence of a significant
amount of OVI at z > 3 suggests either a considerable volume of HeIII bubbles
embedded in the more general region where the ionizing flux is heavily broken,
or the addition of collisional ionization to the simple photoionization models.

forming galaxies in the redshift range 3 to 6 with the 10 m Keck II Telescope.
These searches yield a substantial population of objects with only a single
strong (equivalent width >> 100 Angstrom) emission line, lying in the 4000 -
10,000 Angstrom range. Spectra of the objects found in narrowband-selected
samples at lambda ~5390 Angstroms and ~6741 Angstroms show that these very high
equivalent width emission lines are generally redshifted Lyman alpha 1216
Angstrom at z~3.4 and 4.5. The density of these emitters above the 5 sigma
detection limit of 1.5 e-17 ergs/cm^2/s is roughly 15,000 per square degree per
unit redshift interval at both z~3.4 and 4.5. A complementary deeper (1 sigma
\~1.0 e-18 ergs/cm^2/s) slit spectroscopic search covering a wide redshift
range but a more limited spatial area (200 square arcminutes) shows such
objects can be found over the redshift range 3 to 6, with the currently highest
redshift detected being at z=5.64. The Lyman alpha flux distribution can be
used to estimate a minimum star formation rate in the absence of reddening of
roughly 0.01 solar masses/Mpc^3/year (H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc and q_0 = 0.5).
Corrections for reddening are likely to be no larger than a factor of two,
since observed equivalent widths are close to the maximum values obtainable
from ionization by a massive star population. Within the still significant
uncertainties, the star formation rate from the Lyman alpha-selected sample is
comparable to that of the color-break-selected samples at z~3, but may
represent an increasing fraction of the total rates at higher redshifts. This
higher-z population can be readily studied with large ground-based telescopes.

invalidated! Our conclusion is in perfect agreement with Einstein's intuitive
idea that a Sch. like surface can not occur in reality. Further as singularity
is approached R ->0, in order that 2GM/R <= 1, we must have M ->0! Harrison, et
al. had also pointed out that collapse should come to a decisive end with M=0.
This is possible in GTR if the fluid radiates its entire original mass-energy

Differences in their rotational histories which could induce different rates of

available mixing mechanisms. Observations of similar stars without companions
are required to asses the potential effects of the planetary companion on the
observed depletion. It has been recently claimed that rho 1 Cnc appears to be a
subgiant. If this were the case, the observed strong Li and Be depletions could

the system out of chaos. We say a chaotic attractor is robust if, for its

periodic attractor and the chaotic attractor is unique in that neighborhood. In
this paper we show that robust chaos can occur in piecewise smooth systems and
obtain the conditions of its occurrence. We illustrate this phenomenon with a

completely carried by its $s$-valence quark. A comparison with the recent ALEPH
data and the results of earlier calculations based on the static quark model in

useful information to the question of which picture is more suitable in
describing the spin effects in the fragmentation processes.

to the extent that they are relevant to characterize the universality class of

crossed product $R\times_\alpha G$ is the vector space of $R$-valued functions
with finite support in $G$, together with the twisted convolution product given
by $$(\xi \eta)(p) = \sum_{q \in G} \xi(q) \alpha_q (\eta (q^{-1}p))$$ where
$p\in G$. This construction has been extended to the theory of Hopf algebras.
Given an action of a Hopf algebra $A$ on an algebra $R$, it is possible to make
the tensor product $R\ot A$ into an algebra by using a twisted product,
involving the action. In this case, the algebra is called the smash product and
denoted by $R# A$. In the group case, the action $\alpha$ of $G$ on $R$ yields
an action of the group algebra $\Bbb C G$ as a Hopf algebra on $R$ and the
crossed $R\times_\alpha G$ coincides with the smash product $R# \Bbb C G$. In
this paper we extend the theory of actions of Hopf algebras to actions of
multiplier Hopf algebras. We also construct the smash product and we obtain
results very similar as in the original situation for Hopf algebras. The main
result in the paper is a duality theorem for such actions. We consider dual
pairs of multiplier Hopf algebras to formulate this duality theorem. We prove a
result in the case of an algebraic quantum group and its dual. The more general
case is only stated and will be proven in a separate paper on coactions. These
duality theorems for actions are substantial generalizations of the
corresponding theorem for Hopf algebras. Also the techniques that are used here
to prove this result are slightly different and simpler.

communication between two users. Unfortunately, a widely accepted proof of its
security in the presence of source, device and channel noises has been missing.
This long-standing problem is solved here by showing that, given fault-tolerant
quantum computers, quantum key distribution over an arbitrarily long distance
of a realistic noisy channel can be made unconditionally secure. The proof is
reduced from a noisy quantum scheme to a noiseless quantum scheme and then from
a noiseless quantum scheme to a noiseless classical scheme, which can then be
tackled by classical probability theory.

"quant-ph/9803007","Chau Hoi Fung","M. Ardehali, H. F. Chau and Hoi-Kwong Lo","Efficient Quantum Key Distribution","Minor revisions for clarification. One author dropped",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We devise a simple modification that essentially doubles the efficiency of a
well-known quantum key distribution scheme proposed by Bennett and Brassard
(BB84). Our scheme assigns significantly different probabilities for the
different polarization bases during both transmission and reception to reduce
the fraction of discarded data. The actual probabilities used in the scheme are
announced in public. As the number of transmitted signals increases, the
efficiency of our scheme can be made to approach 100%. An eavesdropper may try
to break such a scheme by eavesdropping mainly along the predominant basis. To
defeat such an attack, we perform a refined analysis of accepted data: Instead
of lumping all the accepted data together to estimate a single error rate, we
separate the accepted data into various subsets according to the basis employed
and estimate an error rate for each subset {\it individually}.
