that \lya forest absorbers with N_HI > 10^{14.5} have [C/H]~=-2.5, for the UV
background spectrum of Haardt & Madau (HM). Lower column density absorption
arises in lower density gas, where OVI is the most sensitive metal tracer.
Since OVI lines lie at wavelengths contaminated by Lyman series absorption, we
interpret our Q1422 results by comparing to artificial spectra drawn from an
SPH simulation of a Lambda-dominated CDM model. A search for deep, narrow
features in Q1422 yields only a few candidate OVI lines, statistically
consistent with the number in artificial spectra with no metals; spectra
generated with the HM background and [O/H] >= -2.5 predict too many narrow
lines. However, applying the optical depth ratio technique of Songaila (1998),
we DO find significant OVI associated with CIV systems; matching Q1422 requires
[O/C]~=+0.5, implying [O/H]~=-2.0. Taken together these results imply that (a)
the metallicity in the low density IGM is at least a factor of three below that
in the overdense regions where CIV absorption is detectable, and (b) oxygen is
overabundant in these regions, consistent with the enrichment pattern of old
halo stars. If the UV background is heavily truncated above 4 Ry, an
implausibly high oxygen overabundance ([O/C]>+2) is required by the data; thus
a majority of the volume of the universe must have undergone helium

provide a new fully radiative extreme relativistic solution which is different

temporal database systems, that are intended to store and manipulate in a

  We present a framework for constructing natural language interfaces for

theories, temporal logics, and temporal databases. The framework consists of a
temporal intermediate representation language, called TOP, an HPSG grammar that
maps a wide range of questions involving temporal mechanisms to appropriate TOP

TSQL2 being a recently proposed temporal extension of the SQL database

possible if the substrate roughness, quantified by the substrate surface area,

These results are expressed in terms of a lower bound on the wetting potential

lower bound has the following properties: A minimum is present at zero or very
small separation between the two interfaces, as characteristic for the
non-wetting situation in the flat case. Most importantly, the wetting potential
needs to have a pronounced maximum at a separation comparable to the amplitude
of the substrate roughness. These findings are in agreement with the

surfactant monolayer interacts with a semi-dilute polymer solution solubilized
in the water subphase. The phase diagrams of the mixed surfactant/polymer
system are investigated within the framework of mean field theory. The polymer
enhances the fluctuations of the monolayer and induces an upward shift of the
critical temperature. The critical concentration is increased if the monomers
are more attracted (or at least less repelled) by the surfactant molecules than
by the bare water/air interface. In the case where the monomers are repelled by
the bare interface but attracted by the surfactant molecules (or vice versa),
the phase diagram may have a triple point. The location of the polymer special

provides an upper bound on the quantum capacity of the Pauli channel with
probabilities $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$. The capacity is shown to be vanishing if
$(\sqrt{p_x},\sqrt{p_y},\sqrt{p_z})$ lies outside an ellipsoid whose pole
coincides with the depolarizing channel that underlies the universal cloning
machine.

confined between two conducting plates is analysed. The Casimir energy is shown
to decline exponentially with temperature while the Casimir entropy which is
defined in the text is shown to approach a limit which depends only on the
geometry of the constraining plates. The results are discussed in terms of the
relation between the Bose distribution function and the equipartition theorem -
a relation based on a study by Einstein and Stern circa 1913.
