  Disk around Active Galactic Nuclei","11 pages, 3 figures; accepted for Publications of the Astronomical
  Society of Japan",,"10.1093/pasj/50.1.31",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent hard X-ray spectroscopy of active galactic nuclei has strongly
suggested that double-peaked, very broad Fe K emission arises from an accretion
disk around the central engine. Model fitting of the observed Fe K emission
line profile makes it possible to estimate a probable inclination angle of the
accretion disk. In order to study the geometrical relationship between the
accretion disk and broad emission-line regions (BLRs), we investigate the
correlation between the inclination angle of the accretion disk and the
velocity width of BLRs for 18 type-1 Seyfert galaxies. We found that there may
be a negative correlation between them, i.e., Seyfert nuclei with a more
face-on accretion disk tend to have larger BLR velocity widths, suggesting that
the BLRs are not coplanar with respect to the accretion disk. The most probable
interpretation may be that the BLRs arise from outer parts ({\it r} $\sim$ 0.01
pc) of a warped accretion disk illuminated by the central engine.

Galaxy with published spectra from the Infrared Space Observatory, we analyze
flux ratios between the major mid-IR emission features (EFs) centered around
6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3 microns, respectively. In a flux ratio-to-flux ratio
plot of EF(6.2)/EF(7.7) as a function of EF(11.3)/EF(7.7), the sample sources
form roughly a $\Lambda$-shaped locus which appear to trace, on an overall
basis, the hardness of a local heating radiation field. But some driving
parameters other than the radiation field may also be required for a full
interpretation of this trend. On the other hand, the flux ratio of
EF(8.6)/EF(7.7) shows little variation over the sample sources, except for two
HII regions which have much higher values for this ratio due to an ``EF(8.6\um)
anomaly,'' a phenomenon clearly associated with environments of an intense
far-UV radiation field. If further confirmed on a larger database, these trends
should provide crucial information on how the EF carriers collectively respond
to a changing environment.

summer 1994 have been interpreted as permanent superhumps. From simple
calculations based on the Tidal-Disk Instability model of Osaki, and assuming
that the accretion disc is the dominant optical source in the binary system, we
predict that the nova will evolve to become an SU UMa system as its brightness
declines from its present luminosity by another 2-3 magnitudes. Linear
extrapolation of its current rate of fading (in magnitude units) puts the time
of this phase transition within the next 2-4 years. Alternatively, the
brightness decline will stop before the nova reaches that level, and the system
will continue to show permanent superhumps in its light curve. It will then be
similar to two other old novae, V603 Aql and CP Pup, that still display the
permanent superhumps phenomenon 79 and 55 years, respectively, after their
eruptions. We suggest that non-magnetic novae with short orbital periods could
be progenitors of permanent superhump systems.

patterns of the nearest neighbour coupling: commensurate, incommensurate with
sinusoidal modulation and incommensurate with solitonic modulation. We focus on
the order of the phase transition from the commensurate dimerized phase (D) to
the incommensurate phase (I). It is shown that the order of the phase
transition depends sensitively on the model. For the solitonic model in
particular, a $k$-dependent elastic energy modifies the order of the
transition. Furthermore, we calculate gaps in the incommensurate phase in
adiabatic approximation.

theory was recently derived by showing that it is U-dual to the

method to count the microstates of the latter. This is valid even for the
non-extremal case, unlike the derivation which relies on D-brane techniques. In
this letter, I shall exploit the U-duality that exists between the
five-dimensional black hole and the two-dimensional charged black hole of
McGuigan, Nappi and Yost, to microscopically compute the entropy of the latter.
It is shown that this result agrees with previous calculations using
thermodynamic arguments.

claim that there could be different mixtures corresponding to the same density
matrix is critically examined. These results provide a new meaning to the
density matrix, which gives it the same ontological status as the wavefunction
describing a pure state. This also enables quantum entropy to be associated
with a single system.
