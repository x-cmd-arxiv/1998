  Accepted for publication in A&A main journal",,,,"astro-ph",,"  With the new generation of instruments for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
observations aiming at an accuracy level of a few percent in the measurement of
the angular power spectrum of the anisotropies, the study of the contributions
due to secondary effects has gained impetus. Furthermore, a reinvestigation of
the main secondary effects is crucial in order to predict and quantify their
effects on the CMB and the errors that they induce in the measurements. In this
paper, we investigate the contribution, to the CMB, of secondary anisotropies
induced by the transverse motions of clusters of galaxies. This effect is
similar to the Kaiser-Stebbins effect. In order to address this problem, we
model the gravitational potential well of an individual structure using the
Navarro, Frenk & White profile. We generalise the effect of one structure to a
population of objects predicted using the Press-Schechter formalism. We
simulate maps of these secondary fluctuations, compute the angular power
spectrum and derive the average contributions for three cosmological models. We
then investigate a simple method to separate this new contribution from the
primary anisotropies and from the main secondary effect, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
kinetic effect from the lensing clusters.

This distribution provides a good fit to the evolved, counts-in-cells
distribution measured in numerical simulations of hierarchical clustering from
Poisson initial conditions. This new derivation can be used to construct a
useful analytic model of the evolution of clustering measured in these
simulations. The model is consistent with the assumption that, as the universe
expands and the comoving sizes of regions change as a result of gravitational
instability, the number of such expanding and contracting regions is conserved.
The model neglects the influence of external tides on the evolution of such
regions. Indeed, in the context of this model, the GPD can be thought of as
arising from a simple variant of the well-studied spherical collapse model, in
which tidal effects are also neglected. The model can be understood as a simple
generalization of the excursion set model which is used to estimate the number
density of collapsed, virialized halos. The generalization allows one to
describe the spatial distribution of the halos and the mass simultaneously, so
the extent to which these halos are biased tracers of the underlying matter
distribution is easy to estimate.

exciting phenomenon which is quantified in electron, X-ray and neutron
scattering experiments. It is discussed in many excellent reviews and books, as
well as in the multitude of original research papers.
  This relatively short review of the subject does not attempt to discuss all
aspects of the problem of local correlations in alloys. In particular, we will
not touch such issues as multiatom (cluster) interactions, static displacements
and vibrations of alloy atoms, partially ordered, multicomponent or amorphous
alloys. As a result, we will concentrate on the Hamiltonian traditional for the
considered problem, that of the Ising model on a rigid ideal lattice with pair,
but otherwise arbitrary (i.e., of any range) interatomic interactions.
  The central object of the paper is the pair correlation function of the
corresponding dynamical variables of the model, the occupation numbers or spin
variables, the Fourier transform of which is proportional to the intensity of
diffuse scattering caused by atomic short-range order. The main aim is to show
that the expression for this quantity has certain internal structure analogous,
e.g., to that of the averaged Green's function used in the electronic theory of
disordered alloys. This structure is independent of the approximation used for
the quantitative description of correlations. As will be seen, this structure
alone, without further specification of a particular theory of short-range
order, allows us to see new possibilities in diffuse scattering, some of which
have recently been observed experimentally.

bias (HE) observed in ferromagnetic/compensated antiferromagnetic (FM/AF)

coupling polarizes the AF spins close to the interface, which spin
configuration persists after the sample is cooled below the Neel temperature.
This pins the FM spins as in Bean's model and gives rise to a negative HE. When
the cooling field increases, it eventually dominates and polarizes the AF spins
in an opposite direction to the low field one. This results in a positive HE.
The size of HE and the crossover cooling field are estimated. We explain why HE
is mostly positive for an AF single crystal, and discuss the role of interface
roughness on the magnitude of HE, and the quantum aspect of the interface
coupling.

growth, such that its late stage evolution resembles a phase separation
process. This parallel is rigorous in one dimension, if the conserved surface
current is derivable from a free energy. We study the problem in presence of a
physically relevant term breaking the up-down symmetry of the surface and which
can not be derived from a free energy. Following the treatment introduced by
Kawasaki and Ohta [Physica 116A, 573 (1982)] for the symmetric case, we are
able to translate the problem of the surface evolution into a problem of
nonlinear dynamics of kinks (domain walls). Because of the break of symmetry,
two different classes ($A$ and $B$) of kinks appear and their analytical form
is derived. The effect of the adding term is to shrink a kink $A$ and to widen
the neighbouring kink $B$, in such a way that the product of their widths keeps
constant. Concerning the dynamics, this implies that kinks $A$ move much faster
than kinks $B$. Since the kink profiles approach exponentially the asymptotical
values, the time dependence of the average distance $L(t)$ between kinks does
not change: $L(t)\sim\ln t$ in absence of noise, and $L(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ in
presence of (shot) noise. However, the cross-over time between the first and
the second regime may increase even of some orders of magnitude. Finally, our
results show that kinks $A$ may be so narrow that their width is comparable to
the lattice constant: in this case, they indeed represent a discontinuity of
the surface slope, that is an angular point, and a different approach to
coarsening should be used.

existence of null infinities. Further introducing the concept of a non-naked

thin dust shell as a source is considered. The shell Hamiltonian constraint is
written and the corresponding Schroedinger equation is obtained. This equation
appeared to be a finite differences equation. Its solutions are required to be
analytic functions on the relevant Riemannian surface. The method of finding
discrete spectra is suggested based on the analytic properties of the
solutions. The large black hole approximation is considered and the discrete
spectra for bound states of quantum black holes and wormholes are found. They
depend on two quantum numbers and are, in fact, quasi-continuous. The quantum
black hole bound state depends not only on mass but also on an additional
quantum number, and black holes with the same mass have different quantum
hairs. These hairs exhibit themselves at the Planckian distances near the black
hole horizon. For the observer who can not measure the distances smaller than
the Planckian length the black hole has the only parameter, its mass. The
other, non-measurable, parameter leads to the quantum corrections to the black
hole entropy. The quantum states with given mass are the mixed ones. It is
shown that there exists the ground quantum black hole state with minimal mass
equal approximately the Planckian mass. Its quantum state has zero entropy and
it is a pure state. The existence of the quantum hairs may solve (at least
partially) the well known information paradox in the black hole physics.

background corresponding to the SL(2,R) WZWN model. This background is locally
anti-de Sitter spacetime with non-vanishing torsion. Conformal invariance is
expressed as the torsion being parallelized. The precise effect of the
conformal invariance on the dynamics of both circular and generic classical
strings is extracted. In particular, the conformal invariance gives rise to a
repulsive interaction of the string with the background which precisely cancels
the dominant attractive term arising from gravity. We perform both
semi-classical and canonical string-quantization, in order to see the effect of
the conformal invariance of the background on the string mass spectrum. Both
approaches yield that the high-mass states are governed by m sim HN (N,`large
integer'), where m is the string mass and H is the Hubble constant. It follows
that the level spacing grows proportionally to N: d(m^2 alpha')/dN sim N, while
the entropy goes like: S sim sqrt{m}. Moreover, it follows that there is no
Hagedorn temperature,so that the partition function is well defined at any
positive temperature. All results are compared with the analogue results in
Anti- de Sitter spacetime, which is a non conformal invariant background.
Conformal invariance simplifies the mathematics of the problem but the physics
remains mainly unchanged. Differences between conformal and non-conformal
backgrounds only appear in the intermediate region of the string spectrum, but
these differences are minor. For low and high masses, the string mass spectra
in conformal and non-conformal backgrounds are identical. Interestingly enough,
conformal invariance fixes the value of the spacetime curvature to be -69/(26
alpha').

speaking: L-supported rays are strongly distinguishable in topology while
L-negligible rays have very mild geometry.
  Each L-supported ray R defines hyperplane in H^2(X,R) on which Lefschetz
duality degenerates so it is a cohomology ring invariant. The hyperplane
carries a multiplicity (cohomology ring invariant) which is related to the
geometry of the ray R. The number of L-supported rays is bounded.
  Although the number of L-negligible rays may be infinite and they are
invisible in the cohomology ring, their geometry is easier than that of
L-supported rays. They are classifieable in low dimensions. Each L-negligible
ray contains lots of ``good'' rational curves whose deformation is of expected
dimension. In effect, L-negligible rays are invariant under deformations of
complex structure and can be used to compute Gromov-Witten invariants in
symplectic geometry.
