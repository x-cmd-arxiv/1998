of such central black holes is available in the form of extremely dense gas
clouds within the broad emission-line region (BLR) on the scale of $\sim

homogeneously observed (and processed) sets of lobe-dominated radio-loud
quasars, taken from literature, we show that a positive correlation exists
between the radio sizes of the quasars and the widths of their broad $H\beta$
emission lines, and this correlation is found to be significantly stronger than
the other well known correlations involving radio size. This statistical
correlation is shown to be consistent with the largest (and, hence, very
possibly the oldest) radio sources harboring typically an order-of-magnitude
more massive central engines, as compared to the physically smaller and, hence,
probably much younger radio sources. This inference is basically in accord with

recently been discovered in the optical spectra of at least two supersoft X-ray
sources (SSSs), RX J0513-069 and RX J0019.8+2156, and tentatively also in one
short-period cataclysmic variable star (CV), the recurrent nova T Pyx. These
features are thought to provide evidence for the presence of highly collimated
jets in these systems. No similar spectral signatures have been detected in the
spectra of other short-period CVs. Here, we ask if this apparent absence of
``jet lines'' in the spectra of most CVs already implies the absence of jets of
the kind that appear to be present in the SSSs and perhaps T Pyx, or whether
the current lack of jet detections in CVs can still be ascribed to
observational difficulties.
  To answer this question, we derive a simple, approximate scaling relation
between the expected equivalent widths (EWs) of the jet lines in both types of
systems and the accretion rate through the disk. We then use this relation to
predict the strength of jet lines in the spectra of ``ordinary'' CVs, i.e.
systems characterized by somewhat lower accretion rates than T Pyx. Making the
assumption that the features seen in T Pyx are indeed jet lines and using this
system as a reference point, we find that if jets are present in many CVs, they
may be expected to produce satellite recombination lines with EWs of a few
hundredths to a few tenths of Angstroms in suitably selected systems. A similar
prediction is obtained if the SSS RX J0513-069 is used as a reference point.
Such EWs are small enough to account for the non-detection of jet features in
CVs to date, but large enough to allow them to be detected in data of
sufficiently high quality, if they exist.

span broad ranges in metallicity, bolometric luminosity, and galaxy properties.
The projected size of the IUE spectroscopic aperture is typically one to
several kpc and therefore usually encompasses the entire starburst and is
similar to the aperture-sizes used for spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies.
Our principal conclusion is that local starbursts occupy a very small
fractional volume in the multi-dimensional manifold defined by such fundamental
parameters as the extinction, metallicity, and vacuum-UV line strengths (both
stellar and interstellar) of the starburst and the rotation speed (mass) and
absolute magnitude of the starburst's `host' galaxy. More metal-rich starbursts
are redder and more heavily extinguished in the UV, more luminous, have
stronger vacuum-UV lines, and occur in more massive and optically-brighter host
galaxies. The results on local starbursts suggest that the high-redshift `Lyman
Drop-Out' galaxies are typically highly reddened and extinguished by dust
(average factor of 5 to 10 in the UV), may have moderately high metallicities
(0.1 to 1 times solar?), are probably building galaxies with stellar surface-
mass-densities similar to present-day ellipticals, and may be suffering
substantial losses of metal-enriched gas that can `pollute' the IGM.

seismicity predicted by this model is much greater than would be predicted from
simple elasto-dynamic interactions. We present a systematic procedure to test
for the accelerating seismicity predicted by the critical point model and to
identify the region approaching criticality, based on a comparison between the
observed cumulative energy (Benioff strain) release and the power-law behavior
predicted by theory. This method is used to find the critical region before all

spurious patterns generated by our procedure in purely random catalogs, is
rejected with 99.5% confidence. An empirical relation between the logarithm of
the critical region radius (R) and the magnitude of the final event (M) is

formulation has a confining phase (exhibiting area law of the Wilson loop) in
the strong coupling region above a critical coupling $g_c$. This result is
obtained by taking into account topological non-trivial sectors in U(1) gauge
theory. The derivation is based on the reformulation of gauge theory as a
deformation of a topological quantum field theory and subsequent dimensional
reduction of the D-dimensional topological quantum field theory to the
(D-2)-dimensional nonlinear sigma model. The topological quantum field theory
part of the four-dimensional U(1) gauge theory is exactly equivalent to the
two-dimensional O(2) nonlinear sigma model. The confining (resp. Coulomb) phase
of U(1) gauge theory corresponds to the high (resp. low) temperature phase of
O(2) nonlinear sigma model and the critical point $g_c$ is determined by the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition temperature. The quark
(charge) confinement in the strong coupling phase is caused by the vortex
condensation. Thus the continuum gauge theory has the direct correspondence to
the compact formulation of lattice gauge theory.

cosmological constant problem (CCP). The theory is based on the requirement
that the measure of integration in the action is not necessarily $\sqrt{-g}$
but it is determined dynamically through additional degrees of freedom.
Realization of these ideas in the framework of the first order formalism solves
the CCP. Incorporation of a condensate of a four index field strength allows,
after a conformal transformation to the Einstein frame, to represent the system
of gravity and matter in the standard GR form. Now, however, the effective
potential vanishes at a vacuum state due to the exact balance to zero of the
gauge fields condensate and the original scalar fields potential. As a result
it is possible to combine the solution of the CCP with: a) inflation and
transition to a $\Lambda =0$ phase without fine tuning after a reheating
period; b) spontaneously broken gauge unified theories (including fermions).
The model opens new possibilities for a solution of the hierarchy problem.
