within 1.8 days during 1996 October 27-29, consistent with coming from the same
location on the sky. We assess the evidence that these events may be due to a
series of bursts from a single source by calculating the probability that such
a clustering in position and in time of occurrence might happen by chance. The
calculation of this probability is afflicted by the usual problem of a
posteriori statistics. We introduce a clustering statistic, which is formed
from the ""minimum circle radius"" (i.e. the radius of the smallest circle that
just encloses the positions of all the events) and the minimum time lapse (i.e.
the time elapsed between the first and last event). We also introduce a second
clustering statistic, which is formed from the ""cluster likelihood function""
and the minimum time lapse. We show that the use of these statistics largely
eliminates the ""a posteriori"" nature of the problem. The two statistics yield
significances of the clustering of $3.3\times 10^{-4}$ and $3.1\times 10^{-5}$,
respectively, if we interpret the four events as four bursts, whereas the
clustering is not significant if we interpret the four events as only three
bursts. However, in the latter case one of the bursts is the longest ever
observed by BATSE.

  Burst Symposium",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The IRAS 100 micron image of the GRB 970228 field shows that the amount of
galactic dust in this direction is substantial and varies on arcminute angular
scales. From an analysis of the observed surface density of galaxies in the
$2.6' \times 2.6'$ HST WFPC image of the GRB 970228 field, we find $A_V = 1.1
\pm 0.10$. From an analysis of the observed spectra of three stars in the GRB
970228 field, we find $A_V = 1.71^{+0.20}_{-0.40}$. This value may represent
the best estimate of the extinction in the direction of GRB 970228, since these
three stars lie only $2.7''$, $16''$, and $42''$ away from the optical
transient. If instead we combine the two results, we obtain a conservative
value $A_V = 1.3 \pm 0.2$. This value is significantly larger than the values
$A_V = 0.4 - 0.8$ used in papers to date. The value of $A_V$ that we find
implies that, if the extended source in the burst error circle is extragalactic
and therefore lies beyond the dust in our own galaxy, its optical spectrum is
very blue: its observed color $(V-I_c)_{obs} \approx 0.65^{+0.74}_{-0.94}$ is
consistent only with a starburst galaxy, an irregular galaxy at $z > 1.5$, or a
spiral galaxy at $z > 2$. On the other hand, its observed color and surface
brightness $\mu_V \approx 24.5$ arcsec$^{-2}$ are similar to those expected for
the reflected light from a dust cloud in our own galaxy, if the cloud lies in
front of most of the dust in this direction.

the literature distance modulus and reddening, the CMD samples stars more
massive than 4 Mo, corresponding to a look-back time of 0.15 Gyr approximately.
The data are compared to synthetic CMDs to derive the recent star formation
history in NGC 1569. It is found that the observed field has experienced a
global burst of star formation (SF) lasting at least 0.1 Gyr, and ended a few
Myr ago. During the burst, the SF rate was approximately constant, and, if
quiescent periods occurred, they lasted less than 10 Myr. The level of the SF
rate was very high: 0.5 Mo/yr for a Salpeter IMF, in stars with mass ranging
from 0.1 to 120 Mo. When scaled for the surveyed area, the SF rate is
approximately 100 times larger than found in the most active dwarf irregulars
in the Local Group. The data are consistent with a Salpeter IMF, or slightly
steeper exponents. We discuss the implications of our results in the general
context of the evolution of dwarf galaxies.

truncation in the Levy distribution to the (truncation in the Pareto Power Law

total wealth invested in the stock. In the cases where the system is dominated
by the largest traders, the dynamics looks similar to noisy low-dimensional
chaos. By introducing traders memory and/or feedback between individual and
collective wealth fluctuations (the later identified with the stock returns),
one obtains clustered ""volatility"" as well as market booms and crashes. The
basic feedback loop consists in: - computing the market price of the stock as
the sum of the individual wealths invested in the stock by the traders and -
determining the time variation of the individual trader wealth as his/her

For evaluating the prompt muon contribution to the muon flux, we apply two
phenomenological approaches to the charm production problem: the recombination
quark-parton model and the quark-gluon string model. To solve the muon
transport equation at large depths of homogeneous medium, a semi-analytical
method is used. The simple fitting formulas describing our numerical results

particles which interact through short and (or) long range interactions by
means of a simple analytic spin model. The thermodynamic properties of the
system are worked out in the framework of the grand canonical ensemble. It is
shown that the system experiences a phase transition at fixed average density
in the thermodynamic limit. The phase diagram and the caloric curve are
constructed and compared with numerical simulations. The implications of our
results concerning the caloric curve are discussed in connection with the
interpretation of corresponding experimental data.

reacting with a target. The reaction between one of the particles and the
target as well as the corresponding pairwise final state interactions are
carefully treated. Both absorption and diffraction processes are included.
Detailed differential and total cross sections are calculated for two-neutron
(2n) removal from 6He by fragmentation on 12C. Effects due to the core
shadowing are taken into account. Good agreement with available experimental
data is obtained.

emission of electrons moving close to a periodic structure, is treated as the
resonant diffraction radiation. Simple formulas have been designed for the SPR
intensity for a grating having perfectly conducting strips spaced by a vacuum
gap. The results have been compared with those obtained via other techniques.
It has been shown that the intensity of radiation for the said gratings for a
relativistic case sufficiently exceeds the SPR intensity for the grating made
up by a periodically deformed continuous surface.

have observed that its motion looks different from that of a classical top. A
classical top rotates about its own axis which precesses around a vertical
fixed external axis. The hovering magnetic top, on the other hand, has its axis
slightly tilted and moves rigidly as a whole about the vertical axis. We call
this motion synchronous, because in a stroboscopic experiment we see that a
point at the rim of the top moves synchronously with the top axis. We show that
the synchronous motion may be attributed to a small deviation of the magnetic
moment from the symmetry axis of the top. We calculate the minimum angular
velocity required for stability in terms of the moments of inertia and magnetic
field and show that it is different from that of a classical top. We also give
experimental results that were taken with a top whose moment of inertia can be
changed. These results show very good agreement with our calculations.
