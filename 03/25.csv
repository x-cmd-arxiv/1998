evolution with 1-D hydrodynamics to follow in detail the evolution and radial
behaviour of gas and stars during the formation of elliptical galaxies. We use
the model to explore the links between the evolution and formation of
elliptical galaxies and QSO activity. The knowledge of the radial gas flows in
the galaxy allows us to trace metallicity gradients, and, in particular, the
formation of a high-metallicity core in ellipticals. The high-metallicity core
is formed soon enough to explain the metal abundances inferred in high-redshift
quasars. The star formation rate and the subsequent feedback regulate the
episodes of wind, outflow, and cooling flow, thus affecting the recycling of
the gas and the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The evolution
of the galaxy shows several stages, some of which are characterized by a
complex flow pattern, with inflow in some regions and outflow in other regions.
All models, however, exhibit during their late evolution a galactic wind at the
outer boundary and, during their early evolution, an inflow towards the galaxy
nucleus. The inner inflow evolution could explain the bolometric luminosity of
a quasar lodged at the galaxy centre as well as the evolution of the QSO
luminosity function.

"cond-mat/9803299","Frau Schuppe","Prof. Dr. Peter Fulde","Solids with weak and strong electron correlations","LATEX, 33 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cond-mat",,"  A number of methods are discussed which may serve for a treatment of electron
correlations in solids. When the electron correlations are relatively weak like
in semiconductors or a number of ionic crystals one may start from a
self-consistent field calculation and include correlations by quantum chemical
methods. An incremental computational scheme enables us to obtain results of
high quality for the ground state of those systems. A number of examples
demonstrates that explicitely.
  Solids with strongly correlated electrons require the use of model
Hamiltonians. With their help one can tackle the problem of determining
spectral densities for those systems. The projection technique is a useful tool
here. In strongly correlated $f$ electron systems electron or holes can
crystallize with quite different physical consequences as in the case of a
Wigner crystal or Verwey transition. Finally, different routes to heavy-fermion
behavior are discussed, another hallmark of strongly correlated electrons.

range of nonlinearity is obtained where the dynamics is different. In low and

is applied to the specific instance of charged beam dynamics in particle
accelerators. The resulting picture is that the collective beam dynamics, at
the leading semiclassical order in Planck constant can be described by a
particular diffusion process, the Nelson process, which is time-reversal
invariant. Its diffusion coefficient $\sqrt{N}\lambda_{c}$ represents a
semiclassical unit of emittance (here $N$ is the number of particles in the
beam, and $\lambda_{c}$ is the Compton wavelength). The stochastic dynamics of
the Nelson type can be easily recast in the form of a Schroedinger equation,
with the semiclassical unit of emittance replacing Planck constant. Therefore
we provide a physical foundation to the several quantum-like models of beam
dynamics proposed in recent years. We also briefly touch upon applications of
the Nelson and Schroedinger formalisms to incorporate the description of
collective coherent effects.
