surrounding fields which lie in the outer parts of the LMC disk. Ages are
determined by means of the magnitude difference between the giant branch clump
and the turnoff, while metallicities are derived from the location of the giant
and subgiant branches as compared to fiducial star clusters. We find that in
most cases the stellar population of each star cluster is quite similar to that
of the field where it is embedded. Three particular fields present remarkable
properties: (i) The so far unique cluster ESO121-SC03 at ~9 Gyr has a
surrounding field which shares the same properties. (ii) The field surrounding
the far eastern intermediate age cluster OHSC37 is noteworthy in the sense that
we do not detect any evidence of LMC stars. (iii) The fields of SL388 and SL509
present CMDs with a secondary clump ~0.45 mag fainter than the dominant
intermediate age clump, suggesting a stellar population component located
behind the LMC disk at a distance comparable to that of the SMC. The mean
metallicity derived for the intermediate age outer disk clusters is
<[Fe/H]>=-0.7 and for their surrounding fields <[Fe/H]>=-0.6. These values are
significantly lower than found by Olszewski et al. (1991, AJ, 101, 515) for a
sample of clusters of similar age, but are in good agreement with several
recent studies. A few clusters stand out in the age--metallicity relation in
the sense that they are intermediate age clusters at relatively low metallicity
([Fe/H]~-1).

well as the narrow one (FWHM $\simeq 68$ km s$^{-1}$). The off-nuclear CO
spectra also show the single-peaked broad component (FWHM $\simeq$ 100 km

dispersion of $\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. If this gas disk would be extended up to
a few kpc in radius, we may explain the wide line widths of the off-nuclear CO
emission. Alternatively, we may attribute the off-nuclear CO emission to the
gas associated with the superwind. However, if all the CO gas moves along the
biconical surface of the superwind, the CO spectra would show double-peaked
profiles. Hence, the single-peaked CO profiles of the off-nuclear regions may
be explained by an idea that the morphology and/or velocity field of the

the standard interpretation of the velocity operator in the Dirac equation
theory (and agree with the solution proposed by Hestenes, on the basis
--however-- of ad-hoc assumptions that are unnecessary in the present
approach). The above results appear to support the conjecture that the
Zitterbewegung motion (a helical motion, at the classical limit) is responsible
for the electron spin.

scattering length in highly asymmetric traps. We find that in these traps the
Bose--Einstein condensates behave like quasiparticles and do not expand when
the trapping in one direction is eliminated. The results can be applicable to
the control of the motion of Bose--Einstein condensates.
