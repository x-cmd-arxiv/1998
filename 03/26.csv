neutron stars via the helium-star supernova channel. The predicted relative
number of short-period transients provides a sensitive test of the input
physics in this process. We investigate the effect of varying mean kick
velocities, orbital angular momentum loss efficiencies, and common envelope
ejection efficiencies on the subpopulation of short-period systems, both
transient and persistent. Guided by the thermal-viscous disk instability model
in irradiation-dominated disks, we posit that short-period transients have
donors close to the end of core-hydrogen burning. We find that with increasing
mean kick velocity the overall short-period fraction, s, grows, while the
fraction, r, of systems with evolved donors among short-period systems drops.
This effect, acting in opposite directions on these two fractions, allows us to
constrain models of LMXB formation through comparison with observational
estimates of s and r. Without fine tuning or extreme assumptions about
evolutionary parameters, consistency between models and current observations is
achieved for a regime of intermediate average kick magnitudes of about 100-200
km/s, provided that (i) orbital braking for systems with donor masses in the
range 1-1.5 solar masses is weak, i.e., much less effective than a simple
extrapolation of standard magnetic braking beyond 1.0 solar mass would suggest,
and (ii) the efficiency of common envelope ejection is low.

the giant H II region 30 Doradus nebula in three different emission lines. The
images allow us to study the nebula with a physical resolution that is within a
factor of two of that typical of ground based observations of Galactic H II
regions. Most of the emission within 30 Dor is confined to a thin zone located
between the hot interior of the nebula and surrounding dense molecular
material. This zone appears to be directly analogous to the photoionized
photoevaporative flows that dominate emission from small, nearby H II regions.
The dynamical effects of the photoevaporative flow can be seen. The ram
pressure in the photoevaporative flow, derived from thermal pressure at the
surface of the ionization front, is found to balance with the pressure in the
interior of the nebula derived from previous x-ray observations. By analogy
with the comparison of ground and HST images of M16 we infer that the same
sharply stratified structure seen in HST images of M16 almost certainly
underlies the observed structure in 30 Dor. 30 Doradus is a crucial case
because it allows us to bridge the gap between nearby H II regions and the
giant H II regions seen in distant galaxies. The real significance of this
result is that it demonstrates that the physical understanding gained from
detailed study of photoevaporative interfaces in nearby H II regions can be
applied directly to interpretation of giant H II regions.

ac-currents at all frequencies exist independently of whether they are measured

charge and current conserving for all Fourier components of the current. We
find that the photo-current can be considered as an up- and down-conversion of
the harmonic potentials associated with the displacement currents. As an
example explicit calculations are presented for a resonant double barrier
coupled to two reservoirs and capacitively coupled to a gate. Two experimental
situations are considered: in the first case the ac-field is applied via a
gate, and in the second case one of the contact potentials is modulated. For
the first case we show that the relative weight of the conduction sidebands
varies with the screening properties of the system. In contrast to the
non-interacting case the relative weights are not determined by Bessel
functions. Moreover, interactions can give rise to an asymmetry between
absorption and emission peaks. In the contact driven case, the theory predicts
a zero-bias current proportional to the asymmetry of the double barrier. This
is in contrast to the discussion of Tien and Gordon which, in violation of

qualitatively understood from a periodic-orbit-expansion for a spherical
cavity. To describe the changes in the supershell structure for different
materials, one has, however, to go beyond that simple model. We show how
periodic-orbit-expansions for realistic cluster potentials can be derived by
expanding only the classical radial action around the limiting case of a
spherical potential well. We give analytical results for the leptodermous
expansion of Woods-Saxon potentials and show that it describes the shift of the
supershells as the surface of a cluster potential gets softer. As a byproduct
of our work, we find that the electronic shell and supershell structure is not
affected by a lattice contraction, which might be present in small clusters.

shorter than the radiation reaction time scale, it is also an excellent
approximation to treat the system as evolving through a sequence of equilibrium
states, in each of which the gravitational radiation is neglected. In Newtonian
gravity, one can simplify the hydrodynamic equations considerably for an
equilibrium irrotational binary by introducing a velocity potential. The
equations reduce to a Poisson-like equation for the potential, and a
Bernoulli-type integral for the density. We show that a similar simplification

the all-order resummed effect of these terms. It is pointed out that the
next-to-leading logarithmic corrections produce an unexpectedly large
suppression factor over the experimentally accessible range of $x$ and $Q^{2}$.
This implies that the next-to-leading logarithmic contributions are very
important in order to obtain a definite prediction.

However, $N_c(V+A)\sim 2$ is ruled out by $B^\pm\to\phi K^\pm$ and $B\to\phi

enhanced considerably at small values of 1/N_c(V+A) so that it is compatible
with experiment. In particular, the measurement of $B^0\to\eta' K^0$ is now
well explained without resorting to any new mechanism or new physics beyond the
Standard Model. Finally, we point out that it is difficult to understand the
observed large branching ratio of $B^\pm\to\omega K^\pm$ within the present

of an infrared cutoff. Inserting both the longitudinal and the transverse part

of the dynamically generated fermion mass on the temperature and the cutoff

by Mari\~no and Moore's remark that the blowup formula of the $u$-plane
integral contains a piece that can be interpreted as a single-time tau function

multi-time version without spoiling the modular invariance of the blowup

$e^{Q(t_1,t_2,...)}$ and a theta function. The time variables $t_n$ play the

exceptional divisor $B$. The coefficients $q_{mn}$ of the Gaussian part are
identified to be the contact terms of these 2-observables. This identification
is further examined in the language of Whitham equations. All relevant

order in the height function. For a harmonic traveling wave on the surface, we
find many different regimes in which the radiation is restricted to certain
directions. It is shown that high frequency photons are emitted in a beam with
relatively low angular dispersion whose direction can be controlled by the
mechanical deformations of the plate.

of a quantum computer based on trapped ions. Emphasis is placed on the
decoherence arising from the vibrational motion of the ions, which is compared
with that due to spontaneous emission from excited states of the ions. The
calculation is made tractable by exploiting the vast difference in time scales
between the vibrational excitations and the intra-ionic electronic excitations.
Since the latter are several orders of magnitude faster, an adiabatic
approximation is used to integrate them out and find the inclusive probability
P(t) for the elec- tronic state of the ions to evolve as it would in the
absence of vibrational coupling, and the ions to evolve into any state
whatsoever. The decoherence time is found at zero temperature and for any
number of ions N in the computer. Comparison is made with the spontaneous
emission decoherence, and the implications for how trap voltages and other
parameters should be scaled with N are discussed.

We review the construction of the Fourier transform on an Abelian group and the
principles underlying the fast Fourier transform algorithm. We describe the
implementation of the FFT algorithm for the group of integers modulo 2^n in the
quantum context, showing how the group-theoretic formalism leads to the
standard quantum network and identifying the property of entanglement that
gives rise to the exponential speedup (compared to the classical FFT). Finally
we outline the use of the Fourier transform in extracting periodicities, which
underlies its utility in the known quantum algorithms.

by magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling. This important experimental

variational method with local and non-local interaction between the particles.
