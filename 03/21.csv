the observed evolution of the number of Lyman-alpha absorption lines over the
whole observed interval of z=0.5 to z=4. In particular, our simulations show
that the decrease in the rate of evolution of Lyman-alpha absorption lines at

decline in the photo-ionizing background resulting from the rapid decline in
quasar numbers at low redshift.

on three timescales (days, weeks, and months) using the ROSAT HRI. The quasars
were chosen to lie at the two extreme ends of the ROSAT PSPC spectral index
distribution and hence of the H$\beta$ FWHM distribution. The observation
strategy has been carefully designed to provide even sampling on these three
basic timescales and to provide a uniform sampling among the quasars We have
found clear evidence that the X-ray steep, narrow H_beta, quasars
systematically show larger amplitude variations than the X-ray flat broad
H_beta quasars on timescales from 2 days to 20 days. On longer timescales we do
not find significant differences between steep and flat quasars, although the
statistics are poorer. We suggest that the above correlation between
variability properties and spectral steepness can be explained in a scenario in
which the X-ray steep, narrow line objects are in a higher L/L_Edd state with
respect to the X-ray flat, broad line objects. We evaluated the power spectrum
of PG1440+356 (the brigthest quasar in our sample) between 2E-7 and 1E-3 Hz,
where it goes into the noise. The power spectrum is roughly consistent with a
1/f law between 1E-3 and 2E-6 Hz. Below this frequency it flattens
significantly.

afterglows are rarer than supernovae, they are detectable at greater distances
because of their higher intrinsic luminosity. Assuming that GRBs trace the
cosmic star formation history and that every GRB gives rise to a bright
afterglow, we find that the average detection rate of supernovae and afterglows
should be comparable at limiting magnitudes brighter than K=18. The actual rate
of afterglows is expected to be somewhat lower since only a fraction of all
gamma-ray selected GRBs were observed to have associated afterglows. However,
the rate could also be higher if the initial gamma-ray emission from GRB
sources is more beamed than their late afterglow emission. Hence, current and
future supernova searches can place strong constraints on the afterglow
appearance fraction and the initial beaming angle of GRB sources.

Local-Group hypothesis for the HVCs connects their properties to the
hierarchical structure formation scenario and to the gas seen in absorbtion
towards quasars. We begin by showing that at least one HVC complex (besides the
Magellanic Stream) must be extragalactic at a distance > 40 kpc from the
Galactic center, with a diameter > 20 kpc and a mass > 1e8 solar masses.
  We interpret the more distant HVCs as dark matter ``mini--halos'' moving
along filaments towards the Local Group. Most poor galaxy groups should contain
HI structures to large distances bound to the group. The HVCs are local
analogues of the Lyman--limit clouds
  We argue that there is a Galactic fountain in the Milky Way, but that the
fountain does not explain the origin of the HVCs. Our analysis of the HI data
leads to the detection of a vertical infall of low-velocity gas towards the
plane. This implies that the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk is
governed by episodic infall of metal-poor HVC gas that only slowly mixes with
the rest of the interstellar medium.
  The Local--Group infall hypothesis makes a number of testable predictions.
The HVCs should have sub-solar metallicities. Their H$\alpha $ emission should
be less than that seen from the Magellanic Stream. The clouds should not be
seen in absorption to nearby stars. The clouds should be detectable in both
emission and absorption around other groups.

types, imaged in the near-IR J and K bands. Parameters are calculated

  We find that bulge profiles are not well-fitted by the classic de Vaucouleurs
profile, and that exponential or R^1/2 fits are preferred. Bulge-to-disk ratio
correlates only weakly with Hubble type. Many of the galaxies show central
reddening of their J-K colours, which we interpret as due to nuclear starbursts
or dusty AGN.
  We define a new method for measuring the strength of bars, which we call
Equivalent Angle. We stress that this is better than the traditional
bar-interbar contrast, as it is not subject to seeing and resolution effects.
  Bars are found in 40 of the 45 galaxies, 9 of which had been previously
classified as unbarred. Bar strengths are found not to correlate with disk
surface brightness or the presence of near neighbours, but a tendency is found
for the most strongly barred galaxies to lie within a restricted, intermediate
range of bulge-to-disk ratio. Bar light profiles are found to be either flat or
exponentially decreasing along their long axes, with profile type not
correlating strongly with Hubble type. Bar short axis profiles are
significantly asymmetric, with the steeper profile being generally on the
leading edge, assuming trailing arms. In the K-band we find bars with higher
axial ratios than have been found previously in optical studies.

calculate different characteristics of the underlying density perturbation such
as arm strengths, profiles and cross-sections, and spiral pitch angles.
Contrary to expectations, no correlation was found between arm pitch angle and
Hubble type, and combined with previous results this leads us to conclude that
the morphology of the old stellar population bears little resemblance to the
optical morphology used to classify galaxies.
  The arm properties of our galaxies seem inconsistent with predictions from
the simplest density wave theories, and some observations, such as variations
in pitch angle within galaxies, seem hard to reconcile even with more complex
modal theories. Bars have no detectable effect on arm strengths for the present
sample.
  We have also obtained B-band images of three of the galaxies. For these
galaxies we have measured arm cross-sections and strengths, to investigate the
effects of disk density perturbations on star formation in spiral disks. We
find that B-band arms lead K-band arms and are narrower than K-band arms,
apparently supporting predictions made by the large scale shock scenario,

report Barkhausen noise measurements on Fe$_{21}$Co$_{64}$B$_{15}$ amorphous

displays a depinning transition as the field is increased. The long-range
dipolar interactions are shown to set the upper critical dimension to $d_c=3$,
which implies that mean-field exponents (with possible logarithmic correction)
are expected to describe the Barkhausen effect. We introduce a mean-field
infinite-range model and show that it is equivalent to a previously introduced
single-degree-of-freedom model, known to reproduce several experimental
results. We numerically simulate the equation in $d=3$, confirming the
theoretical predictions. We compute the avalanche distributions as a function
of the field driving rate and the intensity of the demagnetizing field. The
scaling exponents change linearly with the driving rate, while the cutoff of
the distribution is determined by the demagnetizing field, in remarkable

the nondegenerate Anderson model, the depression of the low-energy scattering

that a chiral bilepton gauge model based on the gauge group SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X

account the three families of fermions. This result does not depend on the
neutrino masses. Charge quantization occurs either the neutrinos are massless

to this particular initial condition, our analytical approach differs

loops per unit volume with physical length between l and l + dl at time t. The
dynamical processes which change the length of loops are then estimated and an
equation, which we call the `rate equation', is derived for (dn/dt). In a
non-expanding universe, the loops should reach the equilibrium distribution
predicted by string statistical mechanics. Analysis of the rate equation gives
results consistent with this. We then study the rate equation in an expanding
universe and suggest that three different final states are possible for the
evolving loop network, each of which may well be realised for some initial
conditions. If the initial energy density in loops in the radiation era is low,
then the loops rapidly disappear. For large initial energy densities, we expect
that either infinite strings are formed or that the loops tend towards a
scaling solution in the radiation era and then rapidly disappear in the matter
era. Such a scenario may be relevant given recent work highlighting the
problems with structure formation from the standard cosmic string scenario.

network. The analysis is done for a reduced membrane model with a
biophysically-based synaptic influence. We argue that such a reduced model can
quantitatively capture the frequency behavior of a larger class of neuronal
models. We show that in different parameter regimes, the network frequency
depends in different ways on the intrinsic and synaptic time constants. Only in
one portion of the parameter space, called `phasic', is the network period
proportional to the synaptic decay time. These results are discussed in
connection with previous work of the authors, which showed that for mildly
heterogeneous networks, the synchrony breaks down, but coherence is preserved
much more for systems in the phasic regime than in the other regimes. These
results imply that for mildly heterogeneous networks, the existence of a
coherent rhythm implies a linear dependence of the network period on synaptic
decay time, and a much weaker dependence on the drive to the cells. We give
experimental evidence for this conclusion.

Hamiltonian is studied. The control procedure is implemented as a sequence of
radiofrequency pulses that repetitively flip the state of the system, a
technique that can be termed quantum ""bang-bang"" control after its classical
analog. Decoherence introduced by the system's interaction with a quantum
environment is shown to be washed out completely in the limit of continuous
flipping and greatly suppressed provided the interval between the pulses is
made comparable to the correlation time of the environment. The model suggests
a strategy to fight against decoherence that complements existing quantum
error-correction techniques.
