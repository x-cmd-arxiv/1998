Accepted for publication in Ap J",,"10.1086/311362",,"astro-ph",,"  For faint photometric surveys our ability to quantify the clustering of
galaxies has depended on interpreting the angular correlation function as a
function of the limiting magnitude of the data. Due to the broad redshift
distribution of galaxies at faint magnitude limits the correlation signal has
been extremely difficult to detect and interpret. We introduce a new technique
for measuring the evolution of clustering. We utilize photometric redshifts,
derived from multicolor surveys, to isolate redshift intervals and calculate
the evolution of the amplitude of the angular 2-pt correlation function.
Applying these techniques to the the Hubble Deep Field we find that the shape
of the correlation function, at z=1, is consistent with a power law with a
slope of -0.8. For z>0.4 the best fit to the data is given by a model of
clustering evolution with a comoving r0 = 2.37 Mpc and eps = -0.4 +/- 0.5,
consistent with published measures of the clustering evolution. To match the
canonical value of r0 = 5.4 Mpc, found for the clustering of local galaxies,
requires a value of eps = 2.10 +/- 0.5 (significantly more than linear
evolution). The log likelihood of this latter fit is 4.15 less than that for
the r0 = 2.37 Mpc model. We, therefore, conclude that the parameterization of
the clustering evolution of (1+z)^-(3+eps) is not a particularly good fit to
the data.

such material to decrease by a factor approx 2 in the approx 0.7--1.0 keV band

comparison with detailed photoionization models we show this behaviour is
inconsistent with that expected from a single-zone of photoionized gas. A
deficit in the data compared to such models, consistent with excess absorption
by Oviii, supports the suggestion that the material consists of two or more
zones.
  Significant Fe K-shell emission is also observed during both epochs. We show
this emission is dominated by the asymmetric line profile expected from the
innermost regions of the accretion flow. We find no evidence that the Fe
emission varied in either shape or equivalent width between the two epochs.

a set of shells formed in the merger between an elliptical and a smaller galaxy

with the maximum line-of-sight velocity increasing linearly as one moves inward
from a shell edge. A simple analytic calculation shows that this structure
provides a direct measure of the gradient of the gravitational potential at the
shell radius. In order to extract this information from attainable data, we
have also derived the complete distribution of line-of-sight velocities for
material within a shell; comparing the observed spectra of a shell to a stellar
template convolved with this distribution will enable us to measure the
gradient of the potential at this radius. Repeating the analysis for a whole

SiO traces gas affected by shocks and high temperature chemistry. The J =2-1
line of SiO is seen only in few regions of the Galactic disk. This line is
easily detected in all Galactic center sources observed. A comparison of the
strength of the rare isotopomers 29SiO and 30SiO to the strength of the main
isotopomer 28SiO implies that the J = 2-1 transition of 28SiO is optically
thick. The 29Si/30Si isotope ratio of 1.6 in the Galactic center clouds is
consistent with the terrestrial value. Large Velocity Gradient models show that
the dense component (n_(H_2) > 10^4cm-3) in typical molecular cores in the
Galactic center is cool (TKIN ~ 25K), contrary to what is usually found in
Giant Molecular Clouds in the disk, where the densest cores are the hottest.
High kinetic temperatures, > 100K, known to exist from NH_3 studies, are only
present at lower gas densities of a few 10^3cm-3, where SiO is highly
subthermal. Assuming that C18O traces all of the molecular gas, it is found
that in all cases but one, SiO emission is compatible with arising in gas at
higher density that is (presently) relatively cool. The relative abundance of
SiO is typically 10^-9, but differs significantly between individual sources.
It shows a dependence on the position of the source within the Galactic center
region. High abundances are found in those regions for which bar potential
models predict a high likelihood for cloud-cloud collisions. These results can
be used to relate the amount of gas that has encountered shocks within the last
~ 10^6 years to the large scale kinematics in the inner ~500pc of the Galaxy.

narrow features, comparable to the instrumental energy resolution. To
investigate whether this leads to significant non-Gaussian deviations between

experience frequent starquakes, possibly driven by an evolving, ultra-strong
magnetic field. The empirical power-law distribution of SGR burst energies,
analogous to the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes, exhibits a turn-over at
high energies consistent with a global limit on the crust fracture size. With
such large starquakes occurring, the significant excitation of global seismic
oscillations (GSOs) seems likely. Moreover, GSOs may be self-exciting in a
stellar crust that is strained by many, randomly-oriented stresses. We explain
why low-order toroidal modes, which preserve the shape of the star and have
observable frequencies as low as ~ 30 Hz, may be especially susceptible to
excitation. We estimate the eigenfrequencies as a function of stellar mass and
radius, and their magnetic and rotational shiftings/splittings. We also
describes ways in which these modes might be detected and damped. There is
marginal evidence for 23 ms oscillations in the hard initial pulse of the 1979

diluted antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ladders, composed of two spin--1/2 chains.
For weak and intermediate inter--chain couplings, $J_{\bot}/J \leq 1$, we find
an enhancement of correlations that is strongest for a fraction $z^* \approx
J_{\bot}/(8J)$ of dilutants. We are able to access the experimentally relevant
low--temperature regime, $T/J \approx 1/500$, and find that the recently
inferred N\'eel temperature of $Sr(Cu_{1-z}Zn_z)_2O_3$ corresponds to a curve
of constant correlation length $\xi \approx 18$ of the single diluted ladder
with $J_{\bot}/J \alt 1/2$. The primary reason for the N\'eel ordering is
argued to be a strong enhancement of two--dimensional correlations due to a
Cu--Sr--Cu exchange coupling of $\approx 10 meV$ in the stacking direction of
the ladders.

corrections to the resistance, and the phase breaking is due to the
quasi-elastic electron-electron interactions (the Nyquist noise). The
temperature dependence of the phase coherence time does not saturate, and the
quasiparticle states remain well defined over the whole WL temperature range.
This fact, as well as observation of the Thouless crossover in 1D samples,
argues against the idea of intrinsic decoherence by zero-point fluctuations of
the electrons (Mohanty et al., Phys.Rev.Lett. 78, 3366 (1997)). We believe that

apparent discrepancy between the perturbative scale $\Lambda_{QCD}$ and the
``chiral lagrangian'' scale $\Lambda_\chi$. We show that in N=1 supersymmetric
Yang Mills theory, ``naive dimensional analysis'' seems to work well, with
$\Lambda_\chi$ consistently equal to the scale at which the perturbatively
evolved physical coupling becomes of order $4 \pi$. We turn to N=2 theories to
understand better the effect of instantons in accounting for the QCD
discrepancy between scales. In N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) the instanton
corrections are known to all orders from the Seiberg-Witten solution and give
rise to a finite scale ratio between the scale at which the perturbatively
evolved and ``nonperturbatively evolved'' couplings blow up. Correspondingly,
instanton effects are important even when the associated perturbatively evolved
gauge coupling only gives $\alpha$ of order 1 (rather than $4 \pi$). We compare
the N=2 result to instanton-induced corrections in QCD, evaluated using lattice
data and the instanton liquid model, and find a remarkably similar behavior.

differences between the two models in their representation of the effects of an

the SO(5) model. On the other hand, in odd-odd nuclei with N not equal to Z

determinants of second-order differential operators. We relate these ratios to
the Green functions of the operators for Dirichlet, periodic and antiperiodic
boundary conditions on a line segment. This permits us to take advantage of
Wronski's construction method for Green functions without knowledge of
eigenvalues. Our final formula expresses the ratios of functional determinants
in terms of an ordinary $2\times2$ -determinant of a constant matrix
constructed from two linearly independent solutions of a the homogeneous
differential equations associated with the second-order differential operators.
For ratios of determinants encountered in semiclassical fluctuations around a
classical solution, the result can further be expressed in terms of this
classical solution.
  In the presence of a zero mode, our method allows for a simple universal
regularization of the functional determinants. For Dirichlet's boundary
condition, our result is equivalent to Gelfand-Yaglom's.
  Explicit formulas are given for a harmonic oscillator with an arbitrary
time-dependent frequency.

locally among distant nodes in a quantum network. The complexity associated
with the generation of multiparticle entangled states is quantified in terms of
the concept of global cost. This parameter allows us to compare the use of
physical resources in different schemes. We show that for ideal channels and
for a sufficiently large number of nodes, the use of maximally entangled states
is advantageous over uncorrelated ones. For noisy channels, one has to use
entanglement purification procedures in order to create entangled states of
high fidelity. We show that under certain circumstances a quantum network
supplied with a maximally entangled input still yields a smaller global cost,
provided that $n$ belongs to a given interval $n\in [n_{min},n_{max}]$. The
values of $n_{min}$ and $n_{max}$ crucially depend on the purification
protocols used to establish the $n$-- processor entangled states, as well as on
the presence of decoherence processes during the computation. The phase
estimation problem has been used to illustrate this fact.
