consider the interaction of these blobs with the magnetic field of a compact,
accreting star, where diamagnetic blobs suffer a drag. We show that when the
magnetic moment is not aligned with the spin axis, the resulting force is
pulsed, and this can lead to resonance with the oscillation of the blobs around
the equatorial plane; a resonance condition where energy is effectively pumped

discuss the conditions of applicability of this result, showing that they are
quite wide. We also show that realistic complications, such as chaotic magnetic

cosmological mass aggregation history (MAH). We generate the MAHs for a
Gaussian density fluctuation field, and we calculate the gravitational collapse
and virialization of the dark halos. Assuming detailed angular momentum
conservation, disks in centrifugal equilibrium are built-up within them. The
disk galactic evolution is followed through a physically self-consistent
approach. The main disk galaxy properties and their correlations are determined
by the mass, the MAH, and the spin parameter. The models give exponential disk
surface brightness (SB) profiles with realistic parameters (including LSB
galaxies), nearly flat rotation curves, and negative gradients in the B-V
radial profile. The main trends across the Hubble sequence are reproduced. A
maximum in the star formation rate for most of the models is attained at z~
1.5-2.5 (this rate is approximately 2.5-4.0 times larger than the present one).
The scale radii and the bulge-to-total ratios decrease with z, while the
central SB increase. The B-band TF relation remains almost the same at
different redshifts. Our scenario reveals that the cosmological initial
conditions are able to determine the main properties of disk galaxies and
predict evolutionary features for the present-day dominant galaxy population

discovered by ASCA and ROSAT/HRI observations. If the spherical symmetric mass
distribution model of the cluster is assumed, the lensing estimate of the
cluster mass is a factor of two higher than that obtained from X-ray
observations as reported for many distant clusters. However, the elliptical and
clumpy lens model proposed by Kneib et al.(1993) is surprisingly consistent
with the X-ray observations assuming that the X-ray emitting hot gas is
isothermal and in a hydrostatic equilibrium state. The existence of the cooling
flow in the central region of the cluster is indicated by the short central
cooling time and the excess flux detected by ROSAT/HRI compared to the ASCA
flux. However, it is shown that even if the AXJ2239-0429 has a cooling flow in
the central region, the temperature measured by ASCA which is the mean
emission-weighted cluster temperature in this case, should not be cooler than
and different from the virial temperature of the cluster. Therefore, we
conclude that the effect of the clumpiness and non-zero ellipticity in the mass
distribution of the cluster are essential to explain the observed feature of
the giant luminous arc, and there is no discrepancy between strong lensing and
X-ray estimation of the mass of the cluster in this cluster.

the group cores are close to virialization or virialized. We detect significant

spatial extent of their X-ray emission. Cluster X-ray luminosities range from
10^42 erg/s to ~5x10^44 erg/s, i.e. from poor groups to rich clusters. The
cluster redshifts range from z=0.015 to z>0.5. The catalog lists X-ray fluxes,

detections arising from blends of unresolved point X-ray sources, and for 5 we
have not obtained deep CCD images. Above a flux of 2e-13 erg/s/cm**2, 98\% of
extended X-ray sources are optically confirmed clusters. The log N-log S
relation derived from our catalog shows excellent agreement with previous
results: EMSS and ROSAT All-Sky survey BCS in teh bright end and WARPS at

Twenty-three flat-spectrum, radio-loud sources were imaged. These are the first
VLBI images for 15 of the sources. Eight of the sources are EGRET (> 100 MeV)
gamma-ray sources. The milliarcsecond morphology shows a core-jet structure for
12 sources, and a single compact core for the remaining 11. No compact doubles
were seen. Compared with other radio images at different epochs and/or
different frequencies, 3 core-jet blazars show evidence of bent jets, and there
is some evidence for superluminal motion in the cases of 2 blazars. The
detailed descriptions for individual blazars are given. This is the second part
of a survey: the first part was reported by Shen et al. (AJ 114(1997)1999).

there is also an energy release of black hole formation comparable to what is

  Inside the Sun and Stars', in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Lithium is an excellent tracer of mixing in stars as it is destroyed (by
nuclear reactions) at a temperature around $\sim 2.5\times 10^6$ K. The lithium
destruction zone is typically located in the radiative region of a star. If the
radiative regions are stable, the observed surface value of lithium should
remain constant with time. However, comparison of the meteoritic and
photospheric Li abundances in the Sun indicate that the surface abundance of Li
in the Sun has been depleted by more than two orders of magnitude. This is not
predicted by solar models and is a long standing problem. Observations of Li in
open clusters indicate that Li depletion is occurring on the main sequence.
Furthermore, there is now compelling observational evidence that a spread of
lithium abundances is present in nearly identical stars. This suggests that
some transport process is occurring in stellar radiative regions. Helioseismic
inversions support this conclusion, for they suggest that standard solar models
need to be modified below the base of the convection zone. There are a number
of possible theoretical explanations for this transport process. The relation
between Li abundances, rotation rates and the presence of a tidally locked
companion along with the observed internal rotation in the Sun indicate that
the mixing is most likely induced by rotation. The current status of
non-standard (particularly rotational) stellar models which attempt to account
for the lithium observations are reviewed.

chaining occurs, e.g., in a large nematic drop with homeotropic boundary
conditions at all the surfaces. Between each pair of water droplets a point
defect in the liquid crystalline order was found in accordance with topological
constraints. This point defect causes a repulsion between the water droplets.
In our numerical investigation we limit ourselves to a chain of two droplets.
For such a complex geometry we use the method of finite elements to minimize
the Frank free energy. We confirm an experimental observation that the distance
d of the point defect from the surface of a water droplet scales with the
radius r of the droplet like d = 0.3 * r. When the water droplets are moved
apart, we find that the point defect does not stay in the middle between the
droplets, but rather forms a dipole with one of them. This confirms a
theoretical model for the chaining. Analogies to a second order phase
transition are drawn. We also find the dipole when one water droplet is
suspended in a bipolar nematic drop with two boojums, i.e., surface defects at

with black hole radiances. Here we review the principles of inertial motion
superradiance and prove thermodynamically that the Ginzburg--Frank condition

vector superfield coupling and the ""holomorphic"" gauge coupling, which is a
chiral superfield running only at 1 loop. We consider these issues for a number
of regulators, including dimensional reduction. With this method, the
renormalization group equations for soft supersymmetry breaking terms are
directly related to supersymmetric beta functions and anomalous dimensions to
all orders in perturbation theory. However, the real power of the formalism
lies in computing finite soft breaking effects corresponding to high-loop
component calculations. We prove that the gaugino mass in gauge-mediated
supersymmetry breaking is ``screened'' from strong interactions in the

gaugino masses (2 loops) and sfermion masses (3 loops) in minimal gauge

this variety, that is, the ring having its 3-point Gromov-Witten invariants as
structure constants. This is of considerable interest, for example as the base
ring of the quantum category in Seiberg-Witten theory. The main results give an
explicit, general formula for the quantum product in this ring unless d is in

third order terms. Explicit generators and relations are also given unless d is
in [4/5 g - 3/5, g-1). The virtual class on the space of stable maps plays a
significant role. But the central ideas ultimately come from Brill-Noether
theory: specifically a formula of Harris-Tu for the Chern numbers of
determinantal varieties. The case d = g-1 is especially interesting: it
resembles that of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold, and the Aspinwall-Morrison formula
enters the calculations. A detailed analogy with Givental's work is also

which complex short ranged Gaussian potentials are added in the spirit of the
optical models of nuclear physics and of diffraction models of high energy
physics. The data to 2.5 GeV are all well fit. The energy dependences of these
Gaussians are very smooth save for precise effects caused by the known $\Delta$

implications of the profile function found from diffraction scattering are
pertinent in the regime 300 MeV to 2.5 GeV and that the overwhelming part of
meson production comes from the QCD sector of the nucleons when they have a
separation of their centres of 1 to 1.2 fm. This analysis shows that the
