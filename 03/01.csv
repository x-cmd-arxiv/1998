heterostructures are studied in the integer quantum Hall states. We emphasize
the criticality of the surface state and the phase coherent transport
properties in the thermodynamic limit. A new, stable numerical algorithm for
large scale conductance calculations in the transfer matrix approach is
discussed in detail. It is then applied to a directed network model describing
the quantum mechanical tunneling and impurity scattering of the multilayer edge
states. We calculate the two-probe conductance in the direction parallel to the
external magnetic field, its fluctuations and statistical distributions as a
function of the interlayer tunneling strength. Using finite size scaling, the
asymptotic scaling functions of the ensemble averaged conductance and the
conductance fluctuations are calculated for a fixed aspect ratio and found to
be in remarkable agreement with the analytical results obtained using the
supersymmetric nonlinear $\sigma$-model approach. The conductance distribution
is determined in the quasi-one-dimensional metallic, insulating, as well as the
crossover regime where comparisons are made to that at the single-layer quantum
Hall transition. We present, for the first time, a detailed study of the level
statistics in the eigenvalue spectrum of the transfer matrix. Coexistence of
metallic and insulating statistics is observed in the crossover regime, which
is attributed to the emergence of a finite range level repulsion in the
crossover regime, separating the metallic (Wigner-surmise) behavior at small
level spacings from the insulating (uncorrelated or Poisson) behavior at large
level spacings.

  Electron-electron interaction in the film is assumed to be repulsive. The
system is macroscopically superconductive when the distance between
neighbouring islands is short enough. The zero-temperature phase transition
from superconductive to normal-conductive state is shown to occur with the
increase of distance between superconductive islands; the logarithm of the
critical distance is proportional to the low-frequency zero-voltage Andreev
conductance between the SC island and the film. This critical distance is
always much less the than the two-dimensional localization length, so the
considered effect develops when weak-localization corrections are still small.
The dependence of the critical temperature on the film conductance and

categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent
approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very
efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be
(re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the
domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these
approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the
knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we
investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis
tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture
called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used
to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a
declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific
to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive
domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative
theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach
by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space
refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform
classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP,
Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will
contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional
methods for customizing domain independent planners.

for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing

of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain
assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of
the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero
entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the
ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for
this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically
demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large
real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates
memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be
deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near
its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net
structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection
algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree
methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the
possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the
merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as
kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.

given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly
flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The
theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the
theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training
examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions
are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is
to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching
problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain
theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of
determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of
what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining
stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that
revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification
of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification
of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used
to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching
algorithms.

such that the self-similar group $H_3$ is of Bianchi type VI and the fluid flow
is tangent to its orbits. The analogous cases with Bianchi types I, II, III, V,
VIII and IX are shown to be impossible thus making this metric privileged from
a mathematical viewpoint. The differential equations determining the metric are
partially integrated and the line-element is given up to a first order
differential equation of Abel type of first kind and two quadratures. The
solutions are qualitatively analyzed by investigating the corresponding
autonomous dynamical system. The spacetime is regular everywhere except for the
big bang and the metric is complete both into the future and in all spatial
directions. The energy-density is positive, bounded from above at any instant
of time and with an spatial profile (in the direction of inhomogeneity) which
is oscillating with a rapidly decreasing amplitude. The generic asymptotic
behaviour at spatial infinity is a homogeneous plane wave. Well-known dynamical
system results indicate that this metric is very likely to describe the
asymptotic behaviour in time of a much more general class of inhomogeneous
$G_2$ dust cosmologies.
