monitored by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer between February and October,
1996. The source was observed in various spectral states; the highest
luminosity state (LX ~ 1.5 10^37 ergs/s, 10 kpc, 1-20 keV) is associated with a
soft spectrum, whereas for the lower luminosity state (down to ~5 10^36 ergs/s)
the spectrum is significantly harder. Using the high time resolution data
provided by the Proportional Counter Array (PCA), we have discovered
High-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) in the persistent X-ray
emission of 4U1915-05 while its luminosity was ~8 10^36 ergs/s. The QPO
frequency ranges from 600 Hz up to ~1000 Hz, with typical Full Width at Half

by using the ``shift and add'' technique, we have detected a twin HFQPO (5.5
sigma level) separated from the main peak by ~355 Hz. 4U1915-05 is the eighth
Atoll source displaying simultaneous twin HFQPOs. Based on current knowledge of
HFQPO sources, our observations suggest that 4U1915-05 might contain a 2.8 (or
5.6) millisecond rotating neutron star.

widths in these positions agree with those seen in HI, confirming that the
molecular gas is indeed associated with the tail rather than the main disk. As
noted previously, the gas in this tail has an apparent `counter-rotation'
compared to gas in the core of the galaxy, probably because the tails do not
lie in the same plane as the disk. Assuming the standard Galactic conversion
N(H2)/I(CO) factor, these observations indicate a total molecular gas mass of 6

if the gas is metal-poor. This molecular gas mass, and the implied H2/HI mass
ratio of 0.6, are higher than that found in many dwarf irregular galaxies.
Comparison with an available H-alpha map of this galaxy, however, shows that
the rate of star formation in this feature is extremely low relative to the
available molecular gas, compared to L(H-alpha)/M(H2) values for both spiral

peculiar velocities and to test for trends in the galaxy population with

with a Gaussian smoothing (radius) length of 1.7 cells. At shock caused

Finally, for \beta model fit clusters, we can approximately correct numerical
resolution by the transformation R^2_{core}\to R^2_{core}-(C\Delta l)^2, where
\Delta l is the cell size and C=1.1-1.7. When we use these corrections on our

of order $\epsilon_{Th}$. In the limit $L_{\phi}<L$ the temperature $T_1$ is
determined by $D \hbar /L^2_{\phi}$ ($L_{\phi}$ is the phase breaking length),

identical charged pion systems $\pi^{\pm} \pi^{\pm} \pi^{\pm}$ have been

three-pion correlations corrected for Coulomb effects, were separated from the
known two-pion correlations by a novel subtraction procedure using the data
events themselves. From this analysis a value of $\mathrm r_3 = 0.580 \pm 0.029

the conjugate variable of parton transverse momentum $k_T$, and the threshold

of a distribution function, is a consequence of opposite directions of
double-logarithm evolutions. The $k_T$ and threshold resummations for an
energetic final-state jet give suppression. The switch of the threshold
resummation from enhancement to suppression is attributed to a nonvanishing jet
invariant mass. In the same framework we derive a unification of the $k_T$ and
threshold resummations for a parton distribution function by requiring infrared
cutoffs for both longitudinal and transverse loop momenta. This unified
resummation exhibits suppression at large $b$, similar to the $k_T$
resummation, and exhibits enhancement at small $b$, similar to the threshold
resummation.

  The system we consider is a stationary membrane (representing a domain wall)
in a static gravitational field of a black hole. For a membrane that spreads to
infinity, the induced 2+1 geometry is asymptotically flat. Besides solutions
with Minkowski topology there exists also solutions with the induced metric and
topology of a 2+1 dimensional black hole. By changing boundary conditions at
infinity, one finds that there is a transition between these two families. This
transition is critical and it possesses all the above-mentioned properties of
critical gravitational collapse. It is remarkable that characteristics of this
transition can be obtained analytically. In particular, we find exact
analytical expressions for scaling exponents and wiggle-periods.

lead us to introduce a novel class of conformal field theories, identified by a
closed quantum conformal algebra. We conjecture that they are the exact
solution to the strongly coupled large-N_c limit of the open conformal field
theories. We study the basic properties of closed conformal field theory and
work out the operator product expansion of the conserved current multiplet T.
The OPE structure is uniquely determined by two central charges, c and a. The
multiplet T does not contain just the stress-tensor, but also R-currents and
finite mass operators. For this reason, the ratio c/a is different from 1. On
the other hand, an open algebra contains an infinite tower of non-conserved
currents, organized in pairs and singlets with respect to renormalization
mixing. T mixes with a second multiplet T* and the main consequence is that c
and a have different subleading corrections. The closed algebra simplifies
considerably at c=a, where it coincides with the N=4 one.

a nonlinear phase diagram for the selected patterns are presented. By virtue of
the elasticity of the material a surface resonance synchronous to the external
drive competes with the usual subharmonic Faraday instability. Close to the
bicriticality the nonlinear wave interaction gives rise to a variety of novel
surface states: Localised patches of hexagons, hexagonal superlattices,
coexistence of hexagons and lines. Theoretical stability calculations and
qualitative resonance arguments support the experimental observations.

implication on the Earth's history are discussed. The model is consistent with
geophysical and astronomical data. The number of days in early epochs predicted
by the model is in agreement with those obtained from fossil corals. The model
predicts that the Earth was initially cold and is gradually heating up during
its course of evolution. The exact law for the variation of $G$ is still to be
obtained from the variation of the
  Earth's parameters with cosmic expansion.

discrete state and two continua are shown to be functionals of the Beutler-
Fano formulas using appropriate dimensionless energy units and line profile
indices. Parameters responsible for the avoided crossing of eigenphase shifts
and eigentime delays are identified. Similarly, parameters responsible for the
eigentime delays due to a frame change are identified. With the help of new
parameters, an analogy with the spin model is pursued for the S matrix and time
delay matrix. The time delay matrix is shown to comprise three terms, one due
to resonance, one due to a avoided crossing interaction, and one due to a frame
change. It is found that the squared sum of time delays due to the avoided
crossing interaction and frame change is unity.

dielectric permittivity of suspensions of arbitrarily shaped, shelled and
charged particles is calculated. It is proved that the dielectric behavior at
low frequencies is dominated by the effects of the diffusion of the free
charges on the shell surfaces. Our theoretical formula is valid in the low
range of frequencies (alpha dispersion) as well as in the high range of
frequencies (beta dispersion). Will result that one can measure the membrane
electrical potential by a simple investigation of the living cell suspension
dielectric properties.

to develop a general perturbative method for the study of atom-field
interaction in quantum optics. In fact, both Dyson series and its dual, through
renormalization group methods to remove secular terms from the perturbation
series, give the opportunity of a full study of the solution of the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation in different ranges of the parameters of the given
hamiltonian. In view of recent experiments with strong laser fields, this
approach seems well-suited to give a clarification and an improvement of the
applications of the dressed states as currently done through the eigenstates of
the atom-field interaction, showing that these are just the leading order of
the dual Dyson series when the Hamiltonian is expressed in the interaction
picture. In order to exploit the method at the best, a study is accomplished of
the well-known Jaynes-Cummings model in the rotating wave approximation, whose
exact solution is known, comparing the perturbative solutions obtained by the
Dyson series and its dual with the same approximations obtained by Taylor
expanding the exact solution. Finally, a full perturbative study of high-order
harmonic generation is given obtaining, through analytical expressions, a clear
account of the power spectrum using a two-level model, even if the method can
be successfully applied to a more general model that can account for ionization
too. The analysis shows that to account for the power spectrum it is needed to
go to first order in the perturbative analysis. The spectrum obtained gives a
way to measure experimentally the shift of the energy levels of the atom
interacting with the laser field by looking at the shifting of hyper-Raman
lines.

acting the vertex operator on the tau-function of the $q$-KP hierarchy. This
establishes the Adler-Shiota-van Moerbeke formula for the $q$-KP hierarchy.
