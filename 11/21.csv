potential, we argue that the pulsars B1913+16, B1534+12, and B2127+11C may be
younger than previously assumed, and we find that a lower bound on the
formation and merger rate of close double neutron star binaries is $10^{-6.7}
f_b^{-1} f_d^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, where $f_b$ is the beaming fraction and $f_d$
accounts for the possibility that the known NS-NS binaries are atypical of the
underlying population (e.g., if most such binaries are born with shorter
orbital periods). If we assume no prior knowledge of the detectable lifetimes
of such systems, the rate could be as large as $\simeq 10^{-5.0} f_b^{-1}
f_d^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. From both plausible bounds on $f_b$ and $f_d$, and a
revision of the independently derived limit proposed by Bailes (1996), we argue
that a firm upper bound is $10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also present a unifying
empirical overview of the spin-up of massive binary pulsars based on their
distribution in spin period $P$ and spin-down rate $\dot P$, finding evidence
for two distinct spin-up processes, one dominated by disk accretion, the other
by wind accretion. We argue that the positions of binary pulsars in the
$P$-$\dot P$ diagram can be understood if (1) there exists a Galactic
population of pulsars in double neutron star systems with combinations of spin
and orbital periods that have prevented their detection in surveys to date; (2)
recycled pulsars in wide-orbit binaries are not born near the canonical spin-up
line in the $P$-$\dot P$ diagram because they were predominantly spun up
through wind accretion; and (3) there exists a disfavored evolutionary endpoint
for radio pulsars with spin periods 5--30 ms and $\dot P > 10^{-19}$
s-s$^{-1}$.

objects comprise a well-defined sample of extragalactic sources chosen by means
that are independent of optical surface brightness selection effects. In this

for some of the optically detected galaxies within the same search volume. We
examine how samples generated by different types of search techniques overlap
with selection by HI flux. Only the least massive HI object, which is among the
lowest mass HI sources previously found, does not have a clear optical
counterpart, but a nearby bright star may hide low surface brightness emission.
However the newly-detected systems do have unusual optical properties. Most of
the 40 galaxies that were not previously identified in magnitude-limited
catalogs appear to be gas-dominated systems, and several of these systems have
HI mass-to-light ratios among the largest values ever previously found. These
gas-dominated objects also tend to have very blue colors, low surface
brightnesses, and no central bulges, which correlate strongly with their
relative star-to-gas content.

is seen largely in only those lobes which are within about 300 kpc of the

asymmetry shows that depolarization is observed predominantly for the lobe
which is closer to the nucleus. There is also a trend for the lobe closer to
the nucleus to be brighter, consistent with the scenario that the nearer lobe
is interacting with a denser environment which is responsible for the higher
depolarization and greater dissipation of energy. We have also examined the
depolarization asymmetry of the lobes on opposite sides of the nucleus for
galaxies and quasars. This shows that the depolarization asymmetry for quasars
is marginally higher than that for galaxies. The depolarization properties of
our sample are possibly determined by an asymmetric environment as well as the

FG Vir, for which 24 frequencies have been detected. Histograms of the
frequency spacings show peaks which are identified with adjacent radial orders
and rotational splitting.
  Pulsational $\ell$ values are deduced for eight modes by comparing the
observed photometric phase lags between $v$ and $y$ variations with calculated
values. The dominant pulsation mode at 12.72 c/d can be identified with $\ell$
= 1, while the 12.15 c/d mode is the radial fundamental. These results are in
agreement with identifications published by Viskum et al. (1998).
  Based on the observational mode identifications and the Hipparcos distance,
new models were computed with the constraint that the mode at 12.15 c/d is the
radial fundamental mode. It is shown that with standard opacities, models in
the appropriate T_eff, log L and log g ranges cannot reproduce the
identification in the literature of 23.40 c/d as the third radial overtone.
However, we show that observationally an $\ell$ = 1 (rather than radial)
identification is equally probable.
  A large number of pulsation models were computed for FG Vir. A comparison
between the observed frequencies and mode identifications and pulsation models
leads to a mean density of <rho>/<rho_sun> = 0.156 +- 0.002 depending on the
opacity and chemical composition choice and on the possible overshooting from
the convective core. The models also correctly predict the observed region of
instability between 9 and 34 c/d.

asymmetric wings Doppler-shifted by about 2000 km/s at the edges, while the HeI
lines show phase-dependent absorption features strikingly similar to SW
Sextantis stars, as well as emission through most of the phase. The CIII/NIII
emission blend does not show any phase dependence. From velocities of Halpha
emission lines, we determine an orbital period of 0.174774 +/- 0.000003 d (=
4.1946 h), which agrees with Szkody's (1995) value of approximately 4.2 hours.
No stable photometric signal was found at the orbital period. A non-coherent
quasi-periodic photometric signal was seen at a period of 20.7 +/- 0.3 min.
  The high-velocity Balmer wings most probably arise from a stream re-impact
point close to the white dwarf. We present simulated spectra based on a
kinematic model similar to the modified disk-overflow scenario of Hellier &
Robinson (1994). The models reproduce the broad line wings, though some other
details are unexplained.
  Using an estimate of dynamical phase based on the model, we show that the
phasing of the emission- and absorption-line variations is consistent with that
in (eclipsing) SW Sex stars. We therefore identify LS Peg as a low-inclination
SW Sex star.
  Our model suggests i = 30 deg, and the observed absence of any photometric
signal at the orbital frequency establishes i < 60 deg. This constraint puts a
severe strain on interpretations of the SW Sex phenomenon which rely on disk
structures lying slightly out of the orbital plane.

stellar initial mass function (IMF) or its variations in space and time, so it
is proposed that theoretical models may provide useful guidance. Several
classes of theoretical models for the physics controlling the IMF are reviewed,
emphasizing the dependence of the results on the probability distribution of
velocity and density fluctuations, the spatial density distribution, the
softness of the equation of state as controlled by the dominant heating and
cooling processes, the ambient radiation field, and the star formation rate
itself. One particularly relevant result is the ability of turbulent
interactions to form high-density condensations, which should vary with
decreasing redshift as the dominant cooling mechanism changes from H$_2$, to
fine structure lines, and finally to CO and gas-grain collisions, due to
corresponding changes in the effective polytropic exponent. A second theme is
the ability of some of these models to produce a characteristic or turnover
mass in the IMF which has nothing to do with the Jeans mass. Further
development of such models should provide IMFs whose functional dependence can
be used as input for simulations of galaxy formation, in which the energy input
from massive stars plays a crucial role, and for calculations of the
consequences of protogalactic star formation on the subequent evolution of the
universe. The probable irrelevance of the concepts of pressure-confined clouds
and the formation of condensations by thermal instability in a turbulent
interstellar medium is also discussed.

gxy(x2-y2)- wave OPs. In YBCO, elements of s- and dx2-y2- wave sets are
compatible, but in BSCCO, elements of s- and dxy- wave sets are compatible. The
Josephson critical current density JcJ across c-axis twist junctions in the
vicinity of Tc is then evaluated as a function of the twist angle phi0, for
each allowable OP combination, for both coherent and incoherent tunneling.
Recent experiments of Li et al. demonstrated the independence of JcJ(phi0)/JcS
upon phi0 at and below Tc, where JcS is the critical current density of a
constituent single crystal. These experiments are shown to be consistent with
an OP containing an s-wave component, but inconsistent with an OP containing
the purported dx2-y2-wave component. In addition, they demonstrate that the
interlayer tunneling across untwisted layers in single crystal BSCCO is
entirely incoherent. We propose a new type of tricrystal experiment using
single crystal c-axis twist junctions, that does not employ substrate grain
boundaries.

process. Solving the corresponding energy-dependent stochastic Riccati equation
in the space-asymptotic regime, we give an exact probabilistic description of
returns to the origin. This method allows for a time-asymptotic
characterization of the underlying dynamical phases. When the two values taken
by the dichotomic force are of different signs, there occur trapping potential
wells with a broad distribution of trapping times and dynamical phases may
appear, depending on the mean force. If both values are negative, the
time-asymptotic mean value of the probability density at the origin is
proportional to the absolute value of the mean force. If they are both
positive, traps no more exist and the dynamics is always normal. Problems with
a shot-noise force and with a Gaussian white-noise force are solved as

dealing with only a small number of TCP trunk flows, a router with a simple

  A TCP trunk is a ""soft"" circuit in the sense that it requires no flow states

configuring the two end nodes. This is in contrast with traditional methods of
configuring circuits via signaling of network nodes.
  A simple packet-dropping mechanism based on packet accounting at the

in response to network congestion, user TCP flows carried by the trunk will
reduce their bandwidths by the same proportion. Simu lation results have

SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y and that the SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y-charged
spectrum of the observable sector should consist solely of the MSSM spectrum.
We demonstrate that string models can actually be constructed that possess
these observable features. Two aspects generic to many classes of three family
SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y string models are both an extra local anomalous
U(1)_A and numerous (often fractionally charged) exotic particles beyond the

the string scale can simultaneously break the anomalous U(1) and give mass to
all exotic SM-charged observable particles, decoupling them from the low energy
spectrum. In this letter we show, in the context of free fermionic strings,
that string models with flat directions possessing these features do exist. We
present one such string derived model in which all such exotic observable
states beyond the MSSM receive mass at the scale generated by the Fayet-

can lower the fundamental GUT, Planck, and string scales. However, recent
evidence for neutrino oscillations suggests the existence of light non-zero
neutrino masses, which in turn suggests the need for a heavy mass scale via the
seesaw mechanism. In this paper, we make several observations in this regard.
First, we point out that allowing the right-handed neutrino to experience extra
spacetime dimensions naturally permits the left-handed neutrino mass to be
power-law suppressed relative to the masses of the other fermions. This occurs
due to the power-law running of the neutrino Yukawa couplings, and therefore
does not require a heavy scale for the right-handed neutrino. Second, we show
that a higher-dimensional analogue of the seesaw mechanism may also be capable
of generating naturally light neutrino masses without the introduction of a
heavy mass scale. Third, we show that such a higher-dimensional seesaw
mechanism may even be able to explain neutrino oscillations without neutrino
masses, with oscillations induced indirectly via the masses of the Kaluza-Klein
states. Fourth, we point out that even when higher-dimensional right-handed
neutrinos are given a bare Majorana mass, the higher-dimensional seesaw
mechanism surprisingly replaces this mass scale with the radius scale of the
extra dimensions. Finally, we also discuss a possible new mechanism for
inducing lepton-number violation by shifting the positions of D-branes in Type
I string theory.

source charge increases the apparent source size by weakening the correlation
at non-zero relative momenta. The effect is strongest for pairs with a small
total momentum and is stronger for kaons than for pions of the same momenta.
The experimental data currently available are well described by this effect
without invoking Pratt's exploding source model. A simple expression is
proposed to account for the effect.

studying quantum systems that create valid physical theories using mathematics
and physics. An essential part of the validation process for quantum mechanics
is the development of a coherent theory of mathematics and quantum mechanics
together. Such a theory should combine mathematical logical concepts with
quantum mechanics. That this might be possible is shown here by defining truth,
validity, consistency, and completeness for a quantum mechanical version of a
simple classical expression enumeration machine described by Smullyan. It is
seen that for an interpretation based on a Feynman path sum over expression
path states, truth, consistency, and completeness have different properties
than for the classical system. For instance the truth of a sentence S is
defined only on the paths containing S. It is undefined elsewhere. Also S and
its negation can both be true provided they appear on separate paths. This
satisfies the definition of consistency. It is seen that validity and
completeness connect the system dynamics to the truth of the sentences. It is
proved that validity implies consistency. The requirements of validity and
maximal completeness strongly restrict the possible dynamics of the system.
Aspects of the existence of a valid, maximally complete dynamics are discussed.
An exponentially efficient quantum computer is described that is also valid and
complete.
