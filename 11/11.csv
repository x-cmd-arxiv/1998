upper and lower limits on microwave anisotropy from point sources over the

scales. We also derive an upper limit on microwave anisotropy caused by the
sources responsible for the Far-Infrared Background radiation detected in FIRAS

observations, although the actual contamination level is probably much lower.
This upper limit constrains the long-feared possibility of an undetected
population of sources with emission peaking near 100 GHz. Source detections
closer to 100 GHz are needed to improve our knowledge of galaxy evolution at
high redshift and to predict the level of point source confusion.

arcsec. A fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and its
positional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy strongly
suggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. This implies that the
B2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed by
another flat-spectrum radio source. Infrared images detect the lensed images of
the background source and the lensing galaxy. The lensed images have relative
positions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radio
wavelengths. Spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and a
source redshift of z_s=1.28. The image splitting and system redshifts imply
that the projected mass inside the Einstein radius of the lensing galaxy is
M_E=4.7x10^{11} h^{-1} M_sun. An estimate of the light emitted inside the
Einstein radius gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest frame B band of
(M/L_B)_E = 20 h (M/L_B)_sun. Both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higher
than what is seen in nearby Sa galaxies. In fact, the implied rotation velocity
for the lensing galaxy is two to three times higher than what is seen in nearby
spirals. The large projected mass inside the Einstein ring radius may be the
result of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from a
compact group of galaxies; however, it may also arise from a misidentification
of the source redshift. A simple model of the gravitational potential of the
lens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required to
satisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. With further
observations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of H_0.

the ionisation of hydrogen in the interstellar medium, in conjunction with the
assumption that the cosmological constant $\lambda$ is zero, requires these

can be derived if the solar neutrino deficit is energy dependent and if both it

seed. I show how the CMB perturbations manifestly reflect the symmetries of
their seeds. CMB anisotropies are obtained with a line of sight integration.
  This treatment highlights the undulatory properties of the CMB. I show with
numerical examples how the polarization and temperature perturbations propagate
beyond the size of their seeds, reaching the CMB sound horizon at the time
considered. Just like the waves from a pebble thrown in a pond, CMB anisotropy
from a seed intersecting the last scattering surface appears as a series of
temperature and polarization waves surrounding the seed, extending on the scale
of the CMB sound horizon at decoupling, roughly $1^{o}$ in the sky. Each wave
is characterized by its own value of the CMB perturbation, with the same mean
amplitude of the signal coming from the seed interior.

frequencies (about 20 or more), concentrated in three narrow and very crowded
regions near 475, 390 and 950 microHz in decreasing amplitude order. Most (if
not all) of the peaks in the latter region are linear combinations of the
high-amplitude frequencies between 455 and 500 microHz. If we divide the data
set into two equal parts, the power spectra are different. This is probably due
to a not sufficiently long (and therefore not completely resolved) light curve;

superadiabatic region at the top of convective envelopes and predict the
asymptotic value of the entropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified layers.
This information is translated into an effective mixing-length parameter alpha
suitable to construct standard stellar structure models. We validate the
approach by a detailed comparison to helioseismic data.
  The grid of RHD models for solar metallicity comprises 58 simulation runs
with a helium abundance of Y=0.28 in the range of effective temperatures 4300K
< Teff < 7100K and gravities 2.54 < logg < 4.74. We find a moderate,
nevertheless significant variation of alpha between about 1.3 for F-dwarfs and
1.75 for K-subgiants with a dominant dependence on Teff. In the close
neighbourhood of the Sun we find a plateau where alpha remains almost constant.
The internal accuracy of the calibration of alpha is estimated to be +/- 0.05
with a possible systematic bias towards lower values. An analogous calibration
of the convection theory of Canuto & Mazzitelli gives a different temperature
dependence but a similar variation of the free parameter.
  For the first time, values for the gravity-darkening exponent beta are

to obtain the spectrum of the deformed billiard for deformations so large as
the characteristic wave length. Then, for a specified time dependent shape
variation, the quantum dynamics of a particle inside the billiard is integrated
directly. In particular, the dispersion of the energy is studied in the
Bunimovich stadium billiard with oscillating boundary. The results showed that
the distribution of energy spreads diffusively for the first oscillations of
the boundary (${< \Delta^2 E}> =2 D t$). We studied the diffusion contant $D$
as a function of the boundary velocity and found differences with theoretical
predictions based on random matrix theory. By extracting highly phase space
localized structures from the spectrum, previous differences were reduced
significantly. This fact provides the first numerical evidence of the influence
of phase space localization on the quantum diffusion of a chaotic system.

tails at the asymptotic regions of timelike infinity, null infinity and along
the black-hole outer horizon (where the power-law behaviour is multiplied by an
oscillatory term caused by the dragging of reference frames). The damping
exponents characterizing the asymptotic solutions at timelike infinity and
along the black-hole outer horizon are independent of the spin parameter of the
fields. However, the damping exponents at future null infinity are spin
dependent. The late-time tails at all the three asymptotic regions are
spatially dependent on the spin parameter of the field. The rotational dragging
of reference frames, caused by the rotation of the black-hole (or star) leads
to an active coupling of different multipoles.

that a random compact metric space that is naturally associated to an infinite
family of coalescing Brownian motions on the circle has Hausdorff and packing
dimension both almost surely equal to 1/2 and, moreover, this space is capacity
equivalent to the middle--1/2 Cantor set (and hence also to the Brownian zero

an almost twilled pre-LR algebra, which is a true twilled LR-algebra iff the

in terms of certain associated differential (bi)graded Lie and
G(erstenhaber)-algebras; in particular, the G-algebra arising from an almost
complex structure is a d(ifferential) G-algebra iff the almost complex
structure is integrable. Such G-algebras, endowed with a generator turning them
into a B(atalin)-V(ilkovisky) algebra, occur on the B-side of the mirror

from twilled LR-algebras. A special case thereof explains the relationship
between holomorphic volume forms and exact generators for the corresponding
dG-algebras and thus yields in particular a conceptual proof of the
Tian-Todorov lemma. We give a differential homological algebra interpretation
for twilled LR-algebras and by means of it we elucidate the notion of generator

underlying quark model. First, branching ratios for radiative protonium
annihilation are calculated and compared with data. Then, details of the
isospin interference are studied for different models of the initial protonium
state and also for different kinematical form factors. The isospin interference
is shown to be uniquely connected to the $p\bar p - n\bar n $ mixing in the
