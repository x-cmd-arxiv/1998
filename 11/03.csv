  Our most important result to date is the detection of a fading counterpart to
GRB 980329 at 850 microns. Although it proved to be difficult to find the
infrared counterpart to this burst, the sub-millimeter flux was relatively
bright. This indicates that intrinsically the brightness of this counterpart
was very similar to GRB 970508. The radio through sub-millimeter spectrum of
GRB 980329 is well fit by a power law with index alpha = +0.9. However, we
cannot exclude a nu^(1/3) power law attenuated by synchrotron self-absorption.
An alpha = +1 VLA-SCUBA power law spectrum is definitely ruled out for GRB
980703, and possibly also for GRB 980519.
  We cannot rule out that part of the sub-millimeter flux from GRB 980329 comes
from a dusty star-forming galaxy at high redshift, such as the ones recently
discovered by SCUBA. Any quiescent dust contribution will be much larger at
sub-millimeter than at radio wavelengths. Both a high redshift and large dust
extinction would help explain the reddening of the counterpart to GRB 980329,

might then indicate that beaming is important.

rate of reconnection in a strongly magnetized plasma. This affects the rate of
reconnection by reducing the transverse scale for reconnection flows, and by
allowing many independent flux reconnection events to occur simultaneously.
Allowing only for the first effect and using Goldreich and Sridhar's model of
strong turbulence in a magnetized plasma with negligible intermittency, we find
that the lower limit for the reconnection speed is the Alfven speed times the
Lundquist number to the power (-3/16). The upper limit on the reconnection
speed is typically a large fraction of Alfven speed. We argue that generic
reconnection in turbulent plasmas will normally occur at close to this upper
limit. The fraction of magnetic energy that goes directly into electron heating
scales as Lundquist number to the power (-2/5) and the thickness of the current
sheet scales as the Lundquist number to the power (-3/5). A significant
fraction of the magnetic energy goes into high frequency Alfven waves. We claim
that the qualitative sense of these conclusions, that reconnection is fast even
though current sheets are narrow, is almost independent of the local physics of
reconnection and the nature of the turbulent cascade. As the consequence of
this the Galactic and Solar dynamos are generically fast, i.e. do not depend on
the plasma resistivity.

specified detection thresholds. We present computations of the lensing rates
and amplifications as functions of the event durations (weeks to years), for a
range of detection thresholds. We find that short events dominate the total

detection limit of K=17 mag, the total microlensing rate is 0.003 1/yr, and the
rate of events with durations >1 yr is 0.001 1/yr. Recent GC proper motion
studies have revealed the possible presence of one or two variable K-band
sources very close to SgrA* (Genzel et al 97; Ghez et al 98). These sources may
have attained peak brightnesses of K~15 mag, about 1.5-2 mag above the
observational detection limits, and appear to have varied on a timescale of ~1
yr. This behavior is consistent with long-duration microlensing of faint stars
by the BH. However, we estimate that the probability that such an event could

  Studies","Proceedings of Naramata Workshop, 5 pages",,,"CITA-98-55","astro-ph",,"  I review my work with Bruce Draine on dust emissivity at microwave
frequencies (3 cm - 3 mm). This emissivity explains the recently detected
""anomalous"" component of the galactic foreground emission. Both small (a<0.001
micron) and large grains contribute to this emission. Small grains have
electric dipole moments and emit while they rotate; the microwave emission of
large grains is mostly due to magneto-dipole radiation. Most efficient
magneto-dipole emitters are strongly magnetic, e.g. ferrimagnetic or
ferromagnetic, materials. The relative role of the two mechanisms can be
established through observations of microwave emissivity from dark clouds. New
microwave window is a window of opportunity for interstellar studies. Magnetic
fields inside dark clouds may be successfully studied via microwave
polarization. Microwave emissivity constrains the abundance of strongly
magnetic materials. For instance, the available data at 90 GHz indicate that
not more than 5% of interstellar Fe is in the form of metallic iron grains or
inclusions (e.g., in ``GEMS''). Future missions, e.g. MAP and PLANCK, will
bring a wealth of microwave data that can be successfully used to study ISM.
Such a study would be appreciated by cosmologists who franticly try to remove
all foregrounds from their data.

turbulence damped by ion-neutral friction, sustained cooling flow requires that
the outer gas be sufficiently turbulent, that the inner gas have marginal
field-neutral coupling, and that this coupling decrease sufficiently rapidly
with increasing density. These conditions are most likely met at the transition
between outer regions ionized primarily by UV photons and inner regions ionized
primarily by cosmic rays. If so, turbulent cooling flows can help form dense
cores, with speeds faster than expected for ambipolar diffusion. Such motions
could reduce the time needed for dense core formation and could precede and
enhance the motions of star-forming gravitational infall.

argue that the intergalactic medium (IGM) must have been heated through violent

supernova explosions, it likely proceeded in bursts which may be observable in
high redshift supernova searches. Within our model we reproduce the observed
cluster luminosity-temperature relation with energy injection of 1 keV/nucleon

observations have proved to be a powerful tool for identifying the physical
nature of the companion. Unfortunately, perhaps the most intriguing system
where such a tool could be used, a pulsar in orbit with a black hole, has yet
to be discovered. In this paper we give a detailed investigation of what one
can learn about the black hole companion via timing observations of the pulsar.
We present an analytic calculation for the propagation delay caused by the
frame-dragging effect and show that it has the same functional behavior as the
modulation of the observed rotational phase of the pulsar caused by the
deflection of the radio signals in the gravitational field of the companion
(bending delay). Thus, contrary to statements of other authors, the
frame-dragging delay is unlikely to be separately measurable in pulsar binaries
where the companion is a stellar mass black hole. We demonstrate, however, that
the precession of the binary orbit caused by the relativistic spin-orbit
coupling can lead to observable effects which can be used to set a lower limit
to the black-hole spin, or possibly allow the determination of its magnitude
and orientation. We give parameter estimates for two possible systems, a 10
solar mass black hole in orbit either with a young (~0.1 s) pulsar or with a
millisecond pulsar. Finally, we discuss the measurability of the quadrupole
moment of the rotating black hole companion which would test the presence of a
Kerr black hole. As an interesting side result of our calculations, we can give
a further argument why the companion of PSR J0045-7319 cannot be a Kerr black
hole.

symmetry, producing a divergent composite pair susceptibility. Secondary
screening channels couple to these divergent fluctuations, promoting an
instability into a state with long-range composite order. We present detailed a

interaction $J_2=y (1-\delta)$ by series expansions around the limit of
decoupled dimers ($\delta=1$). By extrapolating to $\delta=0$ and tuning $y$,
we study the critical point separating the power-law and spontaneously
dimerized phases of the spin-half antiferromagnet. We then focus on the
disorder line $y=0.5$, $0\le \delta\le 1$, where the ground states are known
exactly. We calculate the triplet excitation spectrum, their spectral weights
and wavevector dependent static susceptibility along this line. It is well
known that as $\delta \to 0$, the spin-gap is still non-zero but the triplets
are replaced by spinons as the elementary excitations. We study this dynamical
transition by analyzing the series for the spectral weight and the static
susceptibility. In particular, we show that the spectral weight for the
triplets vanishes and the static spin-susceptibility changes from a simple pole
at imaginary wavevectors to a branch cut at the transition.

nano-electronic devices appear most suitable for large-scale integration and
potential applications. We suggest to use low-capacitance Josephson junctions,
exploiting the coherence of tunneling in the superconducting state combined
with the possibility to control individual charges by Coulomb blockade effects
(cond-mat/9706016,cond-mat/9808067). These systems constitute quantum bits,
with logical states differing by one Cooper-pair charge. Single- and two-bit
operations can be performed by applying a sequence of gate voltages. The phase
coherence time is sufficiently long to allow a series of these steps. In
addition to the manipulation of qubits the resulting quantum state has to be
read out. This can be accomplished by coupling a single-electron transistor
capacitively to the qubit (cond-mat/9801125). To describe this quantum
measurement process we study the time evolution of the density matrix of the
coupled system. Only when a transport voltage is turned on, the transistor
destroys the phase coherence of the qubit; in this case within a short time.
The measurement is accomplished after a longer time scale, when the signal
resolves the different quantum states. At still longer times the measurement
process itself destroys the information about the initial state. We present a
suitable set of system parameters, which can be realized by present-day
technology.

propagation of light rays in the field of gravitational waves emitted by a
localized source of gravitational radiation is developed in the first
post-Minkowskian and quadrupole approximation of General Relativity. We
demonstrate that the equations of light propagation in the retarded
gravitational field of an arbitrary localized source emitting quadrupolar
gravitational waves can be integrated exactly. The influence of the
gravitational field on the light propagation is examined not only in the wave
zone but also in cases when light passes through the intermediate and near
zones of the source. Explicit analytic expressions for light deflection and
integrated time delay (Shapiro effect) are obtained accounting for all possible
retardation effects and arbitrary relative locations of the source of
gravitational waves, that of light rays, and the observer. It is shown that the
ADM and harmonic gauge conditions can both be satisfied simultaneously outside
the source of gravitational waves. Their use drastically simplifies the
integration of light propagation equations and those for the motion of light
source and observer in the field of the source of gravitational waves, leading
to the unique interpretation of observable effects. The two limiting cases of
small and large values of impact parameter are elaborated in more detail.
Explicit expressions for Shapiro effect and deflection angle are obtained in
terms of the transverse-traceless part of the space-space components of the
metric tensor. We also discuss the relevance of the developed formalism for
interpretation of radio interferometric and timing observations, as well as for
data processing algorithms for future gravitational wave detectors.

field systems which are nonequivalent with respect to the Bogolubov

problem of ambiguity pertains equally both to quantum and classical fields. The
canonical theory is advanced, which is based on a canonical, or natural choice
of field modes. The principal characteristic feature of the theory is
relativistic-gravitational nonlocality: The field at a spacetime point $(s,t)$
depends on the metric at $t$ in the whole 3-space. The most fundamental and
shocking result is the following: In the case of a free field in curved
spacetime, there is no particle creation. Applications to cosmology and black
holes are given. The results for particle energies are in complete agreement

pictures are equivalent. In this work, after calculating $T$ als well as the

from deep-inelastic scattering on charmed quarks at large x. The resulting
admixture of the Fock states, containing charmed quarks in the decomposition of

The theory can be thought of as a topological phase of Hamiltonian mechanics

N=2 supersymmetry, which is identified with an exterior algebra.

can be trapped in the focal plane of a Gaussian beam. A particle can absorb
energy from such a beam with a large radial intensity gradient, resulting in
substantial temperature gradients and a radiometric torque which causes it to
spin rapidly about an axis perpendicular to the flux of radiant energy. The
particles are also observed to orbit around the optical axis. Here we
investigate the fundamental physics of this system, the Radiometric Particle
Trap, and discuss its force laws using gas-kinetic theory.

system with a closed loop of coherent couplings (loop-STIRAP) is not equivalent
to an adiabatic rotation of the dark-state of the Hamiltonian but coresponds to
a rotation of a higher-order trapping state in a generalized adiabatic basis.
The concept of generalized adiabatic basis sets is used as a constructive tool
to design pulse sequences for stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) which
give maximum population transfer also under conditions when the usual condition
of adiabaticty is only poorly fulfilled. Under certain conditions for the
pulses (generalized matched pulses) there exists a higher-order trapping state,
which is an exact constant of motion and analytic solutions for the atomic
dynamics can be derived.
