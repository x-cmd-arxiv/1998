variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al.
(1998) to present evidence that CVs 1--4 all have faint disks and probably low
accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the
published spectra of Grindlay et al. (1995) we present new evidence that CVs
1--3 may be DQ Her systems, and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or
another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae
in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a
member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do
not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as ``non-flickerers'' (NFs).
Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the
cluster center. Using stellar atmosphere models we have determined log g =
6.25, and T_eff = 17,500 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the
luminosity of the NF we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium
WD having a mass of ~0.25 solar masses and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr
(depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly
Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a
dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen WD.

of the 11 sources display deviations from `standard double radio source'
morphologies, with multiple hotspots or a hotspot withdrawn from the leading
edge of the radio emission. The sources are typically polarised at the 5 to 15%
level. The mean rotation measures of the individual lobes are less than 50
rad/m^2 but strong asymmetries between the two lobes indicate that the Faraday
rotation does not have a Milky Way origin; rather, the distant 6C radio sources
lie in a relatively dense clumpy environment. The sources are compared with the
more radio powerful distant 3CR radio galaxies and with low redshift sources.
The ratio of core to extended radio flux is almost independent of the radio
source size and only weakly inversely correlated with the total radio power.
This indicates that the high radio luminosity of the most powerful radio
sources must originate in the AGN, in contrast to the suggestion that they are
so luminous only due to confinement by a dense surrounding environment.

errors and computed at the redshift of the group) is sigma_{ESP,median} = 194
km/s. We show that our result is reliable in spite of the particular geometry
of the ESP survey (two rows of tangent circular fields of radius 15 arcmin),
which causes most systems to be only partially surveyed. In general, we find
that the properties of ESP groups are consistent with those of groups in
shallower (and wider) catalogs (e.g. CfA2N and SSRS2). As in shallower
catalogs, ESP groups trace very well the geometry of the large scale structure.
Our results are of particular interest because the depth of the ESP survey
allows us to sample group properties over a large number of structures. We also
compare luminosity function and spectral properties of galaxies that are
members of groups with those of isolated galaxies. We find that galaxies in
groups have a brighter M* with respect to non--member galaxies; the slope
\alpha is the same, within the errors, in the two cases. We find that 34% of
ESP galaxies with detectable emission lines are members of groups. The fraction
of galaxies without detectable emission lines in groups is significantly
higher: 45%. More generally, we find a gradual decrease of the fraction of
emission line galaxies among members of systems of increasing richness. This
result confirms that the morphology-density relation found for clusters also
extends toward systems of lower density.

10^{-2} Mo\odot which is concentrated near the equatorial plane. This
intermediate wind was formed during the few orbital periods when a binary
companion entered the envelope of the progenitor of SN 1987a, when the latter
was a red supergiant. The intermediate wind formed a hollowed torus with a
horseshoe-shaped cross section. The inner regions at the ends of the horseshoe
torus are the two outer rings of SN 1987A. The other regions of the torus were
cleaned by the fast wind blown after the progenitor turns into a blue giant.
The proposed scenario accounts for: (i) slow motion of the outer rings; (ii)
the high density contrast of the outer rings to their surroundings; (iii) the
presence of only two outer rings; (iv) the displacement of the rings relative
to the central star; (v) the fact that no planetary nebulae have been observed
to have a single pair of outer rings.

  by ASP, editor G. Ferland ; Few minor style changes",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a new scheme for modeling the broad line region in active galactic
nuclei. It involves photoionization calculations applied to a number of
variable emission lines at {\it all times}. We demonstrate how fitting all
lines simultaneously provide strong constraints on several of the more
important parameters, such as the density and column density, and the radial
distribution of the emission line clouds.
  When applying the model to the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548, we are able to
reconstruct the light curves of four emission-lines, in time and in absolute
flux. We argue that the Balmer line light curves, and possibly also the MgII
light curve, do not fit this scheme because of the limitations of present-day
photoionization codes. We rule out models where the particle density scales as
r^{-2} and favor models where it scales as r^{-(1-1.5)}. We can place lower
limits on the column density at a distance of 10 ld, of N_{col}(r=10)>10^{22}
cm^{-2}, and limit the particle density to be in the range of
10^{11}>N(r=10)>10^{9.5} cm^{-3}.

blazars allow us to elucidate the physics of extragalactic jets, and,
ultimately, how energy is extracted from the central black hole. Crucial
information about jet structure is provided by the spectral energy
distributions from radio to gamma-rays, their trends with luminosity, and
correlated multifrequency variability. Since blazar jets have broad
implications for all radio-loud (and possibly radio-quiet) AGNs, we also need
to understand their circumnuclear structure, especially the details of the
physical and dynamical conditions of the highly ionized gas on sub-pc scales,
which could be directly related to jet formation and radiative power.
Eventually, the bulk of information provided by blazars will help us clarify
the origin of the radio-loud/radio-quiet AGN dichotomy, one of the most
outstanding open issues of extragalactic astrophysics.

some systems exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion, i.e. $<|x(t)|^q> \sim t^{q
\nu(q)}$ where $\nu(2)>1/2$ and $q \nu(q)$ is not a linear function of $q$.
This feature is different from the weak superdiffusion regime, i.e.
$\nu(q)=const > 1/2$, as in random shear flows. The strong anomalous diffusion
can be generated by nontrivial chaotic dynamics, e.g. Lagrangian motion in $2d$
time-dependent incompressible velocity fields, $2d$ symplectic maps and $1d$
intermittent maps. Typically the function $q \nu(q)$ is piecewise linear. This
corresponds to two mechanisms: a weak anomalous diffusion for the typical
events and a ballistic transport for the rare excursions. In order to have
strong anomalous diffusion one needs a violation of the hypothesis of the
central limit theorem, this happens only in a very narrow region of the control
parameters space.

  (Symposium proceedings to be published by World Scientific PC)",,,,"hep-ph",,"  A whole class of non-perturbative QCD studies, e.g. the instanton models,
chiral quark models, etc. indicates that the effective degrees of freedom for
the physics in the low Q^(2) < 1 GeV^(2) region could be the constituent quarks
(CQs) and internal Goldstone bosons (IGBs). This leads to a nucleon structure
with the spin being carried by three constituent quark systems, each composed
of a massive compact CQ surrounded by a q\bar{q} sea perturbatively generated
by the valence quark's IGB emissions. Such a CQ-system has a total angular
momentum of 1/2 and a small anomalous magnetic moment, built up from a
quark-spin polarization and a significant orbital motion in the quark sea. The
distinctive phenomenological signal for such a non-perturbative structure is
that the sea-quarks are polarized negatively, while the antiquarks are not
polarized. This picture also suggests a negligibly small gluon polarization.
All such features can be tested by experiments in the near future.

investigated using the path integral, on the sphere, in the large radius limit.
The general form of the $N$-point functions of vertex operators is found and
the three-point function is derived explicitly. In previous work it was
inferred that the three-point function should possess a two-dimensional lattice
of poles in the parameter space (as opposed to a one-dimensional lattice one
would expect from the standard Liouville potential). Here we argue that the
two-dimensionality of the lattice has its origin in the duality of the quantum
mechanical Liouville states and we incorporate this duality into the path
integral by using a two-exponential potential. Contrary to what one might
expect, this does not violate conformal invariance; and has the great advantage
of producing the two-dimensional lattice in a natural way.

proven and detailed in forthcoming papers. When one studies families of objects
over curves, and the objects are parametrized by a Deligne-Mumford stack M,
then the families are equivalent to morphisms of curves into M. In order to
have complete moduli for such families, one needs to compactify the stack of
stable maps into M. It turns out that in the boundary, the curve must acquire
extra structure and you'd better read the paper to see what that structure is.
  Applications to fibered surfaces (see math.AG/9804097), admissible covers,

of the recently introduced quasi-Hopf superalgebras (QHSAs), which play a

introduce the opposite structure and prove in detail (for the graded case)
Drinfeld's result that the coproduct $\Delta ' \equiv (S\otimes S)\cdot T\cdot
\Delta \cdot S^{-1}$ induced on a QHSA is obtained from the coproduct $\Delta$
by twisting. The corresponding ``Drinfeld twist'' $F_D$ is explicitly
constructed, as well as its inverse, and we investigate the complete QHSA
associated with $\Delta'$. We give a universal proof that the coassociator
$\Phi'=(S\otimes S\otimes S)\Phi_{321}$ and canonical elements $\alpha' =
S(\beta),$ $\beta' = S(\alpha)$ correspond to twisting the original
coassociator $\Phi = \Phi_{123}$ and canonical elements $\alpha,\beta$ with the
Drinfeld twist $F_D$. Moreover in the quasi-triangular case, it is shown
algebraically that the R-matrix $R' = (S\otimes S)R$ corresponds to twisting
the original R-matrix $R$ with $F_D$. This has important consequences in knot
theory, which will be investigated elsewhere.
