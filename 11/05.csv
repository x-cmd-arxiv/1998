  http://www.maths.qmw.ac.uk/~eoc",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We study the changes in the dynamical behaviour of axisymmetric spherical
mean-field dynamo models produced by changes in their geometry and topology, by
considering a two parameter family of models, ranging from a full sphere to
spherical shell, torus and disc-like configurations, within a unified
framework. We find that the two parameter space of the family of models
considered here separates into at least three different regions with distinct
characteristics for the onset of dynamo action. In two of these regions, the
most easily excited fields are oscillatory, in one case with dipolar symmetry,
and in the other with quadrupolar, whereas in the third region the most easily
excited field is steady and quadrupolar. In the nonlinear regime, we find that
topological changes can alter significantly the dynamical behaviour, whilst
modest changes in geometry can produce qualitative changes, particularly for
thin disc-like configurations. This is of potential importance, since the exact
shapes of astrophysical bodies, especially accretion discs and galaxies, are
usually not precisely known.

the ASCA and ROSAT spectra of NGC 1399, NGC 4472, NGC 4636, and NGC 5044.
Broad-band spectral fitting of the ASCA SIS and GIS data accumulated within a
radius of ~5 arcmin for each galaxy shows that isothermal models are unable to
fit the SIS data near 1 keV. In addition, these isothermal models typically
fail to produce the large equivalent widths of the K-alpha line blends of the
H-like and He-like ions of Si and S which are measured independently of the Fe
L emission lines. Two-temperature models provide excellent broad-band fits to
both the SIS and GIS data of each galaxy with the relative abundances (except
for NGC 4636) fixed at their solar values. A simple multiphase cooling flow
model fits nearly as well as the two-temperature model for NGC 1399, NGC 4472,
and NGC 5044. The multiphase models also predict more accurately the Si and S
equivalent widths and the ratios of Si XIV/XIII and S XVI/XV than the
isothermal models.
  Using various approaches we find that the temperature gradients inferred from
the ROSAT PSPC data of these galaxies, especially for NGC 1399 and NGC 5044,
are inconsistent with the isothermal models derived from fitting the ASCA data
within a single-aperture but are very consistent with the multiphase models.
Therefore, models which assume isothermal gas within r ~5 arcmin are
inconsistent with both the ASCA and ROSAT PSPC data of these elliptical
galaxies. Simple two-temperature models and multiphase cooling flows provide
good descriptions of these data sets with Fe abundances of ~1-2 solar and
(except for NGC 4636) relative abundances fixed at their solar values. We
discuss the implications of these nearly solar abundances. (Abridged)

Typically, object detection is performed in one of the available bands or on a
somewhat arbitrarily co-added image. Our technique provides an almost optimal
way to use all the color information available. We build up a composite image
of the N passbands where each pixel value corresponds to the probability that
the given pixel is just sky. By knowing the probability distribution of sky
pixels (a chi-square distribution with N degrees of freedom), the data can be
used to derive the distribution of pixels dominated by object flux. From the
two distributions an optimal segmentation threshold can be determined. Clipping
the probability image at this threshold yields a mask, where pixels unlikely to
be sky are tagged. After using a standard connected-pixel criterion, the
regions of this mask define the detected objects. Applying this technique to
the Hubble Deep Field data, we find that we can extend the detection limit of
the data below that possible using linearly co-added images. We also discuss
possible ways of enhancing object detection probabilities for certain well
defined classes of objects by using various optimized linear combinations of
the pixel fluxes (optimal subspace filtering).

masses. The opaque western portion that was mapped in this study has a mass of
about 10E3 solar masses, contains a number of embedded infrared sources and
various compact 1.3 mm continuum sources, and has a remarkable filamentary
structure with numerous cavities which appears to be the fossil remnants of
past star formation activity. The profusion of outflows in this region are
disentangled and linked to driving IRAS sources. Thus, the mapped portion of
Circinus contains at least 10 CO emitting molecular outflows. Assuming that
star formation has continued at a steady rate for the last several hundred
thousand years, the Circinus cloud is expected to have produced dozens of young
stars. Their outflows have severely altered the structure and kinematics of
this cloud as evidenced by the multitude of prominent cavities and dust
filaments that outline their boundaries. This level of star formation activity
is consistent with the numerous post-outflow phase H-alpha emission line stars
that have been found in this region. The Circinus cloud complex is an
archetypical case where star formation activity may have profoundly affected
the structure of a molecular cloud, producing its strikingly filamentary and
cavitated appearance and providing further evidence that star formation may be
a self regulated process.

the variation in the equivalent widths of lines showing the Baldwin effect, it

with intrinsic scatter of 0.016 mag in Mgb' and 0.023 mag in Mg2. The zeropoint
for cD galaxies is higher than for E/S0 galaxies, implying cDs are older and/or
more metal-rich than E/S0s with the same sigma. Mg-sigma zeropoint variations
between clusters are consistent with the number of galaxies observed per
cluster and the global intrinsic scatter in Mg-sigma. We find no significant
correlation between the Mg-sigma zeropoint and the cluster velocity dispersion,
X-ray luminosity or X-ray temperature over a wide range in cluster mass. We
compare the intrinsic scatter in the Mg-sigma and Fundamental Plane (FP)
relations with stellar population models to constrain the dispersion in ages,
metallicities and M/L ratios for early-type galaxies at fixed sigma. Variations
in age alone or metallicity alone cannot explain the measured intrinsic scatter
in both Mg-sigma and the FP. We derive the joint constraints on the dispersion
in age and metallicity implied by the scatter in the Mg-sigma and FP relations
for a simple Gaussian model. We find upper limits on the dispersions at fixed
sigma of 32% in dt/t and 38% in dZ/Z if variations in age and metallicity are
uncorrelated; only strongly anti-correlated variations lead to significantly
higher upper limits. The joint distribution of residuals from the Mg-sigma and

find from the detected decrement (2.60 +/- 0.79) ~ 10^{-4}, which is consistent
with that computed using the X-ray (ROSAT and ASCA) observations. The
uncertainty includes contributions due to statistical uncertainty in the
detection and systematics and calibration. The 1.2 {mm} channel data alone
gives rise to a larger Comptonization parameter and this result is discussed in
terms of contamination from foreground sources and/or dust in the cluster or
from a possible systematic effect. We then make use of the combined analysis of
the ROSAT and ASCA X-ray satellite observations to determine an isothermal
model for the S-Z surface brightness. Since the cluster is asymmetrical and
probably in a merging process, models are only approximate. The associated
uncertainty can, however, be estimated by exploring a set of alternative
models. We then find as the global uncertainty on the Comptonization parameter
a factor of 1.3. Combining the S-Z and the X-ray measurements, we determine a

competitive effects due to the polaron formation are found to be important: (i)
the screening of the Coulomb force, which destabilizes the crystal, compensated
by (ii) the increase of the carrier mass (polaron mass). The competition
between the two effects is carefully studied, and the quantum melting of the
polaronic Wigner crystal is examined by varying the density at zero
temperature. By calculating the quantum fluctuations of both the electron and
the polarization, we show that there is a competition between the dissociation
of the polarons at the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT), and a melting
towards a polaron liquid. We find that at strong coupling, a liquid state of
dielectric polarons cannot exist, and the IMT is driven by the polaron
dissociation. Next, taking into account the dipolar interactions between
localized carriers, we show that these are responsible for an instability of
the transverse vibrational modes of the polaronic Wigner crystal as the density
increases. This provides a new mechanism for the IMT in doped dielectrics,
which yields interesting dielectric properties below and beyond the transition.
An optical signature of such a mechanism for the IMT is provided.

technical details. The goal of the lectures is to provide a bridge between
textbooks on classical critical phenomena and the current literature on quantum
phase transitions. Some familiarity with the concepts of classical phase
transitions is helpful, but not absolutely necessary.

reservoirs. By taking the doping of the injecting contacts and the applied
voltage as variable parameters, the influence of elastic and inelastic

analyzed and discussed. Provided significant space-charge effects take place

continuously changing fractal dimension as temperature is varied, and report an
evidence of a novel phase transition at zero temperature in absence of an

As standard models for such systems, the SU(N)xSU(M) Anderson impurity models
exhibit both Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid behavior, depending on their
symmetry. Taking the Anderson model as an example, these lectures first give an
introduction to the auxiliary boson method to describe correlated systems
governed by a strong, short-range electronic repulsion. It is then shown how to
include the relevant low-lying excitations (coherent spin flip and charge
fluctuation processes), while preserving the local gauge symmetry of the model.
This amounts to a conserving T-matrix approximation (CTMA). We prove a
cancellation theorem showing that the CTMA incorporates all leading and
subleading infrared singularities at any given order in a self-consistent loop
expansion of the free energy. As a result, the CTMA recovers the correct
infrared behavior of the auxiliary particle propagators, indicating that it
correctly describes both the Fermi and the non-Fermi regimes of the Anderson
model.

QCD and electroweak penguin corrections to a_1 from $B\to D^{(*)}D_s^{(*)}$ and
a_2 from $B\to J/\psi K^{(*)}$ are estimated. In addition to the
model-dependent determination, the effective coefficient a_1 is also extracted

factorization to the measured semileptonic distribution of $B\to D^{(*)}\ell
\bar\nu$ at $q^2=m_h^2$. Moreover, this enables us to extract model-independent
heavy-to-heavy form factors, for example,
$F_0^{BD}(m_\pi^2)=0.66\pm0.06\pm0.05$ and
$A_0^{BD^*}(m_\pi^2)=0.56\pm0.03\pm0.04$. The determination of the magnitude of
a_2 from $B\to J/\psi K^{(*)}$ depends on the form factors $F_1^{BK}$,
$A_{1,2}^{BK^*}$ and $V^{BK^*}$ at $q^2=m^2_{J/\psi}$. By requiring that a_2 be
process insensitive (i.e., the value of a_2 extracted from $J/\psi K$ and
$J/\psi K^*$ states should be similar), as implied by the factorization
hypothesis, we find that $B\to K^{(*)}$ form factors are severely constrained;
they respect the relation $F_1^{BK}(m^2_{J/\psi})\approx 1.9
A_1^{BK^*}(m^2_{J/\psi})$. Form factors $A_2^{BK^*}$ and $V^{BK^*}$ at
$q^2=m^2_{J/\psi}$ inferred from the measurements of the longitudinal
polarization fraction and the P-wave component in $B\to J/\psi K^*$ are
obtained. A stringent upper limit on a_2 is derived from the current bound on

differences between longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions and
provides absolute values for all computed differential cross sections. We give

p-wave content is about 40%. A p-resonance, consistent with measurements at
about 0.5 MeV of width about 0.4 MeV, seems to be necessary. The widths of the

tendency to increase towards lower energies. The transverse momentum
distributions are broader than the longitudinal due to the diffraction process.
