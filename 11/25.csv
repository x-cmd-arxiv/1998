possible forms of these trends, such as limits on the rate at which extinction

supergiant H II regions to derive C and Si abundances in a subsample of 7 BCGs.
The main result of the present study is that none of the heavy
element-to-oxygen abundance ratios studied here (C/O, N/O, Ne/O, Si/O, S/O,
Ar/O, Fe/O) depend on oxygen abundance for BCGs with 12 + log O/H < 7.6 (Z <
Zsun/20). This constancy implies that all these heavy elements have a primary
origin and are produced by the same massive (M > 10Msun) stars responsible for
O production. The dispersion of the C/O and N/O ratios in these galaxies is
found to be remarkably small, being only +/-0.03 dex and +/-0.02 dex
respectively. This very small dispersion is strong evidence against any
time-delayed production of C and primary N in the lowest-metallicity BCGs
(secondary N production is negligible at these low metallicities). The absence
of a time-delayed production of C and N is consistent with the scenario that
galaxies with 12 + log O/H < 7.6 are undergoing now their first burst of star
formation, and that they are therefore young, with ages not exceeding 40 Myr.
If very low metallicities BCGs are indeed young, this would argue against the
commonly held belief that C and N are produced by intermediate-mass (3Msun < M
< 9Msun) stars at very low metallicities, as these stars would not have yet
completed their evolution in these lowest metallicity galaxies.

early universe by 30 orders of magnitude compared to its presently observed

breaking of local Lorentz invariance in the early Universe, associated with a
first order phase transition at a critical time $t=t_c$. This solves the
horizon problem, leads to a mechanism of monopole suppression in cosmology and
can resolve the flatness problem. it also offers the potential of solving the
cosmological constant problem. After the critical time $t_c$, local Lorentz
invariance is restored and light travels at its presently measured speed. We
investigate the field equations in the spontaneously broken phase and study
further the flatness problem and the cosmological constant problem. The entropy
is shown to undergo a large increase as the light velocity goes through a phase
transition. A scale invariant prediction for microwave background fluctuations
originating at the time of the phase transition is discussed.

measure the relative proper motion of the lens to the source, and so those
caused by binary MACHOs are of great importance for understanding the structure
of the Galactic halo and the nature of MACHOs. The microlensing event
98-SMC-01, occurred in June 1998, is the first event for which the proper
motion is ever measured through the caustic crossing, and this event may be
caused by binary MACHOs as we argue in this Letter. Motivated by the possible
existence of binary MACHOs, we have performed the Monte Carlo simulations of
caustic crossing events by binary MACHOs and investigated the properties and
detectability of the events. Our calculation shows that typical caustic
crossing events have the interval between two caustic crossings ($t_{\rm cc}$)
of about 5 days. We argue that with the current strategy of binary event search
the proper motions of these typical events are not measurable because of the
short time scale. Therefore the proper motion distribution measured from
caustic crossing events suffers significantly from {`}time scale bias{'}, which
is a bias toward finding long time scale events and hence slowly moving lenses.
We predict there are two times more short time scale events ($t_{\rm cc}\le 10$
days) than long time scale events ($t_{\rm cc}\ge 10$ days), and propose an
hourly monitoring observation instead of the nightly monitoring currently
undertaken to detect caustic crossing events by binary MACHOs more efficiently.

survey for Lyman break galaxies at smaller redshift (2.7 < z < 3.4) allows a
relatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integrated
luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. Over the same range of UV
luminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z~4 and z~3
are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the total
integrated UV luminosity densities (rho_{UV}(z=3)/rho_{UV}(z=4) = 1.1 +/-0.3).
We see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star
formation density inferred from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the
Hubble Deep Field (HDF). If the true luminosity density at z~4 is somewhat
higher than implied by the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the
emissivity of star formation as a function of redshift is essentially constant

suggests that there is no obvious peak in star formation activity, and that the

observation and interpretation of the ``evolution of clustering''. It is likely
that results from the first attempts to characterize galaxy clustering beyond
the ``local'' universe have been significantly limited by sample variance, as
the difficulty in assembling large samples over large volumes is exacerbated as
the observations become more challenging. It is also argued that, because of
the complicated relationship between galaxies and mass (i.e., bias), and the
surprising degeneracies among different popular cosmological models, it is
likely that studies of galaxy clustering as a function of cosmic epoch will
never be useful for strong discrimination between different cosmological
models. On the other hand, observations of galaxy clustering are capable of
testing basic ideas about how (and where) galaxies form. Galaxy formation, as
opposed to cosmography, will probably remain a fundamental question even beyond
the MAP and Planck era.

quasi-periodic obscuration of the central X-ray source by a structure in the

consistent with the fact that 4U 1323-62 is a dipping source. The
quasi-periodic obscuration could take place by partial covering of an extended
central X-ray source by a near-opaque medium, or by covering of a point source
by a medium of suitable characteristics to produce the relatively

PSPC X-ray sources brighter than 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} were searched for
red (O-E > 2.0, O < 20) counterparts in the APM catalog of Palomar Sky Survey

spectroscopy, we have found 7 red quasars, 5 with alpha(opt) < -2. Their
redshifts range from 0.06 to 0.31, and their luminosities are moderate, lying
on the Seyfert/Quasar boundary. These red quasars strengthen the case for a
radio-quiet population that is the counterpart of the radio-loud red quasars
found by Smith and Spinrad (1980), and Webster et al. (1995). Unidentified,
fainter, sources could increase the fraction of red quasars by up to a factor
7.
  For the red quasars found here, the H-alpha/H-beta ratios, optical slope and
X-ray colors all indicate that they are absorbed by A(V) ~ 2, rather than
having intrinsically red spectra. This amount of obscuration seems to hide
~1-7% of quasars at a given observed flux, or ~3-20% when their fluxes are
corrected to their intrinsic values. This size of population is consistent with
earlier limits, with predicted values from Comastri et al. (1995), and is
comparable to the rate found among radio-loud quasars.
  A large population of more heavily absorbed (A(V)=5), fainter, quasars equal

unified models for FR I radio sources and BL Lac objects. The detection of
extended dust discs in some radio galaxies provides information on their jet
orientation. Given this, the strength of the compact nuclear sources of FR I
and BL Lacs can be compared with model predictions. As a pilot project, we
selected five radio galaxies which show extended nuclear discs in the HST
images. The relative orientation of the projected radio-jets and of the
extended nuclear discs indicates that they are not perpendicular, as the
simplest geometrical model would suggest, but that they form an angle of ~ 20 -
40 degrees with the symmetry axis of the disc: a significant change of
orientation occurs between the innermost AGN structure and the kpc-scale.
Nevertheless, the discs appear to be useful indicators of the radio sources
orientation since the angles formed by the disc axis and the jet with the line
of sight differ by only ~ 10 - 20 degrees. At the center of each disc an
unresolved nuclear source is present. We compared its luminosity with the
optical core luminosity of BL Lacs selected for having similar host galaxy
magnitude and extended radio luminosity. The BL Lac cores are between 2 E2 and
3 E5 times brighter than the corresponding radio galaxies ones. The FR I/BL Lac
core luminosity ratio shows a suggestive correlation with the orientation of
the radio galaxies with respect to the line of sight. The behavior of this
ratio is quantitatively consistent with a scenario in which the emission in the
FR I and BL Lac is dominated by the beamed radiation from a relativistic jet
with Doppler factor ~ 5 - 10, thus supporting the basic features of the
proposed unification schemes.

The DVR is efficient for problems where the interaction potential may be
expressed as a local function of interparticle coordinates. In order to address
condensates that are both very large (millions of atoms) and fully anisotropic,
the ground state is found using a self-consistent field approach. Experience
has demonstrated, however, that standard iterative techniques applied to the
solution of the non-linear partial differential equation for the condensate are
non-convergent. This limitation is overcome using the method of direct
inversion in the iterated subspace (DIIS). In addition, the sparse structure of
the DVR enables the efficient application of iterative techniques such as the
Davidson and/or Lanczos methods, to extract the eigenvalues of physical
interest. The results are compared with recent experimental data obtained for
Bose-Einstein condensed alkali metal vapors confined in magnetic traps.

gain in kinetic energy. A signature of this class of mechanisms is that a
transfer of spectral weight in optical absorption from high to low frequencies
occurs upon spin polarization. We show that such models arise from generalized

conformations which are particularly stable when their energy is minimized with
respect to amino acid sequence (in the sense that they display a large energy
gap to the lowest structrally dissimilar conformation), aside from leading to
fast folding, are highly designable (in the sense that many sequences target
onto it in the folding process). These results are quite general, do not depend
on the particular simmetries displayed by the compact conformation chosen as
native, and can be obtained making use of a large class of contact energies. On
the other hand, the design of sequences which fold onto native conformations
displaying secondary structures and eventually tertiary simmetries, is a
difficult task requiring a delicate tuning of the contact energies.

Hubbard model at half-filling using the moment approach of Nolting. Our
starting point is a self-energy, $\Sigma(\vec{k},\omega)$, which has a single
pole, $\Omega(\vec{k})$, with {\it spectral} weight, $\alpha(\vec{k})$, and
quasi-particle lifetime, $\gamma(\vec{k})$. In our approach,
$\Sigma(\vec{k},\omega)$ becomes the central feature of the many-body problem
and due to three unkown $\vec{k}$-parameters we have to satisfy only the first
three sum rules instead of four as in the canonical formulation of Nolting.
This self-energy choice forces our system to be a non-Fermi liquid for any
value of the interaction, since it does not vanish at zero frequency. The
one-particle Green function, $G(\vec{k},\omega)$, shows the finger-print of a
strongly correlated system, i.e., a double peak structure in the one-particle
spectral density, $A(\vec{k},\omega)$, vs $\omega$ for intermediate values of
the interaction. Close to the Mott Insulator-Transition, $A(\vec{k},\omega)$,
becomes a wide single peak, signaling the absence of quasi-particles.

phase transition to a poisoned state at y_1 (y_2). This is in qualitative
agreement with simulation for the triangular lattice, where our theory gives a
rather accurate prediction for y_2. To obtain the correct phase diagram for the
square lattice, i.e., no active state, we reformulate the PA using sublattices.
The (formerly) active regime is then replaced by a poisoned state with broken
symmetry (unequal sub- lattice coverages), as observed recently by Kortluke et
al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 275, 85 (1997)]. In contrast with their approach, in
which the active state persists, although reduced in extent, we report here the
first qualitatively correct theory of the NO+CO model on the square lattice.
Surface diffusion of nitrogen can lead to an active state in this case. In one
dimension, the PA predicts that diffusion is required for the existence of an
active state.

\epsilon^\prime/\epsilon \le 2 \cdot 10^{-3}$ and Standard Model values for the

Colangelo and Isidori, using $\epsilon$ instead of $\epsilon^\prime/\epsilon$).
We illustrate how these bounds can be improved with the help of the forthcoming

\nu)$ and the short distance contribution to ${\rm BR}(K_L \to \mu^+ \mu^-)$.
We also discuss new physics scenarios in which in addition to an enhanced $\bar
s d Z$ vertex also neutral meson mixing receives important new contributions.
In this case larger values of the branching ratios in question cannot be

obtained in terms of a mixed Weyl symbol calculus. The basic ingredient in the
collision--broadened line shape theory is the time dependent dipole
autocorrelation function of the radiator-perturber system. The observed
spectral intensity is the Fourier transform of this correlation function. A
modified form of the Wigner--Weyl isomorphism between quantum operators and
phase space functions (Weyl symbols) is introduced in order to describe the
quantum structure of this system. This modification uses a partial Wigner
transform in which the radiator-perturber relative motion degrees of freedom
are transformed into a phase space dependence, while operators associated with
the internal molecular degrees of freedom are kept in their original Hilbert
space form. The result of this partial Wigner transform is called a mixed Weyl
symbol. The star product, Moyal bracket and asymptotic expansions native to the
mixed Weyl symbol calculus are determined. The correlation function is
represented as the phase space integral of the product of two mixed symbols:
one corresponding to the initial configuration of the system, the other being
its time evolving dynamical value. There are, in this approach, two
semiclassical expansions -- one associated with the perturber scattering
process, the other with the mixed symbol star product. These approximations are
used in combination to obtain representations of the autocorrelation that are
sufficiently simple to allow numerical calculation. The leading O(\hbar^0)
approximation recovers the standard classical path approximation for line
shapes. The higher order O(\hbar^1) corrections arise from the noncommutative
nature of the star product.

appreciable deviations from the Landau-Zener probability $P_{LZ}$ are found to
appear for large couplings only, when $P$ is very small; this explains why the
Landau-Zener model is often seen to provide more accurate results than
expected. In the second type of nonlinearity, called {\it essential}
nonlinearity, the detuning is proportional to an odd power of time. Then the
nonadiabatic probability $P$ is qualitatively and quantitatively different from
$P_{LZ}$ because on the one hand, it vanishes in an oscillatory manner as the
coupling increases, and on the other, it is much larger than $P_{LZ}$. We
suggest an experimental situation when this deviation can be observed.
