diffuse light that stretch for over 100 kpc, yet are just a few kpc wide. At a
surface brightness of m_b \sim 27-28th arcsec^-2, the Centaurus arc is the most
striking example known of structure in the diffuse light component of a rich
galaxy cluster. We use numerical simulations to show that the Centaurus feature
can be reproduced by the tidal debris of a spiral galaxy that has been tidally
disrupted by the gravitational potential of NGC 4709. The surface brightness
and narrow dimensions of the diffuse light suggest that the disk was
co-rotating with its orbital path past pericentre. Features this prominent in
clusters will be relatively rare, although at fainter surface brightness levels
the diffuse light will reveal a wealth of structure. Deeper imaging surveys may
be able to trace this feature for several times its presently observed extent
and somewhere along the tidal debris, a fraction of the original stellar
component of the disk will remain bound, but transformed into a faint
spheroidal galaxy. It should be possible to confirm the galactic origin of the
Centaurus arc by observing planetary nebulae along its length with redshifts
close to that of NGC 4709.

G39.2-0.3 has been sometimes characterized as a shell-like remnant in the
literature but our high-energy imaging and spectral analysis show the
unambiguous composite nature of the remnant. We find that part of the
contribution to G39.2-0.3's X-ray emission is distinctly non-thermal, best
described by a power law with a photon index ($2.53^{\rm +0.34}_{\rm -0.27}$).
The region of emission is consistent with a point source (extension consistent
with the point spread function of the detector at the off-axis angle of the
observation) and is roughly defined by a circle of radius of about 4 arcmin. A
second contribution comes from a thermal component which contributes flux
primarily at low energies. Despite the absence of any pulsed emission detected
from the compact source, we argue that the emission is most probably due to a
rotating compact object that is powering the detected synchrotron nebula within
the SNR. \\

of a supernova that exploded near the earth several Myr ago. In this paper, we
consider the possible background sources, and confirm that the measured
$^{60}$Fe is significantly higher than all known backgrounds, in contrast with
the reported abundance of live $^{53}$Mn. We discuss scenarios in which the
data are consistent with a supernova event at a distance $D \sim 30$ pc and an
epoch $t_{\rm SN} \sim 5$ Myr ago. We propose tests that could confirm or
refute the interpretation of the $^{60}$Fe discovery, including searches for
$^{10}$Be, $^{129}$I and $^{146}$Sm. Such a nearby supernova event might have
had some impact on the earth's biosphere, principally by enhancing the
cosmic-ray flux. This might have damaged the earth's ozone layer, enhancing the
penetration of solar ultraviolet radiation. In this connection, we comment on
the Middle Miocene and Pliocene mini-extinction events. We also speculate on
the possibility of a supernova-induced ""cosmic-ray winter,"" if cosmic rays play
a significant role in seeding cloud formation.

by Binggeli et al. (1987) to the intra-cluster gas. We use the Virgo Cluster
Catalog in combination with data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The galaxy
distribution and the gas distribution are relatively similar. In both wavebands
the irregular structure of Virgo can be decomposed into three major subclusters
centred on M87, M49, and M86. A new statistical method of subcluster
decomposition is applied. Radial galaxy and X-ray density profiles of the three
subclusters are fitted with beta-models, allowing analytic deprojection.
Comparison of these profiles reveals, that there is no general luminosity
segregation. The gas density profile is steeper than the galaxy density profile
in the inner part, while this trend is reversed in the outer part. A comparison
among the subclusters shows the poorer the subcluster the steeper its radial
profile, i.e. the more compact it is, both in the optical and the X-rays. The
subcluster profiles for different Hubble types confirm the well-known result
that the distribution of the late-type galaxies is more extended than the early
types. Differential and integrated mass density profiles of the different
components in the M87 and M49 subclusters are presented. The total, gravitating
mass is inferred from the distribution of the X-ray gas. In the M87 subcluster
the gas mass is about three times the mass in galaxies, while it accounts only
for 8% to 14% of the total mass at 0.4 and 1 Mpc, respectively. In the M49
subcluster there is more mass in the galaxies than in the gas and the
gas-to-total mass fraction is only 1%, which is unusually low for a cluster.
The mass-to-light ratios show relatively constant values around 500Msol/Lsol.

the optical--near-infrared colour distribution of a large flux-limited sample
of field spheroidal galaxies identified morphologically from archival Hubble
Space Telescope data. The $I_{814}-HK'$ colour distribution for a sample
jointly limited at $I_{814}<$23 mag and $HK'<$19.5 mag is used to constrain the
star formation history of elliptical and S0 galaxies. We detect a significant
deficit of intrinsically red spheroids. From limited spectroscopic and deeper
photometric redshift data, we demonstrate that this deficit results from a
strong evolutionary effect. The space density of spheroidals of all colours at
faint limits is lower than expected for a population of constant comoving
density. We conclude that field ellipticals cannot have formed all of their
stars at high redshift, as has been suggested for the bulk of their clustered
counterparts. We compare alternative evolutionary histories with our data,
including an analytical representation of recent models based on the
hierarchical assembly of ellipticals, which provides a better, though not ideal
fit. The accumulation of spectroscopic redshifts for our sample will allow a
quantitative discrimination between models with extended star formation.

structure compound LiV_{2}O_{4} were carried out using a heat-pulse calorimeter
over the temperature T range from 1.2 to 108 K. The electronic specific heat
C_{e}(T) of LiV_{2}O_{4} is extracted from the C_{p}(T) data using the lattice
contribution obtained for LiTi_{2}O_{4}, a superconductor with T_{c} = 11.8 K.
The electronic specific heat coefficient \gamma(T) = C_{e}(T)/T of LiV_{2}O_{4}
is found to be 0.42 and 0.43 J/mol K^2 at T = 1 K for two different high
magnetic purity samples, respectively. \gamma(T) decreases rapidly with
increasing temperature from 4 to 30 K and then decreases much more slowly from
0.13 J/mol K^2 at 30 K to 0.08 J/mol K^2 at 108 K. The C_{e}(T) is compared
with theoretical predictions for the spin S = 1/2 Kondo model, a generic Fermi
liquid model, and an antiferromagnetically coupled quantum-disordered metal.
Each of these theories can adequately describe C_{e}(T) in the Fermi liquid
regime at low (~ 1 to 10 K) temperatures, consistently yielding a large
extrapolated \gamma(0) = 428(3) mJ/mol K^2. However, none of these theories
describes C_{e}(T) from ~ 10 K to 108 K. Our C_{e}(T) data are also in severe
disagreement with the magnetic specific heat of the spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg
model. Thermal expansion measurements of LiV_{2}O_{4} were carried out from 4.4
to 297 K using a differential capacitance dilatometer. Strong increases in the
thermal expansion coefficient and Gr\""uneisen parameter \Gamma are found below
\~ 20 K, confirming the results of Chmaissem et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 4866
(1997)] obtained using neutron diffraction. We estimate that \Gamma(0) is about
11.4.

the kernel of the presymplectic form in configuration-velocity space. Local
expressions for a basis of this kernel are obtained using phase space
procedures; the obstructions to the formulation of the dynamics in the reduced
phase space are identified and circumvented. We show that this reduction
procedure is equivalent to the standard Dirac method as long as the Dirac
conjecture holds: that the Dirac Hamiltonian, containing the primary first
class constraints, with their Lagrange multipliers, can be enlarged to an
extended Dirac Hamiltonian which includes all first class constraints without
any change of the dynamics. The quotienting procedure is always equivalent to
the extended Dirac theory, even when it differs from the standard Dirac theory.
The differences occur when there are ineffective constraints, and in these
situations we conclude that the standard Dirac method is preferable --- at
least for classical theories. An example is given to illustrate these features,
as well as the possibility of having phase space formulations with an odd
number of physical degrees of freedom.
