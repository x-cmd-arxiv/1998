3.5 and varies rapidly with temperature. The clumpy distribution of hot diffuse

gas density of the regions of undetected emission within 8' (at most 1/4 and
1/6 of those of the detected gas, assuming both have same temperature,
metallicity and clumpiness). The irregular X-ray morphology of the diffuse

intergalactic gas had sufficiently high specific entropy to be unable to
collapse with the group. Most of the diffuse gas originates from galaxies,
either through tidal stripping or through galactic winds driven by supernova

expect 7 but find 16 - but we do not find that the galaxies are concentrated in
the direction of the CMB decrement. However, we are still not sure of the
distance to the system causing the CMB decrement. We have also used our images
to compare the commonly used object-finding algorithms of FOCAS and SExtractor:
we find FOCAS the more efficient at detecting faint objects and the better at
dealing with composite objects, whereas SExtractor's morphological
classification is more reliable, especially for faint objects near the
resolution limit. More generally, we have also compared the flux lost using
isophotal apertures on a real image with that on a noise-only image: recovery
of artificial galaxies from the noise-only image significantly overestimates
the flux lost from the galaxies, and we find that the corrections made using
this technique suffer a systematic error of some 0.4 magnitudes.

variations of AGN can be used to test the standard black hole-accretion disc
paradigm, by measuring the temperature structure $T(R)$ of the gaseous material
surrounding the purported black hole. Reprocessing of high energy radiation in
a steady-state blackbody accretion disc with $T \propto R^{-3/4}$ incurs a
wavelength-dependent light travel time delay $\tau \propto \lambda ^{4/3}$. The
International AGN Watch multiwavelength monitoring campaign on NGC 7469 showed
optical continuum variations lagging behind those in the UV by about 1 day at
4800\AA and about 2 days at 7500\AA. These UV/optical continuum lags imply a
radial temperature structure $T \propto R^{-3/4}$, consistent with the
classical accretion disc model, and hence strongly supports the existence of a
disc in this system. We assume that the observed time delays are indeed due to
a classical accretion-disc structure, and derive a redshift independent
luminosity distance to NGC 7469. The luminosity distance allows us to estimate
a Hubble constant of $H_{0} (\cos i / 0.7)^{1/2} = 42\pm9 \Hubble$. The
interpretation of the observed time delays and spectral energy distribution in
the context of an accretion disc structure requires further validation. At the
same time, efforts to minimize the systematic uncertainties in our method to
derive a more accurate measurement of $H_{0}$, e.g by obtaining an independent
accurate determination of the disc inclination $i$ or statistical average of a
moderate sample of active galaxies, are required. However, this remains a
promising new method of determining redshift-independent distances to AGNs.

possibility that a massive cluster of galaxies lies in the field, we have
attempted to recover simulated galaxies with intrinsic colours matching those
of the model galaxies used in the photometric redshift estimation. We find that
when such model galaxies are added to our images, there is considerable scatter
of the recovered galaxy redshifts away from the model value; this scatter is
larger than that expected from photometric errors and is the result of
confusion, simply due to ground-based seeing, between objects in the field. We
have also compared the likely efficiency of the photometric redshift technique
against the colour criteria used to select z>3 galaxies via the strong colour
signature of the Lyman-limit break. We find that these techniques may
significantly underestimate the true surface density of z>3, due to confusion
between the high-redshift galaxies and other objects near the line of sight. We
argue that the actual surface density of z=3 galaxies may be as much as 6 times
greater than that estimated by previous ground-based studies, and note that
this conclusion is consistent with the surface density of high-redshift objects
found in the HDF. Finally, we conclude that all ground-based deep field surveys
are inevitably affected by confusion, and note that reducing the effective
seeing in ground-based images will be of paramount importance in observing the

than typical ones, e.g., of sodium, are called semimetals. We suggest a model
for semimetals which takes into account the strong Coulomb repulsion of the
charge carriers, especially important in transition-metal and rare-earth
compounds. For that purpose we extend the Hubbard model by coupling one
additional orbital per site via hybridization to the Hubbard orbitals. We
calculate the spectral function, resistivity and Hall coefficient of the model
using dynamical mean-field theory. Starting from the Mott-insulating state, we
find a transition to a metal with increasing hybridization strength
(``self-doping''). In the metallic regime near the transition line to the
insulator the model shows semimetallic behavior. We compare the calculated
temperature dependence of the resistivity and the Hall coefficient with the one
found experimentally for $\rm Yb_4As_3$. The comparison demonstrates that the
anomalies in the transport properties of $\rm Yb_4As_3$ possibly can be
assigned to Coulomb interaction effects of the charge carriers not captured by
standard band structure calculations.

resolution. The relations between the plate displacement, the dilation of the

begins, the dilation increases exponentially over a slip distance comparable to

frictional force do not depend on the driving velocity, but do depend linearly

dilation rate (rather than the dilation itself), and reaches a maximum value
during the transient acceleration. We find that the layer can temporarily

are included. Various measurable properties, such as magnetic susceptibility
chi(T), electronic specific heat C(T), thermoelectric power S(T), relative
variations in resistivity rho(T), and peak positions in the density-of-states

electronic structure is found to be essential for a good description of most
properties, although the results for S(T) in undoped FeSi can be described up
to about 150 K without considerations of disorder. Above this T, only the
filling of the gap due to disorder accompanied by exchange enhancement, can
explain the large susceptiblity. The overall good agreement with experimental
data for most properties in doped and pure FeSi suggests that this system is
well described by LDA even at large T. Doped FeSi can be described quite well

the TeV scale quantum gravity, in which the ordinary matter is localized on a
3-brane embedded in the space with $N$ extra dimensions, whereas gravity
propagates in the bulk. These operators are scaled by the fundamental Planck
mass $M_{Pf}\sim$ TeV and must be suppressed by the gauge family symmetries. We
study suppression of the most dangerous and model-independent operators.
Several points emerge. First, we show that the Abelian symmetries can not do
the job and one has to invoke non-Abelian $U(2)_F$ (or $U(3)_F$) symmetries.
However, even in this case there emerge severe restrictions on the fermion
mixing pattern and the whole structure of the theory. In order not to be
immediately excluded by the well-known bounds, the horizontal gauge fields {\it
must} be the bulk modes, like gravitons. For the generic hierarchical breaking
pattern the four-fermion operators induced by the tree-level exchange of the
bulk gauge fields are unsuppressed for $N = 2$. For $N > 3$ the suppression
factor goes as a square of the largest $U(2)_F$-non-invariant Yukawa coupling,
which implies the lower bound $M_{Pf} > 10$ TeV or so from the $K^0 - \bar K^0$
system. Situation is different in the scenarios when flavor Higgs fields live
on a ($3 + N'$)-brane of lower dimensionality than the gauge fields. The
further suppression of gauge-mediated operators can be achieved by an explicit
construction: for instance, if $U(2)_F$ is broken by a vacuum expectation value
of the doublet, the troublesome operators are suppressed in the leading order,
due to custodial SO(4) symmetry of the Higgs-gauge quartic coupling.

semigroup to a suitable Schr\""odinger semigroup on the Hilbert space $L^2(R^2)$
of Lebesgue square-integrable functions on the Euclidean plane $R^2$. The
path-integral formula emerges from the standard Feynman-Kac-It\^o formula for
the Schr\""odinger semigroup in the ultra-diffusive limit of the underlying
Brownian bridge on $R^2$. In a similar vein, a path-integral formula can be
constructed for the coherent representation of the unitary time evolution

recently at TIFR by this author and V. Singh. In this theory both position and
momentum for a system point have Hamiltonian evolution in such a way that the
ensemble of system points leads to position and momentum probability densities
agreeing exactly with ordinary quantum mechanics.
