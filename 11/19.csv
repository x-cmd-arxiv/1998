This is especially evident when considering inverse Compton scattering by

rotation of white dwarf stars. Data from global observing campaigns have
revealed a wealth of frequencies, some of which show the signature of
rotational splitting. Tools developed for helioseismology to use many solar
p-mode frequencies for inversion of the rotation rate with depth are adapted to
the case of more limited numbers of modes of low degree. We find that the small
number of available modes in white dwarfs, coupled with the similarity between
the rotational-splitting kernels of the modes, renders direct inversion
unstable. Accordingly, we adopt what we consider to be plausible functional
forms for the differential rotation profile; this is sufficiently restrictive
to enable us to carry out a useful calibration. We show examples of this
technique for PG 1159 stars and pulsating DB white dwarfs. Published frequency
splittings for white dwarfs are currently not accurate enough for meaningful
inversions; reanalysis of existing data can provide splittings of sufficient
accuracy when the frequencies of individual peaks are extracted via
least-squares fitting or multipeak decompositions. We find that when mode
trapping is evident in the period spacing of g modes, the measured splittings
can constrain dOmega/dr.

are +/- 0.4 when only 100 stars are observed, and +/- 0.1 when 1000 stars are

massive stars to form closer to the center of a cloud, at a time somewhat later

for the star formation rate is shown to be appropriate for turbulence
compression, magnetic diffusion, gravitational collapse, and clump or

inability of gas to form stars below the thermal Jeans mass at typical

indicate why the thermal Jeans mass should be nearly constant in normal

interactions in the medium plays an important role in determining the neutrino
mean free paths. The effects due to Pauli-Blocking and density, spin, and
isospin correlations in the medium significantly reduce the neutrino cross
sections. Due to the lack of experimental information at high density, these
correlations are necessarily model dependent. For example, spin correlations in
nonrelativistic models are found to lead to larger suppressions of neutrino
cross sections compared to those of relativistic models. This is due to the
tendency of the nonrelativistic models to develop spin instabilities.
Notwithstanding the above caveats, and the differences between nonrelativistic
and relativistic approaches such as the spin- and isospin-dependent
interactions and the nucleon effective masses, suppressions of order 2--3,
relative to the case in which correlations are ignored, are obtained. Neutrino
interactions in dense matter are especially important for supernova and early
neutron star evolution calculations. The effects of correlations for
protoneutron star evolution are calculated. Large effects on the internal
thermodynamic properties of protoneutron stars, such as the temperature, are
found. These translate into significant early enhancements in the emitted
neutrino energies and fluxes, especially after a few seconds. At late times,
beyond about 10 seconds, the emitted neutrino fluxes decrease more rapidly
compared to simulations without the effects of correlations, due to the more
rapid onset of neutrino transparency in the protoneutron star

nucleon spectra and synchrotron constraints are consistent with gamma-ray
measurements in the 30-500 MeV range, but outside this range excesses are
apparent. A harder nucleon spectrum is considered but fitting to gamma rays
causes it to violate limits from positrons and antiprotons. A harder
interstellar electron spectrum allows the gamma-ray spectrum to be fitted above
1 GeV as well, and this can be further improved when combined with a modified
nucleon spectrum which still respects the limits imposed by antiprotons and
positrons. A large electron/IC halo is proposed which reproduces well the
high-latitude variation of gamma-ray emission. The halo contribution of
Galactic emission to the high-latitude gamma-ray intensity is large, with
implications for the study of the diffuse extragalactic component and
signatures of dark matter. The constraints provided by the radio synchrotron
spectral index do not allow all of the <30 MeV gamma-ray emission to be
explained in terms of a steep electron spectrum unless this takes the form of a
sharp upturn below 200 MeV. This leads us to prefer a source population as the

  accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics","A&A, 343 (1999) 333",,,"astro-ph",,"  Second-order measures, such as the two-point correlation function, are
geometrical quantities describing the clustering properties of a point
distribution. In this article well-known estimators for the correlation
integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the
two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range
of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point
correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson
distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the
approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the
estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We
give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details
of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the
correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS
galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues
in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on
large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several
estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on
scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.

nuclei. The stars move under the combined gravitational influences of the black
hole and the central star cluster. Within the sphere of influence of the black
hole, the orbital periods of the stars are much shorter than the periods of
precession. We average over the orbital motion and end up with a simpler
problem and an extra integral of motion: the product of the black hole mass and
the semimajor axis of the orbit. Thus the black hole enforces some degree of
regularity in its neighborhood. Well within the sphere of influence, (i)
planar, as well as three dimensional, axisymmetric configurations-both of which
could be lopsided-are integrable, (ii) fully three dimensional clusters with no
spatial symmetry whatsover must have semi-regular dynamics with two integrals
of motion. Similar considerations apply to stellar orbits when the black hole
grows adiabatically. We introduce a family of planar, non-axisymmetric
potential perturbations, and study the orbital structure for the harmonic case
in some detail. In the centered potentials there are essentially two main
families of orbits: the familiar loops and lenses, which were discussed in
Sridhar and Touma (1997, MNRAS, 287, L1-L4). We study the effect of
lopsidedness, and identify a family of loop orbits, whose orientation
reinforces the lopsidedness, an encouraging sign for the construction of
self-consistent models of eccentric, discs around black holes, such as in M31

for magnetic loops to inflate and detach from the underlying accretion disc
causes the spectrum of a flare to evolve from soft to hard due to the decrease
of the feedback from the cold disc, so causing time delays between hard and
soft photons. We identify the observed time lags with the evolution timescales
of the flares, which are of the order of the Keplerian timescale. We model the
overall temporal variability using a pulse avalanche model in which each flare
has a certain probability to trigger a neighbouring flare, thus occasionally
producing long avalanches. The duration of the avalanches determines the

(50% of the total radio sample) were obtained with the ESO 3.6-m telescope and
30 redshifts were determined. In addition to a few broad line active galactic
nuclei, three main spectroscopic classes have been found to dominate the faint
radio galaxy population: (1) Early-type galaxies with 0.1 < z < 0.8. (2)
Late-type galaxies at moderate redshift (z < 0.4), with relatively bright
magnitudes (B < 22.5) and sub-mJy radio fluxes. (3) A group of bright
high-redshift (z > 0.8) radio galaxies with moderate-to-strong [OII] emission.
They have spectra, colours and absolute magnitudes similar to those of the
classical bright elliptical radio galaxies found in surveys carried out at
higher radio fluxes. Star-forming galaxies do not constitute the main
population of our radio sources identified with galaxies. In fact, even at
sub-mJy level the majority of our radio sources are identified with early-type
galaxies. This apparent discrepancy with previous results is due to the fainter
magnitude limit reached in our spectroscopic identifications. Moreover, using
mainly the large radio-to-optical ratio and the information from the available
limits on the optical magnitudes of the unidentified radio sources, we conclude
that the great majority of them are likely to be early-type galaxies, at z > 1.
If correct, it would suggest that the evolution of the radio luminosity
function of spiral galaxies, including starbursts, might not be as strong as
suggested in previous evolutionary models.

this Comment is to show the inconsistency of the value of effective magnetic
moment \mu_{eff} reported by Zou et al. (2.92\mu_B) with their magnetic
susceptibility data. The estimation made directly from their data points gives
a considerably smaller value of \mu_{eff}=2.09\mu_B. At the same time the
values of mu_{eff}=2.9\mu_B and 3.1\mu_B were obtained for our Pr123 single
crystals grown by flux method for H||ab-plane and H||c-axis, respectively. This
suggests that Pr occupies only about a half of the RE sites in TSFZ crystal.
The other half of the RE sites is occupied most probably by the nonmagnetic Ba.
Noteworthy, SC with T_c=43 K was observed earlier for
Pr_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-y} thin films. Ba^{2+} has a larger ionic radius
than Pr^{3+} and so the substitution of Ba for Pr could give a natural

been theoretically studied by LeBlanc et al., in the continuation of Clem's
calculations. These situations have been investigated by applying a dc current
to a silver-gold sheathed Bi-2223 tape at 77 K (critical current 29 A), in
addition to the usual ac transport current. The ac losses were measured by the
null calorimetric method to ensure that the total losses were being accounted
for. These were recorded for different values of the ac and dc currents,
leading to the observation of two different behaviors depending on the ac
current. Our revelation of the Clem valley is, to our knowledge, the first

gaps when the following condition is satisfied with some integer $j$,
$g^*\mu_{\rm B}B_{\rm tot} = j \hbar \omega_{\rm c}^*$, where $g^*$ and
$\omega_{\rm c}^*$ are the g-factor and the cyclotron frequency of the $^4$CF,

always finite even if the above condition is satisfied, thus the reason of the
collapse was left as a mystery. In this comment it is shown that part of the
mystery is resolved by considering the electron-hole symmetry properly.

from electron-tunneling spectroscopy on underdoped, overdoped and Ni-doped
Bi2212 single crystals using a break-junction technique is presented. There are
two different types of superconductivity in cuprates: superconductivity due to
pairing of spinons on charged stripes and magnetic superconductivity mediated
by spin-waves. The coherent state of the spinon superconductivity is
established via the magnetic superconductivity. In NCCO, there is only the
spinon superconductivity and the coherent state is established due to the
Josephson coupling between charged stripes. Below Tc, we observe four different
gaps, namely, (i) a SDW gap due to antiferromagnetic correlations; (ii) a
superconducting gap due to spinon pairing; (iii) a d-wave magnetic
superconducting gap, and (iv) a small superconducting gap most likely having
g-wave symmetry. We show that the d-wave superconductivity is mediated by
spin-waves and the magnitude of the superconducting gap due to pairing of
spinons is larger than the magnitude of the d-wave gap, however, the d-wave gap
is more intense. The superconducting gap due to pairing of spinons most likely
has a s-wave symmetry. The maximum magnitudes of the SDW, the spinon and d-wave
gaps are located at (p/2, p/2), (p/2, p/2) and (p, 0) on the Fermi surface,
respectively. The d-g-wave superconductivity mediated by spin-waves can be
considered as a pairing of magnetic polarons. We formulate a theorem for
cuprates by analogy with the Anderson's theorem for classical superconductors.
The presented model of high-Tc superconductivity naturally explains other
experimental data.

present paper is devoted to a further study of metal-insulator transition in

metal-to-insulator transition. The dependence of energy gap on concentration of
doubly occupancy leads to increasing energy gap width with increase of
temperature. Thus narrow-band system can undergo transition from a metallic
state to an insulating state with the increase of temperature. For some values
of intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion $U$ and $w_0$ ($w_0$ is half-bandwidth) we
find the values of temperature when narrow-band material undergoes transition
from a metallic state to an insulating state. We show that at given $U/w_0$
metal-insulator transition in model with non-equivalent Hubbard sub-bands can
occur at smaller temperature than in the Hubbard model. It testifies on the
fact that taking into account of correlated hopping is important for a
consideration of metal-insulator transition problem.

the effectiveness of the Hund coupling in realizing ferromagnetism in the

studied and thereby dimensional dependence was discussed. In quarter-filled
systems the insulating ferromagnetic state accompanied by alternating orbital
order was found stable. In more-than-quarter filling cases metallic
ferromagnetism is stabilized by the ``double exchange mechanism''. These
results are common to one and infinite dimensions. In less-than-quarter filling
cases the ferromagnetic ground state is stable in one dimension but not in
infinite dimensions. Secondly we examined the electronic states and the
resistivity in the double exchange model by using the one-particle Green
function. The splitting and narrowing of the one-particle spectrum due to the
Hund coupling were clarified in the framework of a single-site approximation.
The resistivity due to the scattering by random localized spins was shown to be
too small to explain the experimental results of doped manganites.

the standard model predictions for the gauge boson self-couplings since the
present value of $R_b$ agrees fairly well with the theoretical estimates.
Moreover, these indirect constraints on $\Delta g^Z_1$ and $g^Z_5$ are more
stringent than the present direct bounds on these quantities, while the

positive integers). We show that every rational number has Egyptian fraction
representations where the number of terms is of the same order of magnitude as
the largest denominator, improving a result from an earlier paper to
best-possible form. We also settle, in best-possible form, the related problem
of how small M_t(r) can be such that there is an Egyptian fraction
representation of r with exactly t terms, the denominators of which are all at
most M_t(r). We also consider the following problems posed by Erdos and Graham:
the set of integers that cannot be the largest denominator of an Egyptian
fraction representation of 1 is infinite - what is its order of growth? How
about those integers that cannot be the second-largest (third-largest, etc.)
denominator of such a representation? In the latter case, we show that only
finitely many integers cannot be the second-largest (third-largest, etc.)
denominator of such a representation; while in the former case, we show that
the set of integers that cannot be the largest denominator of such a
representation has density zero, and establish its order of growth. Both
results extend to representations of any positive rational number.

around the kaon condensate on the basis of chiral symmetry; separating the
zero-mode from the beginning and using the path-integral method, we can
formulate the inclusion of fluctuations in a transparent way. Nucleons as well
as kaons are treated in a self-consistent way to the one-loop order. The
effects of the Goldstone mode, stemming from the breakdown of V- spin symmetry
in the condensed phase, are figured out. A procedure is discussed to
renormalize the divergent integrals properly up to the one-loop order.
Consequently the thermodynamic potential is derived. It is pointed out that the
zero-point fluctuation by nucleons gives a sizable effect, different from the
kaonic one.

favorable states, which are far away from the current equilibrium state? Based
on continuum mechanical considerations we derive a Boussinesq-type equation
which models the dynamics of martensitic phase transformations. The solutions
of the system, which we refer to as microkinetically regularized wave equation
exhibit strong oscillations after short times, thermalization can be confirmed.
That means that macroscopic fluctuations of the solutions decay at the benefit
of microscopic fluctuations. First analytical and numerical results on the
propagation of phase boundaries and thermalization effects are presented.
Despite the fact that model is conservative, it exhibits the hysteretic
behavior. Such a behavior is usually interpreted in macroscopic models in terms
of dissipative threshold which the driving force has to overcome to ensure that
the phase transformation proceeds. The threshold value depends on the amount of
the transformed phase as it is observed in known experiments. Secondly we
investigate the dynamics of oscillatory solutions. We present a formalism based
on Young measures, which allows us to describe the effective dynamics of
rapidly fluctuating solutions. The new method enables us to derive a numerical
scheme for oscillatory solutions based on particle methods.

exhibits robust statistical properties summarized by three notions: (1) the
notion of a typical shape (that among all sequences of fixed length certain
shapes are realized much more frequently than others), (2) the notion of shape
space covering (that all typical shapes are realized in a small neighborhood of
any random sequence), and (3) the notion of a neutral network (that sequences
folding into the same typical shape form networks that percolate through
sequence space). Neutral networks loosen the requirements on the mutation rate
for selection to remain effective. The original (genotypic) error threshold has
to be reformulated in terms of a phenotypic error threshold. With regard to
adaptation, neutrality has two seemingly contradictory effects: It acts as a
buffer against mutations ensuring that a phenotype is preserved. Yet it is
deeply enabling, because it permits evolutionary change to occur by allowing
the sequence context to vary silently until a single point mutation can become
phenotypically consequential. Neutrality also influences predictability of
adaptive trajectories in seemingly contradictory ways. On the one hand it
increases the uncertainty of their genotypic trace. At the same time neutrality
structures the access from one shape to another, thereby inducing a topology
among RNA shapes which permits a distinction between continuous and
discontinuous shape transformations. To the extent that adaptive trajectories
must undergo such transformations, their phenotypic trace becomes more
predictable.

gas is examined and nonlinear operator equations for the motion of the center
of mass of the atoms are derived. The goal is to present a self-consistent set
of coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations for atomic and electromagnetic fields
generalized to include the atomic center-of-mass motion. Two effects are
considered: The ultracold gas forms a medium for the Maxwell field which
modifies its propagation properties. Combined herewith is the influence of the
dipole-dipole interaction between atoms which leads to a density dependent
shift of the atomic transition frequency. It is expressed in a position
dependent detuning and is the reason for the nonlinearity. This results in a
direct and physically transparent way from the quantum field theoretical
version of the local-field approach to electrodynamics in quantum media. The
equations for the matter fields are general. Previously published nonlinear
equations are obtained as limiting cases. As an atom optical application the
scattering of a dense beam of a Bose gas is studied in the Raman-Nath regime.
The main conclusion is that for increasing density of the gas the dipole-dipole
interaction suppresses or enhances the scattering depending on the sign of the
detuning.

based on the uncertainty relation with his interpretation, was the origin of
the Copenhagen interpretation and is still widely adopted, but is shown to be
not consistent with the quantum mechanical view. We point out that in most of
these gedanken experiments, entanglement plays a crucial role, while its
buildup does not change the uncertainty of the concerned quantity in the way
thought by Bohr. Especially, in the gamma ray microscope and recoiling
double-slit gedanken experiments, we expose the entanglement based on momentum
exchange. It is shown that even in such cases, the loss of interference is only
due to the entanglement with other degrees of freedom, while the uncertainty
relation argument, which has not been questioned up to now, is not right.
