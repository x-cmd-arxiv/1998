measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that, given our
present understanding of the foregrounds, they are unlikely to qualitatively
affect the ability of the MAP and Planck satellites to determine the angular
power spectrum of the CMB, the key statistic for constraining cosmological
parameters. Sufficiently far from the galactic plane, the only foregrounds that
will affect power spectrum determination with any significance are the
extragalactic ones. For MAP we find the most troublesome foregrounds are radio
point sources and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. For Planck they
are these same radio point sources and the Far Infrared Background. Prior
knowledge of the statistics of the SZ component (either via theoretical
calculation, or higher frequency observations of just a few percent of the sky,
such as will be done by balloon-borne experiments) may significantly improve
MAP's determination of the CMB power spectrum. We also explore the foreground
impact on MAP and Planck polarization power spectrum measurements.

two possible equilibrium configurations of the system. In for example the
transistion from spin-down to spin-up states the Alfven radius $R_A$ decreases
from a value larger than the corotation radius to one which is smaller. In this

destroy clusters in single collisions; their effect is primarily cumulative,
leading to a relation between $\mbh$ and $\fhalo$, the fraction of the halo in
black holes of mass $\mbh$, which is $\fhalo\mbh < $ constant (up to
logarithmic corrections). For $\fhalo=1$, we find $\mbh \simless 10^{3} \msun$

neglected cluster evolution, mass loss, and stochasticity of energy inputs in

penetrate a cluster without disrupting it; their effect is mainly catastrophic
(close collisions), but also partly cumulative (distant collisions). In the
large $\mbh$ limit, $\fhalo$ (but not $\mbh$) can be constrained by computing
the probability that a cluster survives a combination of close, destructive

nuclear medium. These are the most important sources of neutrino opacity
governing the cooling of a proto-neutron star in the first tens of seconds
after its formation. Because the weak interaction is parity violating, the
absorption and scattering cross-sections depend asymmetrically on the
directions of the neutrino momenta with respect to the magnetic field. We
develop the moment formalism of neutrino transport in the presence of such
asymmetric opacities and derive explicit expressions for the neutrino flux and
other angular moments of the Boltzmann transport equation. For a given neutrino
species, there is a drift flux of neutrinos along the magnetic field in
addition to the usual diffusive flux. This drift flux depends on the deviation
of the neutrino distribution function from thermal equilibrium. Hence, despite
the fact that the neutrino cross-sections are asymmetric throughout the star,
asymmetric neutrino flux can be generated only in the outer region of the
proto-neutron star where the neutrino distribution deviates significantly from
thermal equilibrium. In addition to the asymmetric absorption opacity arising
from nucleon polarization, we find the contribution of the electron (or
positron) ground state Landau level. For neutrinos of energy less than a few
times the temperature, this is the dominant source of asymmetric opacity.
Lastly, we discuss the implication of our result to the origin of pulsar kicks:
in order to generate kick velocity of a few hundred km/s from asymmetric
neutrino emission using the parity violation effect, the proto-neutron star
must have a dipole magnetic field of at least $10^{15}-10^{16}$ G.

97% of the light at 4500 Angstroms and virtually all of the light blueward of

depends on the assumed mass of the thin residual hydrogen envelope: 0.40 < M_WD
< 0.45 solar masses for hydrogen envelope masses of 0 < M_H < 4.0E-4 solar
masses. We argue that the mass of the white dwarf is closer to 0.45 solar

hydrogen envelope. The mass of the M-star is then M_M = 0.28 +/- 0.05 solar
masses, and the inclination is i = 77 +/- 7 degrees. We discuss briefly how PG

the evidence for associating these excess globulars with the galaxy cluster

explained by tidal stripping, at an early epoch, of neighboring galaxies and
subsequent accumulation of globulars in the gravitational potential of the

Region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3. In the region cospatial with the
radio-jet the velocity field is highly perturbed and shows two velocity systems
separated by as much as 1700 km/s. We interpret this to be the consequence of
the rapid expansion of a cocoon of hot gas, shocked and heated by the
radio-emitting outflow, which compresses and accelerates the ambient gas. The
NLR itself is essentially a cylindrical shell expanding supersonically. From
the size and velocity of the expanding region, we derive an upper limit to the
radio-source age, ~< 1.5 E5 years, and a lower limit for the jet power, ~> 2
E42 erg/s required to inflate the cocoon and estimate that the jet minimum
advance speed is 3 E-3 pc per year. The total kinetic energy of the high
velocity NLR gas can be estimated as ~6 E54 erg, comparable to the total energy
carried by the jet over its lifetime and this quantitatively supports the idea
that the NLR gas is accelerated by the jet. If the advance speed of Mrk 3 is
representative of the Seyfert population then these sources must also be short
lived and probably recurrent. The jet kinetic luminosity of Mrk 3 is between 2
and 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for radio-loud AGNs with
similar emission-line luminosity. On the other hand, the fraction of jet power
dissipated in radio-emission is similar. We speculate that the main distinction
between radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN is ascribed to a difference in jet power
rather than to a different efficiency in synchrotron emission production.

spin-Peierls (SP) ordering (T<Tsp) coexists with the antiferromagnetic (AF)
phase (T<TN<Tsp). Tsp decreases while TN increases with increasing x in low
doping region. For higher x, however, the SP state disappears and only the AF
state remains. These features are common for all the doped CuGeO3 systems so
far studied, indicating the existence of universal T-x phase diagram. Recently,
Masuda et al. carried out comprehensive magnetic susceptibility (chi)
measurements of (Cu1-xMgx)GeO3, in which doping concentration can be controlled
significantly better than the Zn doped systems. They found that TN suddenly
jumps from 3.43 to 3.98K at the critical concentration xc sim 0.023 and that a
drop in chi corresponding to the SP ordering also disappears at x>xc. They thus
concluded that there is a compositional phase boundary between two distinct
magnetic phases. To clarify the nature of two phases, we performed
neutron-scattering measurements on (Cu1-xMgx)GeO3 single crystals with various
x. Analysis of the data at fixed temperature points as a function of doping
concentration has revealed sudden changes of order parameters at the critical
concentration xc=0.027 +- 0.001. At finite temperatures below TN, the drastic
increase of the AF moment takes place at xc. The spin-Peierls order parameter
delta associated with lattice dimerization shows a precipitous decrease at all
temperature below Tsp. However, it goes to zero above xc only at the low
temperature limit.

only one single-contact resistance is involved in a typical experimental setup,
in contrast with the purely normal case, where two of them intervene. We
introduce an alternative NS conductance that diverges in the transmissive limit

their $T_C$ and triggers the appearence of a spin glass phase. In this context,
we have solved exactly the problem of N non magnetic impurities in the
staggered flux phase of the Heisenberg model which we assume to be a good
mean-field approximation for the spin-gap phase of the cuprates. In this model,
the quasiparticule spectrum has four nodes on the Fermi surface, and
linearization of the spectrum in the neighbourhood of these nodes leads to a
system of 2D Dirac fermions. In the presence of a macroscopic number of (non
magnetic) impurities, the problem has a characteristic logarithmic structure
that renders ineffective the usual perturbative expansions. We have used this
logarithmic structure to calculate an exact solution. For a concentration ni of
impurities in the unitary scattering limit, the additional density of states is
found to be proportional to $ni/(w \ln^2 (|w|/D))$ (where D is the infrared
cut-off of the linearized spectrum) in analogy with the 1D case of doped
spin-Peierls and two-leg ladders compounds. We argue that the system exhibits a
quasi long-range order at T=0 with instantaneous spin-spin correlations
decreasing as $ni/ \ln^4 (ni/R_{ij})$ for large distances $R_{ij}$ between
impurity sites. We predict enhanced low energy fluctuations and compare these
results to NMR and inelastic neutron scattering experiments in the high-$T_C$

this study is moderately large and the non-hermitian multiboson method is a
superior simulation algorithm. Finite size scaling is studied on lattices of
size $8^3\times 4$, $12^3\times 4$ and $16^3\times 4$. The behaviours of the
peak of the Polyakov loop susceptibility, the deconfinement ratio and the
distribution of the norm of the Polyakov loop are all characteristic of a
first-order phase transition for heavy quarks. As the quark mass decreases, the
first-order transition gets weaker and turns into a crossover. To investigate
finite size scaling on larger spatial lattices we use an effective action in
the same universality class as QCD. This effective action is constructed by
replacing the fermionic determinant with the Polyakov loop identified as the
most relevant Z(3) symmetry breaking term. Higher-order effects are
incorporated in an effective Z(3)-breaking field, $h$, which couples to the
Polyakov loop. Finite size scaling determines the value of $h$ where the first
order transition ends. Our analysis at the end - point, $h_{ep}$, indicates
that the effective model and thus QCD is consistent with the universality class
of the three dimensional Ising model.
  Matching the field strength at the end point, $h_{ep}$, to the $\kappa$
values used in the dynamical quark simulations we estimate the end point,
$\kappa_{ep}$, of the first-order phase transition. We find $\kappa_{ep}\sim
0.08 $ which corresponds to a quark mass of about 1.4 GeV .

model are completely duplicated in the mirror sector (except for an asymmetry
in the weak scale); the three mirror neutrinos can mix with the known neutrinos
via some strongly suppressed mechanism such as the gravitational or heavy right

reside on a $(3+1)$-dimensional wall or ``3-brane'' embedded in a

the fundamental Planck mass $\mst$ to be as small as the weak scale $\mst\simeq
O(\tev)$ and the observed weakness of gravity at long distances is due the
existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. We show that in this
picture it is natural to expect neutrino masses to occur in the $10^{-1} -
10^{-4}\ev$ range, despite the lack of any fundamental scale higher than
$\mst$. Such suppressed neutrino masses are not the result of a see-saw, but
have intrinsically higher-dimensional explanations. We explore two
possibilities. The first mechanism identifies any massless bulk fermions as
right-handed neutrinos. These give naturally small Dirac masses for the same
reason that gravity is weak at long distances in this framework. The second
mechanism takes advantage of the large {\it infrared} desert: the space in the
extra dimensions. Here, small Majorana neutrino masses are generated by
breaking lepton number on distant branes.

ones. It is argued that none of the existing NLO analyses of
$F_2^{\gamma}(x,Q^2)$ takes this difference properly into account. The source
of the ensuing incompleteness is traced back to the misinterpretation of the
behaviour of $q^{\gamma}(x,M)$ as a function of $\alpha_s(M)$. Parton model
interpretation of the so called ``constant terms'' in the LO photonic
coefficient function $C_{\gamma}^{(0)}(x)$ is given and smooth transition
between the properties of virtual and real photon analyzed. Finally
phenomenological consequences of this analysis are discussed.

including anharmonicities in analogy with previous microscopic calculations. We
study the effects of different approximations present in these calculations,
among which the truncation of the hamiltonian and of the space, in connection
with the study of the properties of two-phonon and three-phonon states. By
comparing the approximate results on the spectrum with the exact ones we
conclude that the approximations made in the microscopic calculations on
two-phonon states are well justified. We find also that a good agreement with
the exact results for the three-phonon state is obtained by using a bosonic
hamiltonian truncated at the fourth order. This result makes us confident that
such approximation can be used in realistic calculations, thus allowing a
theoretical study of triple excitations of giant resonances.

physicist interested in measuring a physical quantity, and I try to show that
the reference priors often recommended for the purpose (Jeffreys priors) do not
fit to the problem. Although it may seem surprising, it is easier for an
``experienced physicist'' to accept subjective priors, or even purely
subjective elicitation of probabilities, without explicit use of the Bayes'
theorem. The problem of the use of reference priors is set in the more general
context of ``Bayesian dogmatism'', which could really harm Bayesianism.

to the Bayesian approach than to the frequentist ideas taught at University and
which are considered the reference framework for handling statistical problems.
The combination of intuition and conventional statistics allows practitioners
to get results which are very close, both in meaning and in numerical value, to
those obtainable by Bayesian methods, at least in simple routine applications.
There are, however, cases in which ``arbitrary'' probability inversions produce
unacceptable or misleading results and in these cases the conscious application
of Bayesian reasoning becomes crucial. Starting from these considerations, I
will finally comment on the often debated question: ``is there any chance that
all physicists will become Bayesian?''

theory and general relativity is the experimental inaccessibility of the
unification scale. In this paper we show how incoherent conformal waves in the
gravitational field, which may be produced by quantum mechanical zero-point
fluctuations, interact with the wavepackets of massive particles. The result of
this interaction is to produce decoherence within the wavepackets which could
be accessible in experiments at the atomic scale.
  Using a simple model for the coherence properties of the gravitational field
we derive an equation for the evolution of the density matrix of such a
wavepacket. Following the primary state diffusion programme, the most promising
source of spacetime fluctuations for detection are the above zero-point energy
fluctuations. According to our model, the absence of intrinsic irremoveable
decoherence in matter interferometry experiments puts bounds on some of the
parameters of quantum gravity theories. Current experiments give \lambda > 18.
, where \lambda t_{Planck} is an effective cut-off for the validity of
low-energy quantum gravity theories.

The precise correlation of the subsystems is completely described by the state.
However, it is an experimental choice to study only one subsystem and to ignore
the other. What can we learn about the measured subsystem and the remaining
parts? Results of this kind of measurements look peculiar. The experiment
confirms that the two subsystems are both in mixed states with entropy greater
than zero. One can only obtain statistical knowledge of the subsystems in this
kind of measurement.

of the quantum state of the signal mode within the concept of two-port

an $s$-ordered operator product, where the value of $s$ is entirely determined
by the absolute value of the beam splitter reflectance (or transmittance). The
formalism generalizes previously obtained results that can be recovered by
simple specification of the non-unitary transformation operator. As an
application, we consider the generation of Schr\""odinger-cat-like states. An
extension to mixed states and imperfect detection is outlined.
