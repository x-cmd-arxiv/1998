isolate aspect errors that are repeated through each cycle of the wobble. The
method assigns a 'wobble phase' to each event based on the 402 second period of
the ROSAT wobble. The observation is grouped into a number of phase bins and a
centroid is calculated for each sub-image. The corrected HRI event list is
reconstructed by adding the sub-images which have been shifted to a common

region is well and uniformly populated from the oldest turnoffs up to the 1 Gyr

(1) More massive (luminous) ellipticals formed by galaxy mergers between more
massive spirals have larger metallicity (Z) and thus show redder colors: The
typical metallicity ranges from ~ 1.0 solar abundance (Z~ 0.02) for ellipticals
formed by mergers with M_d = 10^10 M_solar to ~ 2.0 solar (Z ~ 0.04) for those

gradients developed in galaxy mergers is more likely to be larger for massive
ellipticals.
  Absolute magnitude of metallicity gradient correlates with that of age
gradient in ellipticals in the sense that an elliptical with steeper negative
metallicity gradient is more likely to show steeper age gradient. (3) Both
M/L_B and M/L_K, where M, L_B, and L_K are total stellar mass of galaxy

the SED can be fitted with a grey-body spectrum, modified by an extinction law
similar to that observed toward the Galactic Center, with an optical depth of
A_V~19-21 mag. Such a large optical depth implies that a large fraction (as

by dust with a mass between 3x10^3 M_sun and 5x10^5 M_sun. Silicate grains are

select several dark matter halos that have quiet merger histories and are about
to enter the newly forming cluster environment. The halos are replaced with
equilibrium high resolution model spirals that are constructed to represent
examples of low surface brightness (LSB) and high surface brightness (HSB)
galaxies. Varying the disk and halo structural parameters reveals that the
response of a spiral galaxy to tidal encounters depends primarily on the
potential depth of the mass distribution and the disk scale length. LSB
galaxies, characterised by slowly rising rotation curves and large scale
lengths, evolve dramatically under the influence of rapid encounters with
substructure and strong tidal shocks from the global cluster potential ---
galaxy harassment. We find that up to 90% of their stars are tidally stripped
and congregate in large diffuse tails that trace the orbital path of the galaxy
and form the diffuse intra-cluster light. The bound stellar remnants closely
resemble the dwarf spheroidals (dE's) that populate nearby clusters. HSB
galaxies are stable to the chaos of cluster formation and tidal encounters.
These disks lie well within the tidally limited dark matter halos and their
potentials are more concentrated. Although very few stars are stripped, the
scale height of the disks increases substantially and no spiral features
remain, therefore we speculate that these galaxies would be identified as S0
galaxies in present day clusters.

pulse-driven convective zone, which forms in the intershell during the He-shell
flash, leads to more efficient third dredge-up. Some overshoot at the bottom of
the convective envelope removes the He-H discontinuity, which would otherwise
prohibit the occurrence of the third dredge-up for this stellar mass. However,
no correlation between the amount of envelope overshoot and the efficiency of
the third dredge-up has been found. Increasingly efficient third dredge-up
eventually leads to a carbon star model. Due to the partial mixing efficiency

external galaxies a coherent understanding in terms of the chemical evolution-

that need to be addressed are: 1) for some of the larger galaxies only a small
fraction in area has been surveyed so far, 2) surveys have been conducted using
different techniques, and may be incomplete in bolometric magnitude, 3) only
for some galaxies is there information about the late M-star population, 4) not

  From the existing observations one can derive the following: the formation of
carbon stars is both a function of metallicity and star-formation. In galaxies
with a similar star-formation rate history, there will be relatively more
carbon stars formed in the system with the lower metallicity. On the other
hand, the scarcity of AGB type carbon stars in some systems with the lowest
metallicity indicates that these galaxies have had a low, if any,

halos in ellipticals. Studies of globular clusters and planetary nebulae are
now finding outer-halo rotation in many ellipticals, with V/sigma ~ 1 beyond a
few R_e. In some giant ellipticals (M49, M87), there are possible kinematic
differences between metal-poor and metal-rich globular clusters. These results
are consistent with a merger origin for ellipticals. High-quality data and new
modelling techniques now make it possible to determine simultaneously the
orbital anisotropy and gravitational potential in ellipticals from
integrated-light measurements; such studies now provide the best evidence for
dark matter halos in ellipticals.The new generation of 8-10m telescopes, with
multi-object and integral-field spectrographs, will dramatically increase
sample sizes of discrete tracers and provide two-dimensional spectroscopy of
elliptical halos. New methods of analysis will allow robust determinations of

different when the energy density is above the top of the tree level potential
V_0 than when it is below it.When the energy density is below V_0, we find that
non-perturbative particle production through spinodal instabilities provides a
dynamical mechanism for the Maxwell construction. The asymptotic values of the
order parameter only depend on the initial energy density and all values
between the minima of the tree level potential are available, the asymptotic
dynamical `effective potential' is flat between the minima. When the energy
density is larger than V_0, the evolution samples ergodically the broken
symmetry states, as a consequence of non-perturbative particle production via
parametric amplification. Furthermore, we examine the quantum dynamics of phase
ordering into the broken symmetry phase and find novel scaling behavior of the
correlation function. There is a crossover in the dynamical correlation length
at a time scale t_s \sim \ln(1/lambda). For t < t_s the dynamical correlation
length \xi(t) \propto \sqrt{t} and the evolution is dominated by spinodal
instabilities, whereas for t>t_s the evolution is non-linear and dominated by
the onset of non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of long-wavelength
Goldstone bosons.In this regime a true scaling solution emerges with a non-
perturbative anomalous scaling length dimension z=1/2 and a dynamical
correlation length \xi(t) \propto (t-t_s). The equal time correlation function
in this scaling regime vanishes for r>2(t-t_s) by causality. For t > t_s the
equal time correlation function falls of as 1/r. A semiclassical but stochastic
description emerges for time scales t > t_s.

manifestations of the torsion field at low energies. First, the quantum field
theory in an external gravitational field with torsion is reviewed. The
renormalizability requires the nonminimal interaction of torsion with spinor

torsion-dependent terms which have a different structure as compared with the
standard electromagnetic ones. The same concerns the nonrelativistic equations
for spin-${1}/{2}$ particle in an external torsion and electromagnetic fields.
Second, we discuss the propagating torsion. For the Dirac spinor coupled to the
electromagnetic and torsion field there is some additional softly broken local
symmetry associated with torsion. As a consequence of this symmetry, in the
framework of effective field theory, the torsion action is fixed with accuracy
to the values of the coupling constant of the torsion-spinor interaction, mass
of the torsion and higher derivative terms. The introduction of the Higgs field
spoils the consistency of this scheme, and the effective quantum field theory
for torsion embedded into the Standard Model is not possible. The
phenomenological consequences of the torsion-fermion interaction are drown and

give theories on 4-manifold thickenings of 2-complexes; the usual 3-manifold

(Bennett 1995, Preskill 1998). One of the most unexpected is a procedure called
quantum teleportation (Bennett et al 1993) that allows the quantum state of a
system to be transported from one location to another, without moving through
the intervening space. Partial implementations of teleportation (Bouwmeester et
al 1997, Boschi et al 1998) over macroscopic distances have been achieved using
optical systems, but omit the final stage of the teleportation procedure. Here
we report an experimental implementation of the full quantum teleportation
operation over inter-atomic distances using liquid state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). The inclusion of the final stage enables for the first time a
teleportation implementation which may be used as a subroutine in larger
quantum computations, or for quantum communication. Our experiment also
demonstrates the use of quantum process tomography, a procedure to completely
characterize the dynamics of a quantum system. Finally, we demonstrate a

quantum information processing by trapped particles. As an illustration the
effect of quantum statistics at a 50-50 beam splitter is investigated. For
non-interacting particles we regain the results known from photon experiments,
but we have found that particle interactions destroy the perfect bosonic
correlations. Fermions avoid each other due to the exclusion principle and
hence they are far less sensitive to particle interactions. For bosons, the
behavior can be explained with simple analytic considerations which predict a
certain amount of universality. This is verified by detailed numerical
calculations.

  Phys. vol 41, pp 370-384 (2000)",,"10.1063/1.533137","SUITP 98-21","solv-int nlin.SI",,"  Cubic invariants for two-dimensional Hamiltonian systems are investigated
using the Jacobi geometrization procedure. This approach allows for a unified
treatment of invariants at both fixed and arbitrary energy. In the geometric
picture the invariant generally corresponds to a third rank Killing tensor,
whose existence at a fixed energy value forces the metric to satisfy a
nonlinear integrability condition expressed in terms of a Kahler potential.
Further conditions, leading to a system of equations which is overdetermined
except for singular cases, are added when the energy is arbitrary. As solutions
to these equations we obtain several new superintegrable cases in addition to
the previously known cases. We also discover a superintegrable case where the
cubic invariant is of a new type which can be represented by an energy
dependent linear invariant. A complete list of all known systems which admit a
cubic invariant at arbitrary energy is given.
