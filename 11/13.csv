(ENACS) to separate early- and late-type galaxies in the ENACS clusters, by
applying a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in combination with an Artificial
Neural Network (ANN). We represented the spectra by 15 Principal Components,
which form the input for the ANN. The latter was trained with morphological
types from Dressler, and its success rate was estimated from an independent
testing set of galaxies. The success-rate for an early- (E+S0) vs. late-type
(Sp+Irr) classification is close to 75 %; somewhat higher for the early-type
galaxies, and somewhat lower for the late-type galaxies. Using the results of
the PCA/ANN analysis ('spectral' galaxy types for 3798 galaxies, 57 % of which
are of early type and 43 % of late type) we constructed a composite cluster of
2594 galaxies. The late-type galaxies appear to have a larger line-of-sight
velocity dispersion and are less centrally concentrated than the early-type
galaxies. The late-type galaxies with emission lines (OII, H-beta, OIII) in
their spectra are mostly responsible for this difference. The properties of the
late-type galaxies without emission lines are more like those of the early-type
galaxies than like those of the late-type galaxies with emission lines. The
interpretation of the large velocity dispersion and the extended distribution,
in terms of fairly radial (possibly 'first-approach') orbits is probably linked
primarily to the presence of emission-line gas and much less to galaxy type.

analysis and comparison to deep optical and radio data have allowed us to
generate a catalog of 78 15um sources with both radio and optical
identifications. They are redder and lie at higher redshift than I-band
selected galaxies, with most of them being star-forming galaxies. We have
considered the galaxies detected at radio and 15$\mu$m wavelengths which
potentially include all strong and heavily extincted starbursts, up to z=1.
Spectral energy distributions (SED) for each of the sources have been derived
using deep radio, mid-IR, near-IR, optical and UV photometry. The sources were
then spectrally classified by comparing to SEDs of well known nearby galaxies.
By deriving their FIR luminosities by interpolation, we can estimate their Star
Formation Rate (SFR) in a way which does not depend sensitively on the
extinction. 75% (-40%, +10%) of the star formation at $z \le 1$ is related to
IR emission and the global extinction is in the range Av=0.5 -- 0.85. While
heavily extincted starbursts, with SFR in excess of 100 Mo/yr constitute less
than a percent of all galaxies, they contribute about 18% of the SFR density
out to z=1. Their morphologies range from S0 to Sab, and more than a third are
interacting systems. The SFR derived by FIR fluxes is likely to be ~2.9 times
higher than those previously estimated from UV fluxes. The derived stellar mass
formed since the redshift of 1 could be too high when compared to the present
day stellar mass density. This might be due to an IMF in distant star-forming
galaxies different from the solar neighborhood one, or to an underestimate of
the local stellar mass density.

azimuthally-averaged dispersion profile joins smoothly at large radii with the
dispersions of planetary nebulae. Unexpectedly, we find sharp bends in the

sharp kinematic features: an abrupt flattening of the dispersion profile, and
local peaks in h_3 and h_4. All of these features are in a region where the
surface brightness profile departs significantly from a de Vaucouleurs law.

have ensued due to the final He-shell flash which occurred during the descent
along the white dwarf cooling track. The observed changes in the H and Li
abundances can be explained by ingestion and burning of the H-rich envelope and
Li-production through the Cameron-Fowler mechanism. The rapidly increasing
abundances of the light s-elements (including Sc) is consistent with current
s-processing by neutrons released from the concomitantly produced 13C. However,
the possibility that the s-elements have previously been synthesized during the
AGB-phase and only mixed to the surface in connection with the final He-shell
flash cannot be convincingly ruled out either. Since Sakurai's object shows
substantial abundance similarities with the R CrB stars and has recently

between the different environments appears to occur smoothly from Ae to Be

  Only the most massive stars (10-20Msun) are found to be associated with dense
(10^3 pc^-3) stellar clusters. This is exactly the mass regime at which the
conventional accretion scenario for isolated star formation faces theoretical
problems. Thus our findings strongly supports the idea that the formation of

convergence radius $(R_{conv})$ is found to be $\sim 300-400$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc for
the EMSS sample and $\sim 450-500$ h$^{-1}$ Mpc for the ROSAT detected quasars
sample, which suggests that X-ray AGNs have a much deeper contribution to the
Local Group (LG) motion compared to the galaxy and cluster samples. Using the
properties of the angular and spatial correlation functions for these samples,
we find: $b_{IRAS}/b_{quasars} = 3.61 \pm 2.7$; $b_{IRAS}/b_{EMSS}= 8.46 \pm
6.4$ and $b_{quasars} / b_{EMSS} = 2.35 \pm 0.2$. Using Chi-squared
minimisation, we have fitted the angular correlation functions using the
standard power law model of the form: $W(\theta)= A \theta^{-\delta}$, and the
spatial correlation functions using the power law model of the form: $\xi(r)
=(r/r_{0})^{-\gamma}$. For the angular correlation functions, we find $A
\sim0.6$ for the AGN auto-correlations and $A \sim0.2-0.3$ for the AGN-IRAS
galaxy cross-correlations. Also $\delta$ is found to be $~ 0.8-1.1$. In the
spatial correlation analysis, we find $r_{o}\sim3.5-5.1$ $h^{-1}Mpc$ and
$\gamma\sim1.4-1.7$ .

with surroundings. Based on $\hbar$-scaling of an equation for time evolution
of the Wigner's quasi-probability distribution function in presence of
dissipation and thermal diffusion we derive a semiclassical equation for
quantum fluctuations. This identifies an early regime of evolution dominated by
fluctuations in the curvature of the potential due to classical chaos and
dissipation. A stochastic treatment of this classical fluctuations leads us to
a Fokker-Planck equation which is reminiscent of Kramers' equation for
thermally activated processes. This reveals an interplay of three aspects of
evolution of quantum noise in weakly dissipative open systems; the reversible
Liouville flow, the irreversible chaotic diffusion which is characteristic of
the system itself, and irreversible dissipation induced by the external
reservoir. It has been demonstrated that in the dissipation-free case a
competition between Liouville flow in the contracting direction of phase space
and chaotic diffusion sets a critical width in the Wigner function for quantum
fluctuations. We also show how the initial quantum noise gets amplified by
classical chaos and ultimately equilibrated under the influence of dissipation.
We establish that there exists a critical limit to the expansion of phase
space. The limit is determined by chaotic diffusion and dissipation. Making use
of appropriate quantum-classical correspondence we verify the semiclassical
analysis by the fully quantum simulation in a chaotic quartic oscillator.

frictionless spherical beads of random sizes, such as a colloidal glass. Such
an assembly is minimally connected: the ratio of constraint equations to
contact forces approaches unity for a large assembly. However, the bead
positions in a finite subregion of the assembly are underdetermined. Thus to
maintain equilibrium, half of the exterior contact forces are determined by the
other half. We argue that the transmission of force may be regarded as
unidirectional, in contrast to the transmission of force in an elastic
material. Specializing to sequentially deposited beads, we show that forces on
a given buried bead can be uniquely specified in terms of forces involving more
recently added beads. We derive equations for the transmission of stress
averaged over scales much larger than a single bead. This derivation requires
the Ansatz that statistical fluctuations of the forces are independent of
fluctuations of the contact geometry. Under this Ansatz, the
$d(d+1)/2$-component stress field can be expressed in terms of a d-component
vector field. The procedure may be generalized to non-sequential packings. In
two dimensions, the stress propagates according to a wave equation, as
postulated in recent work elsewhere. We demonstrate similar wave-like
propagation in higher dimensions, assuming that the packing geometry has
uniaxial symmetry. In macroscopic granular materials we argue that our approach
may be useful even though grains have friction and are not packed

in any attempt to quantify the degree of entanglement in the state of a
multipartite quantum system. These measures can be regarded as generalizations
of the classical Shannon-Wiener information of a probability distribution into
the quantum regime. In the present work we introduce a previously unknown
approach to the Shannon-Wiener information which provides an intuitive
interpretation for its functional form as well as putting all entanglement
measures with a similar structure into a new context: By formalizing the
process of information gaining in a set-theoretical language we arrive at a
mathematical structure which we call ''tree structures'' over a given set. On
each tree structure, a tree function can be defined, reflecting the degree of
splitting and branching in the given tree. We show in detail that the
minimization of the tree function on, possibly constrained, sets of tree
structures renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener information. This
finding demonstrates that entropy-like information measures may themselves be
understood as the result of a minimization process on a more general underlying
mathematical structure, thus providing an entirely new interpretational
framework to entropy-like measures of information and entanglement. We suggest
three natural axioms for defining tree structures, which turn out to be related
to the axioms describing neighbourhood topologies on a topological space. The
same minimization that renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener

$f$-vectors of cubical polytopes. This is largely motivated by the complete
characterization of the $f$-vectors of simplicial polytopes given by Stanley,
Billera, and Lee in 1980. Along these lines Blind and Blind have shown that
unlike in the simplicial case, there are parity restrictions on the $f$-vectors
of cubical polytopes. In particular, except for polygons, all even dimensional
cubical polytopes must have an even number of vertices. Here this result is
extended to a class of zonotopal complexes which includes simply connected odd
dimensional manifolds. This paper then shows that the only modular equations
which hold for the $f$-vectors of all d-dimensional cubical polytopes (and
hence spheres) are modulo two. Finally, the question of which mod two equations
hold for the $f$-vectors of PL cubical spheres is reduced to a question about
the Euler characteristics of multiple point loci from codimension one PL
immersions into the $d$-sphere. Some results about this topological question
are known (Eccles,Herbert,Lannes) and Herbert's result we translate into the
cubical setting, thereby removing the PL requirement. A central definition in
this paper is that of the derivative complex, which captures the correspondence
between cubical spheres and codimension one immersions.

dimension <=0 in C^n, find all solutions in Z^n of f_1=...=f_m=0. (II) For a

reference orbit made of circular arcs and straight lines that join smoothly
with each other. For this choice of the reference orbit, results are given for
the transfer functions, transfer matrices, and the transit times of the magnets
and drift spaces. These results provide a symplectic integrator, and allow the
linear orbit parameters to be computed by multiplying transfer matrices. It is
shown that this integrator is a second-order integrator, and that the transfer
functions can be derived from a hamiltonian.

of the theory of evolution. The idea of adaptive walks in fitness landscapes
has triggered a vast amount of research and has led to many important insights
about the progress of evolution. Nevertheless, the small step to time-dependent
fitness landscapes has most of the time not been taken. In this work, some
elements of a theory of adaptive walks on changing fitness landscapes are
proposed, and are subsequently applied to and tested on a simple family of
time-dependent fitness landscapes, the oscillating NK landscapes, also
introduced here. For these landscapes, the parameter governing the evolutionary
dynamics is the fraction of static fitness contributions f_S. For small f_S,
local optima are virtually non-existent, and the adaptive walk constantly
encounters new genotypes, whereas for large f_S, the evolutionary dynamics
reduces to the one on static fitness landscapes. Evidence is presented that the
transition between the two regimes is a 2nd order phase transition akin a
percolation transition. For f_S close to the critical point, a rich dynamics
can be observed. The adaptive walk gets trapped in noisy limit cycles, and
transitions from one noisy limit cycle to another occur sporadically.

  shifts and time delays in multichannel scattering","26 pages, 7 figures, RevTeX, will be submitted to Phys. Rev. A, Major
  conceptual changes",,,,"physics.atom-ph",,"  Recently, we showed that eigenphase shifts and eigentime delays near a
resonance for a system of one discrete state and two continua are functionals
of the Beutler-Fano formula using appropriate dimensionless energy units and
line profile indices and identified parameters responsible for the avoided
crossing of eigenphase shifts and eigentime delays and also identified
parameters responsible for the eigentime delays due to a change in frame
transformation.
  In this paper, the geometrical realization of the Beutler-Fano formulas is
considered in the three-dimensional Liouville space spanned by the Pauli
matrices, where dynamic operators are vectors. Vectors corresponding to the
background scattering matrix, the S matrix, and the time delay matrix Q form a
spherical triangle whose vertex and edge angles are parameters pertaining to
the frame transformations among eigenchannels of those matrices and eigenphase
shifts of the scattering matrices and the phase shift due to a resonance
scattering. The cotangent laws of the spherical triangle yield Beutler-Fano
resonance formulas appearing in eigenphase shifts and time delays. Duality
holding for the spherical triangle explains the symmetry observed in the
relations among parameters and provides a systematic way of defining conjugate
dynamic parameters. The spherical triangle also shows the rule of combining the
channel-channel couplings in the background scattering with the resonant
interaction to give the avoided crossing interactions in the curves of
eigenphase shifts as functions of eneryg.
  The theory developed in the previous and present papers is applied to the
vibrational predissociation of triatomic van der Waals molecules.

give evidence for a rather high stability of the prismane, the activation

bosons confined in a leaky box, when its number fluctuation is initially (t=0)
suppressed. We take account of quantum fluctuations of all modes, including k =
0. We identify a ``natural coordinate'' b_0 of the interacting bosons, by which
many physical properties can be simply described. Using b_0, we successfully
define the cosine and sine operators for interacting many bosons. The
wavefunction, which we call the ``number state of interacting bosons'' (NSIB),
of the ground state that has a definite number N of interacting bosons can be
represented simply as a number state of b_0. We evaluate the time evolution of
the reduced density operator \rho(t) of the bosons in the box with a finite
leakage flux J, in the early time stage for which Jt << N. It is shown that
\rho(t) evolves from a single NSIB at t = 0, into a classical mixture of NSIBs
of various values of N at t > 0. We define a new state called the
``number-phase squeezed state of interacting bosons'' (NPIB). It is shown that
\rho(t) for t>0 can be rewritten as the phase-randomized mixture (PRM) of
NPIBs. It is also shown that the off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) and the
order parameter defined by it do not distinguish the NSIB and NPIB. On the
other hand, the other order parameter \Psi, defined as the expectation value of
the boson operator, has different values among these states. For each element
of the PRM of NPIBs, we show that \Psi evolves from zero to a finite value very
quickly. Namely, after the leakage of only two or three bosons, each element
acquires a full, stable and definite (non-fluctuating) value of \Psi.

disappear if the physical states are represented by vectors from the extended
Hilbert space on which the scattering theory of Lax and Phillips has been

verified quantum-mechanical predictions remain the same. The extended
mathematical model is also in full agreement with results of EPR experiments,
if one takes into account that a further assumption (in addition to locality
