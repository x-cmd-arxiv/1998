during a strong flare on 1993 December 22 in the very active, young, rapidly
rotating, single K2 dwarf LQ Hya. The initial impulsive phase of the flare,
which started sometime between 2:42 UT and 4:07 UT, was characterized by strong
optical continuum enhancement and blue-shifted emission lines with broad wings.
The optical chromospheric lines reached their maximum intensity at
$\approx$5:31 UT, by which time the blue-shift vanished and the optical
continuum enhancement had sharply decreased. Thereafter, the line emission
slowly decreased and the lines red-shift in a gradual phase that lasted at
least two more hours. The Mg II lines behaved similarly. Quiescent C IV flux
levels were not recovered until 21 hours later, though a data gap and a
possible second flare make the interpretation uncertain. In addition to the
typically flare-enhanced emission lines (e.g., H_alpha and H_beta), we observe
He I D_3 going into emission, plus excess emission (after subtraction of the
quiescent spectrum) in other He I and several strong neutral metal lines (e.g.,
Mg I b). Flare enhancement of the far UV continuum generally agrees with a Si I
recombination model. We estimate the total flare energy, and discuss the broad
components, asymmetries, and Doppler shifts seen in some of the emission lines.

counterparts of large scale radio sources. Correlations found between their
peak frequency, peak flux density and angular size provide strong evidence that
synchrotron self absorption is the cause of the spectral turnovers, and
indicate that young radio sources evolve in a self-similar way. The difference
in redshift distribution between young and old radio sources must be due to a
difference in slope of their luminosity functions, and we argue that this slope
is strongly affected by the luminosity evolution of the individual sources. A
luminosity evolution scenario is proposed in which GPS sources increase in
luminosity and large scale radio sources decrease in luminosity with time. It
is shown that such a scenario agrees with the local luminosity function of GPS
galaxies.

compressible generalization of the Kraichnan ensemble of turbulent velocities.
We show that, depending on the degree of compressibility, the trajectories
either explosively separate or implosively collapse. The two behaviors are
shown to result in drastically different statistical properties of scalar
quantities passively advected by the flow. At weak compressibility, the
explosive separation of trajectories induces a familiar direct cascade of the
energy of a scalar tracer with a short-distance intermittency and dissipative
anomaly. At strong compressibility, the implosive collapse of trajectories
leads to an inverse cascade of the tracer energy with suppressed intermittency
and with the energy evacuated by large scale friction. A scalar density whose
advection preserves mass exhibits in the two regimes opposite cascades of the
total mass squared. We expect that the explosive separation and collapse of
Lagrangian trajectories occur also in more realistic high Reynolds number
velocity ensembles and that the two phenomena play a crucial role in fully
developed turbulence.

After averaging over the random complex tunneling amplitude, the problem is
