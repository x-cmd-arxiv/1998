redshifts out to z=3. We use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to
compute the expected evolution of the galaxy correlation function with
redshift. We illustrate how the degree of clustering evolution is sensitive to
the details of the sample selection. For a fixed apparent magnitude limit,
galaxies selected at higher redshifts are located in progressively rarer dark
matter haloes, compared with the general population of galaxies in place at
each redshift. As a result these galaxies are highly biased tracers of the
underlying dark matter distribution and exhibit stronger clustering than the
dark matter. In general, the correlation length measured in comoving units,
decreases at first with increasing redshift, before increasing again at higher
redshift. We show that the epsilon-model often used to interpret the angular
correlation function of faint galaxies gives an inadequate description of the
evolution of clustering, and offers no physical insight into the clustering
process. We compare our predictions with those of a simple, popular model in
which a one-to-one correspondence between galaxies and dark halos is assumed.
Qualitatively, this model reproduces the correct evolutionary behaviour at high
redshift, but the quantitative results can be significantly in error. Our
theoretical expectations are in good agreement with the high redshift
clustering data of Carlberg etal and Postman etal but are higher than the
measurements of Le Fevre etal.

solution of the coupled linearized Boltzmann-Poisson equations, we find that

In particular, as Weinberg has noted, the halo provides an excellent medium for
transmitting disturbances from the outer regions of galaxies to the inner
regions. The dipolar response typically dominates and, in some cases, is very
weakly damped. The monopole and quadrupole response can also make significant
contributions. Overall, the results support the notion that disk structure can
be excited by transmission of noise from the distant halo. The strong dipolar
response suggests that halos play a role in producing lopsided disks. These
results also suggest that, during formation from initial collapse, halos do not
settle rapidly into static equilibrium: instead, they may continue to ring and

anisotropy, but only slightly on the shape of the potential. We also present
high resolution N-body simulations of the orbital decay of satellite systems on
eccentric orbits in an isothermal halo. The dynamical friction timescales are
found to decrease with increasing orbital eccentricity, but the dependence is
weaker than previously suggested. The orbital eccentricity stays remarkably
constant throughout the decay; although the eccentricity decreases near
pericenter, it increases again near apocenter, such that there is no net
circularization. Finally, we discuss a number of applications. We find that the
distribution of orbital eccentricities of the globular clusters in the Milky

density is dominant and the potential behaves in a specified manner, or if
matter violates the strong energy conditon $\rho + 3p >0$. When the expansion

rapidly for energies below this, low-energy measurements of cosmic antiprotons
