of dense molecular gas clouds - clumpuscules of masses $M_c\sim 10^{-3} \msun$
and radii $R_c\sim 3\times 10^{13}$ cm - are considered. Recent models of the
extreme scattering events - refraction of radio-waves from quasars in dense
plasma clumps in the Galactic halo - definitely show on such clouds as possible
dark matter candidate. We argue that collisions of such clumpuscules are quite
frequent: around $1-10 \msun$ a year can be ejected in the interstellar medium
due to collisions. Optical continuum and 21 cm emissions from post-collisional
gas are found to be observable. We show that clumpuscules can form around O
stars HII regions of sizes $R\sim 30$ pc and emission measure $EM\simeq 20
cm^{-6}$ pc, and can also be observable in $H_\alpha$ emission. Evaporation of
clumpuscules by external ionizing radiation can be a substantial mass source.
  From requirement that the total mass input on the Hubble time cannot exceed
the luminous mass in the Galaxy, typical radius of clouds is constrained as
$R_c < 3.5\times 10^{12}$ cm, and their contribution to surface mass density as
50 $\msun pc^{-2}$. It is argued that dissipation of kinetic energy of the gas
ejected by such clouds can be an efficient energy source for the Galactic halo.

different soft gamma repeater, which displayed a hard energy spectrum at its
peak, and was followed by a ~300 s long tail with a soft energy spectrum and a
dramatic 5.16 s period. Its peak and time integrated energy fluxes at Earth are
the largest yet observed from any cosmic source. This event was probably
initiated by a massive disruption of the neutron star crust, followed by an
outflow of energetic particles rotating with the period of the star. Comparison
of these two bursts supports the idea that magnetic energy plays an important
role, and that such giant flares, while rare, are not unique, and may occur at
any time in the neutron star's activity cycle.

inflation + cold dark matter; it can extend our understanding of the Universe

of this new paradigm: flat Universe and scale-invariant spectrum of Gaussian
density perturbations, and an avalanche of telling cosmological observations is
coming. If inflation + cold dark matter is correct, then there are new,
fundamental questions to be answered, most notably the nature of the dark
energy that seems to account for 60% of the critical density and how inflation
fits into a unified theory of the forces and particles. These are exciting

of 6500 sources observed with the Very Large Array as part of the Cosmic Lens
All Sky Survey (CLASS) during the first two sessions of its observations. A
comparison between the predicted and the observed number of lensed radio
sources allows a determination of the current value of Omega-Lambda. If there
are six strongly lensed sources in this sample, our 95% confidence upper limit
on Lambda in a flat universe is 0.79. Instead of considering a simple
cosmological constant, we also consider the possibility of a quintessence
scalar field responsible for the additional energy density of the universe. We
present our constraints on the Omega_x-w plane. We discuss the region allowed
by combined gravitational lensing statistics, high redshift Type Ia supernovae
distances, and globular cluster ages.
  Instead of a cosmological model, we can constrain the redshift distribution
of faint radio sources based on the observed gravitational lensing rate and an
assumed cosmological model. If there are six strongly lensed sources, the 68%
confidence upper limit on the average redshift of radio sources with flux
densities less than 150 mJy at 8.4 GHz is <z> < 1.4 + (Omega-Lambda) \pm 0.1.
In order to obtain a much tighter estimate on the cosmological parameters, it
is essential that the redshift distribution for radio sources at the faint flux
density levels be observationally determined. We strongly recommend that
statistically complete optical spectroscopic programs be carried out to obtain
redshifts for a representative subsample of faint background radio sources.

properties of the source during this period were similar to that of the
Galactic black hole candidates in the intermediate state (corresponding to the
transition between the canonical high and low states). The power law component
of the spectrum gradually hardens with decrease of the source flux in the 3 -
150 keV energy band. The 2 - 10 Hz QPOs were found to be a generic feature of
the power density spectrum in this state. The changes of the QPO centroid
frequency are strongly correlated with the changes of spectral and timing
parameters (in particular parameters of the soft spectral component). This type
of correlation holds on the wide range of time scales (from seconds to months).
Overall trend of the spectral and temporal properties suggests that with
further drop of the source flux (below the values observed during the reported

black hole candidates.
