early G type dwarf stars in the metallicity range -1.06 < [Fe/H] < 0.26 using
the forbidden [C I] line at 8727 A. This line is presumably less sensitive to
temperature, atmospheric structure and departures from LTE than alternative
carbon criteria. We find that [C/Fe] decreases slowly with increasing [Fe/H]
with an overall slope of -0.17 +- 0.03. Our results are consistent with carbon
enrichment by superwinds of metal-rich massive stars but inconsistent with a
main origin of carbon in low-mass stars. This follows in particular from a
comparison between the relation of [C/O] with metallicity for the Galactic
stars and the corresponding relation observed for dwarf irregular galaxies. The
significance of intermediate-mass stars for the production of carbon in the
Galaxy is still somewhat unclear.

YY Dra and V709 Cas which show that V709 Cas, like YY Dra, exhibits a
double-peaked X-ray pulse profile. Neither system shows evidence for X-ray beat
period or orbital modulation, so both must be disc-fed accretors seen at low
inclination angles. We argue that the short spin periods of the white dwarfs in
these objects indicate that they have weak magnetic fields, so the radius at
which material is captured by the field lines is relatively small. Consequently
the footprints of the disc-fed accretion curtains on the white dwarf surface
are large. The optical depths to X-ray emission within the accretion curtains
are therefore lowest in the direction along the magnetic field lines, and
highest in the direction parallel to the white dwarf surface, such that the
emission from the two poles conspires to produce double-peaked X-ray pulse
profiles. We emphasise that such a pulse profile is not a unique indicator of
two-pole accretion however. Indeed, two-pole accretion onto smaller regions of
the white dwarf surface may be considered the `normal' mode of behaviour in a
disc-fed intermediate polar with a longer white dwarf spin period (and
therefore a higher field strength), resulting in a single-peaked pulse profile.
Collating data on other intermediate polars, we may classify them into two
subsets. Fast rotators, with relatively weak fields, show double-peaked pulse
profiles (AE Aqr, DQ Her, XY Ari, GK Per, V709 Cas, YY Dra, V405 Aur), whilst
slower rotators, with larger fields and therefore larger magnetospheres, have
been seen to exhibit an X-ray beat period modulation at some time (FO Aqr, TX
Col, BG CMi, AO Psc, V1223 Sgr, RX J1712.6-2414).

emission lines. The H-alpha intensity provides the emission measure (EM) along

rotation measure, and dispersion measure to study interstellar turbulence.
Observations at high spectral resolution (10 km/s) allow measurements of the
bulk radial velocity structure of the emitting gas and investigations of
thermal and non-thermal (turbulent) broadening mechanisms through the line
widths. By measuring the widths of the H-alpha line and an emission line from a
heavier atom (e.g. the [S II] 6716 line), one can separate the thermal and
non-thermal contributions to the line width. Preliminary studies using this
method have shown that the broad range of H-alpha line widths (typically 15 -
50 km/s) is mostly due to differences in the non-thermal component of the width
and that along many lines of sight this component dominates. The Wisconsin
H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM) is in the process of producing a very sensitive kinematic
map of the northern sky in H-alpha at one degree angular resolution and 12 km/s

variously classified as an extragalactic source, Galactic jet source, and young
supernova remnant. We present new observations of G359.87+0.18 between 0.33 and
15 GHz and use these to argue that this source is an Faranoff-Riley II radio
galaxy. We are able to place a crude limit on its redshift of z > 0.1. The
source has a spectral index \alpha < -1 (S \propto \nu^\alpha), suggestive of a
radio galaxy with a redshift z >~ 2.
  The scattering diameters of Sgr A* and several nearby OH masers (~ 1"" at 1
GHz) indicate that a region of enhanced scattering is along the line of sight
to the Galactic center. If the region covers the Galactic center uniformly, the
implied diameter for a background source is at least 600"" at 0.33 GHz, in
contrast with the observed 20"" diameter of G359.87+0.18. Using the scattering
diameter of a nearby OH maser OH 359.762+0.120 and the widths of two, nearby,
non-thermal threads, G0.08+0.15 and G359.79+0.17, we show that a uniform
scattering region should cover G359.87+0.18. We therefore conclude that the
Galactic center scattering region is inhomogeneous on a scale of 5' (~ 10 pc at
a distance of 8.5 kpc). This scale is comparable to the size scale of molecular
clouds in the Galactic center. The close agreement between these two lengths
scales is an indication that the scattering region is linked intimately to the
Galactic center molecular clouds.

However, recent major observational advances have produced an estimate of the
li6/li7 ratio in a few very old stars in the galactic halo which impacts the
question whether or not the lithium isotopes are depleted in the outer layers
of halo stars, through proton induced reactions at the base of (or below) the
convective zone. li6 is a pure product of spallation through the major
production reactions, fast oxygen and alphas interacting on interstellar H, He
(especially in the early Galaxy). The rapid nuclei are both synthesized and
accelerated by SN II. In this context, the \li6 evolution should go in step
with that of beryllium and boron, recently observed by the Keck and HST
telescopes. Li6 adds a new constraint on the early spallation in the Galaxy. In
particular, if confirmed, the Li6/Be9 ratio observed in two halo stars (HD
84937, BD +263578) gives strong boundary conditions on the composition and the
spectrum of the rapid particles involved. We show that Li6 is essentially
intact in halo stars, and a fortiori \li7. We can define a range of the Li6
abundance in the very early Galaxy consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis

Lac objects are intrinsically similar to the Fanaroff-Riley class II and I
radio galaxies respectively, but appear to be different because they are viewed
at different angles to the line-of-sight. The quasars and BL Lac objects are
observed at small viewing angles while the radio galaxies lie close to the
plane of the sky. In such schemes, the quasar or BL Lac nucleus is hidden from
our view by a putative torus when the source is inclined at a large angle to
the line-of-sight and appears as a radio galaxy. Such a scenario should also
affect the observed polarization properties of the cores, with the cores in the
radio galaxies and weak-cored quasars being less polarized than the
core-dominated quasars and BL Lacs due to Faraday depolarization by the
magnetoionic medium in the obscuring torus or disk. In this paper, we report
that the core polarization of radio galaxies and weak-cored quasars is indeed
much smaller than for the core-dominated quasars and BL Lacs. We suggest that
this is due to the depolarization caused by the obscuring torus or disk,
providing further evidence in favour of the unified schemes.

classical fields of a d-dimensional quantum field theory reappear as low-energy
effective degrees of freedom of the discrete variables, provided the

leptons of the opposite sign and 3 leptons) are investigated . The detection of

SU(5) mSUGRA model as a function of m_0, m_1/2 for 4 sets of model parameters :
tan(beta) = 2 or 35 and sign(mu) = +/- 1 and for fixed value of A_0 = 0. The
CMS detector response is modelled using CMSJET 4.51 fast MC code (non-GEANT).
The results obtained are presented as 5 sigma detection contours in the m_0,
m_1/2 planes and with optimized selection cuts in various regions of the
parameter space. The result of these investigations is that with integrated
luminosity L=10^5 pb^-1 the squark and gluino mass reach is about 2.5 TeV and
covers most of the interesting parts of parameter space according to neutralino
relic density expectations. The influence of signal and background
cross-section uncertainties on the reach contours is estimated. The effect of
pile-up on signal and background is also discussed. This effect is found to be

suggests the existence of (at least) one sort, $\nu_s $, of sterile neutrinos,
whose mixing with $\nu_e$ would be responsible for the observed deficit. In the
last Section, promising perspectives for applying the same form of mass matrix
to quarks are outlined. Two independent predictions of $|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}| =
0.0753 \pm 0.0032 $ and unitary angle $\gamma \simeq 70^\circ $ are deduced
from the experimental values of $|V_{us}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ (with the use of
quark masses $ m_s $, $ m_c $ and $ m_b $).

coherent phases can have a strong influence on the phase separation
(coarsening) of alloys. If the elastic moduli are different in the two phases,
the elastic interactions may accelerate, slow down or even stop the phase
separation process. If the material is elastically anisotropic, the
precipitates can be shaped like plates or needles instead of spheres and can
form regular precipitate superlattices. Tensions or compressions applied
externally to the specimen may have a strong effect on the shapes and
arrangement of the precipitates. In this paper, we review the main theoretical
approaches that have been used to model these effects and we relate them to
experimental observations. The theoretical approaches considered are (i)
`macroscopic' models treating the two phases as elastic media separated by a
sharp interface (ii) `mesoscopic' models in which the concentration varies
continuously across the interface (iii) `microscopic' models which use the
positions of individual atoms.

algorithm is developed for electron/positron identification in a wide momentum
region (10 - 300 GeV/c). The method was proposed for the Transition Radiation
Detector of the E781 experiment at Fermilab. The package consists of two parts:
  - the program for the ANN training;
  - the particle classification subroutine.
  Both parts are built using the object oriented technique and C++ language.
The particle identification algorithm is wrapped in FORTRAN closers to be used
in the E781 off-line program. The package performance was tested in comparison
with the likelihood ratio method using Monte Carlo generated data. Our study
has demonstrated the excellent ability of the ANN to learn even small details
of the detector response function. The ANN solution gives the same performance
and behavior as the likelihood method when using Monte Carlo data with known
detector parameters. It demonstrates that if trained with experimental data the
package can provide a very good solution to the classification problem of
$e^+/e^-$ tracks.

basis set approach to solving the Hartree--Fock self-consistent field
equations, combined with an ``exact'' stochastic method to estimate the
residual basis set truncation error and electron correlation effects. We also
discuss the applicability of the adiabatic approximation to strongly magnetized

differential equations obtained by similarity reduction from the modified
Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. Its first member is the well-known second
Painlev\'e equation, P2.
  In this paper we use this hierarchy in order to illustrate our application of
the truncation procedure in Painlev\'e analysis to ordinary differential
equations. We extend these techniques in order to derive auto-B\""acklund
transformations for the second Painlev\'e hierarchy. We also derive a number of
other B\""acklund transformations, including a B\""acklund transformation onto a
hierarchy of P34 equations, and a little known B\""acklund transformation for P2
itself.
  We then use our results on B\""acklund transformations to obtain, for each
member of the P2 hierarchy, a sequence of special integrals.
