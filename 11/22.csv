neutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova
core over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic
radiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order
hours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in
the intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a
supernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a
supernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical
observations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic
assessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance
of the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward
scattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in
the presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.
Even with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and
the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to
be within circles of radius $5^\circ$ and $20^\circ$, respectively. Other
reactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful
for locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of
triangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an
arrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics
we show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a
good determination of the supernova direction.

could form spectral index, energy and magnetic field maps. We find that all but
one galaxy show evidence for non-thermal high latitude radio continuum
emission, suggesting that cosmic ray halos are common in star forming galaxies.
The high latitude emission is seen over a variety of spatial scales and in
discrete and/or smooth features. In general, the discrete features emanate from
the disk, but estimates of CR diffusion lengths suggest that diffusion alone is
insufficient to transport the particles to the high latitudes seen (> 15 kpc in
one case). Thus CRs likely diffuse through low density regions and/or are
assisted by other mechanisms (e.g. winds). We searched for correlations between
the prevalence of high latitude radio emission and a number of other
properties, including the global SFR, supernova input rate per unit star
forming, and do not find clear correlations with any of these properties.

confinement. It was found that a dust mixture of silicon nanoparticles, bare
graphite grains, silicate core-organic refractory mantle grains and three-layer
silicate-water ice-organic refractory grains works well in explaining the
extinction and, in addition, results in the acceptable fractions of UV/visible
photons absorbed by silicon nanoparticles: 0.071-0.081. Since these fractions
barely agree with the fraction of UV/visible photons needed to excite the
observed ERE, we conclude that the intrinsic photon conversion efficiency of

restored by heating above the charge-ordering transition temperature and

the finite correlation length of the charge-ordered state. Together with the
