with a variable gravitational constant and bulk viscosity. We have found that
the strength of gravity has changed appreciably in the early universe. The
gravitational constant attained its greatest value at t=10^{-23} sec after the
Big Bang. PBHs formed at the GUT and electroweak epochs would have masses about
$1.85\times 10^9 g$ and $1.8\times 10^{-7} g$ respectively. Their temperatures
when they explode are $6\times 10^8K$ and 6 K respectively. PBHs formed during
nuclear epoch are hard to detect at the present time. The gravitational
constant ($G$) is found to increase as $G\propto t^2$ in the radiation epoch.
The gamma rays bursts (GRBs) may have their origin in the evaporation of the
PBHs formed during GUT time.

--rising more steeply on one side of the galaxy than on the other-- is the
signature of the kinematic lopsidedness. It is shown that kinematic
lopsidedness may be related to lopsidedness in the potential, and that even a
mild perturbation in the latter can produce significant kinematical effects.
Probably at least half of all spiral galaxies are lopsided.

log(H_0) vs. ``normalized distance'' diagram. Analytical expressions, under the
simplifying assumption of a normal distribution and the use of the correct TF
slope, are derived for the resulting biases, especially the average bias which
log(V_M) cutoffs produce in the derived value of H_0. This bias is shown to be
relatively weak, and as such cannot explain the large differences in the
reported values of H_0 derived from direct and inverse TF relations.
  Some problems of slope and calibration are shown to be more serious. In
particular, one consequence of fitting through the calibrators either the slope
relevant for field galaxies or the steeper slope followed by calibrators is
that the derived value of the Hubble constant comes to depend on the nature of
the calibrator sample. If the calibrator sample is not representative of the
cosmic distribution of log(V_M), large errors in the derived value of H_0 are
possible. Analytical expressions are given for this error that we term the

In the weak-field approximation, we show that the contribution to the

scalar-tensor theories contrast with general relativity, which predicts that
the only first-order effect is due to the spectral shift. Moreover, we find

always valid for scalar and pseudoscalar resonances, although the usual version
of the formula is not entirely correct. For resonances with nonzero spins the
factorization does not generally take place. We deal in more detail with the
spin-one case, where we show a condition on the decay matrix element that
ensures the validity of the same factorizing formula as in the spinless case.
This condition is satisfied for rho --> pi pi but not, e.g., for K* --> pi K or
a1 --> pi rho. The formalism is applied also to the case when the resonance is
produced not in two-body collisions but in the decay of a heavier particle or
resonance (chain decay). Application of our formulas to the e+e- production in

holomorphic model has no known stable minimal-energy solution for n greater

STIRAP, the Stokes pulse arrives before the pump pulse, but unlike STIRAP, the
two pulses terminate simultaneously while maintaining a constant ratio of
amplitudes. The independence of f-STIRAP from details of pulse shape and pulse
area makes it the analog of conventional STIRAP in the creation of coherent

requires only two laser pulses (which can be derived from a single laser) and
