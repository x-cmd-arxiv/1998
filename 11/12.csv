nucleosynthesis in which Li, Be, and B are produced (predominantly) by the
inelastic scattering of accelerated protons and \alpha's off of CNO nuclei in
the ambient interstellar medium. If O/Fe is constant at low metallicities, then
the Li6 vs Fe/H evolution-as well as Be and B vs Fe/H-has difficulty in
matching the observations. However, recent determinations of Population II
oxygen abundances, as measured via OH lines, indicate that O/Fe increases at
lower metallicity; if this trend is confirmed, then the Li6 evolution in a
standard model of cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis is consistent with the data. We
also show that another key indicator of Li6BeB origin is the Li6/Be ratio which
also fits the available data if O/Fe is not constant at low metallicity.
Finally we note that Li6 evolution in this scenario can strongly constrain the
degree to which Li6 and Li7 are depleted in halo stars.

the dark matter around our Galaxy in the form of Massive Compact Halo Objects

background star, the gravitational deflection of light causes an apparent
brightening of the star, i.e. a gravitational `microlensing' event. Such events
will be very rare, so millions of stars must be monitored for many years. We
describe our search for microlensing using a very large CCD camera on the
dedicated 1.27m telescope at Mt. Stromlo, Australia: currently some 14 events
have been discovered towards the Large Magellanic Cloud. The lack of
short-timescale events excludes planetary mass MACHOs as a major contributor to
the dark matter, but the observed long events (durations 1--6 months) suggest
that a major fraction may be in fairly massive objects $\sim 0.5 \Msun$. It is
currently difficult but not impossible to explain these events by other lens
populations; we discuss some prospects for clarifying the nature of the lenses.

discs around white dwarfs to study the structure and properties of transition
fronts in the context of the thermal-viscous disc instability model. The
thermal structure of cooling and heating fronts is dominated by radiative
cooling and viscous heating, respectively, except in a very narrow precursor
region in heating fronts where advection and radial transport of energy
dominate. Cooling fronts are much broader than heating fronts, but the widths
of both types of fronts scale with the local vertical scale height of the disc.
We confirm that during a fair fraction of the propagation time of a cooling
front, the structure of the inner disc is close to self-similar. The speed of
heating fronts is ~ a few km/s, while the speed of cooling fronts is ~ a
fraction of a km/s. We show that direct measurements of the speed of transition
fronts probably cannot discriminate between various prescriptions proposed for
the viscosity parameter alpha. A natural prediction of the disc instability
model is that fronts decelerate as they propagate in the disc, independent of
the prescription for alpha. Observation of this effect would confirm that dwarf
nova outbursts are driven by the thermal-viscous instability. Most of our
results also apply to low mass X-ray binaries in which the accreting object is
a neutron star or a black hole.

technique, although the currently existing methods present several shortcomings
which hinder their application. Here it is shown that most of those drawbacks
are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to
this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization
allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions
or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases
when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate'
the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an
excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the
predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z_spec) = 0.08 up to z<6
and no systematic biases nor outliers. The reliability of the method is further
tested by restricting the color information to the UBVI filters. The results
thus obtained are shown to be more reliable than those of standard techniques
even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed
here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of
photometric redshifts. Several applications are outlined, e.g. the estimation
of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or
the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large
multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to
develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which
simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and
photometric redshifts.

  Mod. Phys. C (1999)",,"10.1142/S0129183199000115",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  A one-dimensional cellular automaton with a probabilistic evolution rule can
generate stochastic surface growth in $(1 + 1)$ dimensions. Two such discrete
models of surface growth are constructed from a probabilistic cellular
automaton which is known to show a transition from a active phase to a
absorbing phase at a critical probability associated with two particular
components of the evolution rule. In one of these models, called model $A$ in
this paper, the surface growth is defined in terms of the evolving front of the
cellular automaton on the space-time plane. In the other model, called model
$B$, surface growth takes place by a solid-on-solid deposition process
controlled by the cellular automaton configurations that appear in successive
time-steps. Both the models show a depinning transition at the critical point
of the generating cellular automaton. In addition, model $B$ shows a kinetic
roughening transition at this point. The characteristics of the surface width
in these models are derived by scaling arguments from the critical properties
of the generating cellular automaton and by Monte Carlo simulations.

utilized in the literature to describe this crossover above the superconducting
critical temperature, and show that it fails to yield the correct behaviour of
the system in the strong-coupling limit, where composite bosons form as tightly
bound fermion pairs. We then set up the correct approximation for a ``dilute''

be considered in the place of the fermionic T-matrix approximation for the
self-energy. This new class of diagrams correctly describes both the weak- and
strong-coupling limits, and consequently results into an improved interpolation
scheme for the intermediate (crossover) region. In this context, we provide
also a systematic mapping between the corresponding diagrammatic theories for
the composite bosons and the constituent fermions. As a preliminary result to
demonstrate the numerical effect of our new class of diagrams on physical

Depending upon their domain of definition, these indicators could be local or

particular, we look at the temporal asymptotic behaviour of these indicators
and ask under what conditions, and for which class of models, they evolve
monotonically in time. We find that for the case of ever-expanding models,
there is a larger class of indicators that grow monotonically with time,
whereas the corresponding class for the recollapsing models is more restricted.
Nevertheless, in the absence of decaying modes, indicators exist which grow
monotonically with time for both ever-expanding and recollapsing models
simultaneously. On the other hand, no such indicators may found which grow
monotonically if the decaying modes are allowed to exist. We also find the
conditions for these indicators to be non-divergent at the initial singularity
in both models. Our results can be of potential relevance for understanding
structure formation in inhomogeneous settings and in debates regarding
gravitational entropy and arrow of time. In particular, the spatial dependence
of turning points in inhomogeneous cosmologies may result in multiple density
contrast arrows in recollapsing models over certain epochs. We also find that
different notions of asymptotic homogenisation may be deduced, depending upon
the density contrast indicators used.

probability theory we derive an expression for the expected pair separation

in PSH's are due to translations, whereas other isometries manifest as tiny
deformations of the PSH corresponding to the simply connected case. This result
holds for all Robertson-Walker spacetimes and gives rise to two basic
corollaries: (i) that PSH's of Euclidean manifolds that have the same
translations in their covering groups exhibit identical spike spectra of
topological origin, making clear that even if the universe is flat the
topological spikes alone are not sufficient for determining its topology; and
(ii) that PSH's of hyperbolic 3-manifolds exhibit no spikes of topological
origin. These corollaries ensure that cosmic crystallography, as originally
formulated, is not a conclusive method for unveiling the shape of the universe.

The solution of a boundary value problem is thus reduced to the identification
of the jump data of the Riemann-Hilbert problem from the boundary data. But
even if this can be achieved,it is very difficult to get explicit solutions
since the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem is equivalent to an integral equation.
In the case of the Ernst equation (the stationary axisymmetric Einstein
equations in vacuum), it was shown in a previous work that the matrix problem
is gauge equivalent to a scalar problem on a Riemann surface. If the jump data
of the original problem are rational functions, this surface will be compact
which makes it possible to give explicit solutions in terms of hyperelliptic
theta functions. In the present work, we discuss Riemann-Hilbert problems on
Riemann surfaces in the framework of fibre bundles. This makes it possible to
treat the compact and the non-compact case in the same setting and to apply

before any time at which we have reliable observations constraining the

inflation (sometimes called thermal inflation) at a lower energy scale than
standard inflation, or a short epoch of early matter domination, cannot be
ruled out by present cosmological data. The cosmological stochastic
gravitational wave background, on scales accessible to interferometer
detection, is sensitive to non-standard cosmologies of this type. We consider
the implications of such alternative models both for ground-based experiments
such as LIGO and space-based proposals such as LISA. We show that a second
burst of inflation leads to a scale-dependent reduction in the spectrum.
Applied to conventional inflation, this further reduces an already
disappointingly low signal. In the pre big bang scenario, where a much more
potent signal is possible, the amplitude is reduced but the background remains
observable by LISA in certain parameter space regions. In each case, a second
epoch of inflation induces oscillatory features into the spectrum in a manner
analogous to the acoustic peaks in the density perturbation spectrum. On LIGO
scales, perturbations can only survive through thermal inflation with
detectable amplitudes if their amplitudes were at one time so large that linear
perturbation theory is inadequate. Although for an epoch of early matter
domination the reduction in the expected signal is not as large as the one
caused by a second burst of inflation, the detection in the context of the pre
big bang scenario may not be possible since the spectrum peaks around the LIGO
frequency window and for lower frequencies behaves as $f^3$.

the solution of a set of linear and homogeneous Diophantine equations whose
elementary solutions represent ``elementary couplings''. Grobner bases provide
a tool for generating the complete set of relations between elementary

Dirac equation. The classical trajectories that enter the expressions are
determined by the dynamics of relativistic point particles. We carefully
investigate the transport of the spin degrees of freedom along the trajectories
which can be understood geometrically as parallel transport in a vector bundle
with SU(2) holonomy. Furthermore, we give an interpretation in terms of a
classical spin vector that is transported along the trajectories and whose
dynamics, dictated by the equation of Thomas precession, gives rise to
dynamical and geometric phases every orbit is weighted by. We also present an
analogous approach to the Pauli equation which we analyse in two different
limits.

KP hierarchy are shown to satisfy eigenvalue equations for a commutative ring
of translational operators in the spectral parameter. In the rational limit,
these translational operators converge to the differential operators in the
spectral parameter previously discussed as part of the theory of
""bispectrality"". Consequently, these translational operators can be seen as
demonstrating a form of bispectrality for the non-rational solitons as well.
