substructure, which implies that merging between clusters and subclusters is a
rather common physical process of cluster formation.
  It still remains unclear how cluster merging affects the evolution of cluster
member galaxies.
  We report the results of numerical simulations, which show the dynamical
evolution of a gas-rich late-type spiral in a merger between a small group of
galaxies and a cluster. The simulations demonstrate that time-dependent tidal
gravitational field of the merging excites non-axisymmetric structure of the
galaxy, subsequently drives efficient transfer of gas to the central region,
and finally triggers a secondary starburst.
  This result provides not only a new mechanism of starbursts but also a close
physical relationship between the emergence of starburst galaxies and the
formation of substructure in clusters. We accordingly interpret post-starburst
galaxies located near substructure of the Coma cluster as one observational
example indicating the global tidal effects of group-cluster merging.
  Our numerical results furthermore suggest a causal link between the observed
excess of blue galaxies in distant clusters and cluster virialization process
through hierarchical merging of subclusters.

monotonic and non-monotonic transfer functions is analyzed in the unstable
regions with the following main finding; non-monotonic functions can produce
robust chaos whereas monotonic functions generate fragile chaos only. In the
case of non-monotonic functions, the number of positive Lyapunov exponents
increases as a function of one of the free parameters in the model, hence, high
dimensional chaotic attractors can be generated. We extend the analysis to a
combination of monotonic and non-monotonic functions.

problem of minimizing the $L^1$-norm of the gradient on $\Omega$ of a function

strictly positive mean curvature of the boundary $\partial\Omega$, we show
existence of a continuous solution, with H\""older exponent half of that of data

  This generalizes previous results obtained for the unconstrained and
double-obstacle problems. The main new feature in the present analysis is the
need to extend various maximum principles from the case of two area-minimizing
sets to the case of one sub- and one superminimizing set. This we accomplish
subject to a weak regularity assumption on one of the sets, sufficient to carry
out the analysis. Interesting open questions include the uniqueness of
solutions and a complete analysis of the regularity properties of area
superminimizing sets. We provide some preliminary results in the latter
direction, namely a new monotonicity principle for superminimizing sets, and
the existence of ``foamy'' superminimizers in two dimensions.
