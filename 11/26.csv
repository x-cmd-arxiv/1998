average evolution has been obtained. It has been demonstrated numerically that
for purely noise-induced transitions (transitions over potential barriers) the
time evolution of mean coordinate is a simple exponent with a good precision
even for the case when the potential barrier height is comparable or smaller

heterogeneous agents are rewarded for being in a minority group. Each agent
possesses a number of fixed strategies each of which are predictors of the next
minority group. The strategies use a set of aggregate, publicly available
information (reflecting the agents' collective previous decisions) to make
their predictions. An agent chooses which group to join at a given moment by
using one of his strategies. These games are adaptive in that agents can
choose, at different points of the game, to exercise different strategies in
making their choice of which group to join. We find, rather generally, that
such systems evidence a phase change from a maladaptive, informationally
efficient phase in which the system performs poorly at generating resources, to
an inefficient phase in which there is an emergent cooperation among the
agents, and the system more effectively generates resources. The best emergent
coordination is achieved in a transition region between these two phases. This
transition occurs when the dimension of the strategy space is of the order of
the number of agents playing the game. We present explanations for this general
behavior, based in part on an information theoretic analysis of the system and
its publicly available information. We also propose a mean-field like model of
the game which is most accurate in the maladaptive, efficient phase. In
addition, we show that the best individual agent performance in the two
different phases is achieved by sets of strategies with markedly different
characteristics. We discuss implications of our results for various aspects of
the study of complex adaptive systems.

  Workshop on 'Chemical Evolution from Zero to High Redshift', October 1998",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The relevance of galaxies of different luminosity and mass for the chemical
enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM) is analysed. For this purpose, I
adopt the composite luminosity function of cluster galaxies from Trentham

adopting a universal Salpeter IMF - is calibrated on reproducing the
M_Fe/L_tot, M_Fe/M_*, and alpha/Fe ratios observed in clusters. Although the
contribution to total luminosity and ICM metals peaks around L* galaxies (M*
approx -20), faint objects with M_B>-18 still provide at least 30 per cent of
the metals present in the ICM. In consistency with the solar alpha/Fe ratios
determined by {ASCA}, the model predicts that 60 per cent of the ICM iron comes
from Type Ia supernovae. The predicted slope of the relation between
intracluster gas mass and cluster luminosity emerges shallower than the
observed one, indicating that the fraction of primordial gas increases with
cluster richness.

cold, in particular in the regions outside the massive, virialized clusters of
galaxies. If our local cosmic environment is taken to be a representative
volume of the Universe, the repercussion of this finding is that either we live
in a low-$\Omega$ Universe and/or that the galaxy distribution is a biased
reflection of the underlying mass distribution. Otherwise, the pronounced
nature of the observed galaxy distribution would be irreconcilable with the
relatively quiet flow of the galaxies.
  Here we propose a different view on this cosmic dilemma, stressing the fact
that our cosmic neighbourhood embodies a region of rather particular dynamical
properties, and henceforth we are apt to infer flawed conclusions with respect
to the global Universe. Suspended between two huge mass concentrations, the
Great Attractor region and the Perseus-Pisces chain, we find ourselves in a
region of relatively low density yet with a very strong tidal shear. This tidal
field induces a local velocity field with a significant large-scale bulk flow
but a low small-scale velocity dispersion. By means of constrained realizations
of our local Universe, consisting of Wiener-filtered reconstructions inferred
from the Mark III catalogue of galaxy peculiar velocities in combination with
appropriate spectrally determined fluctuations, we study the implications for
our local velocity field. We find that we live near a local peak in the
distribution of the cosmic Mach number, $|v_{bulk}|/\sigma_v$, and that our
local cosmic niche is located in the tail of the Mach number distribution
function.

variety of observational evidence is broadly consistent with the merging
scenario of hierarchical structure formation models, but the stellar population
properties of ellipticals pose some challanges. The formation of ellipticals
must have always involved some dissipation. The gas fraction at the last major
merger event presumably has strong influence on their present day properties.
Most elliptical galaxies are old systems, but disky ellipticals might be
younger than boxy objects and have more extended star formation histories. The
small scatter and the redshift variations of the scaling relation are
compatible with passive evolution. The high Mg/Fe overabundances of luminous
(boxy) ellipticals point to a rapid star formation episode, while
low-luminosity objects have values of Mg/Fe nearly solar, allowing for an
extended star formation history.

over-production predicted by the CDM model. In this case we compare the X-ray

Evrard's (1990) prescriptions for the mass-temperature relation, taking also
account of the non-radial motions, with Henry & Arnaud (1991) and Edge et al.

particle interacting with its environment is being investigated intensively.
This has an important bearing on a plausible causal connection between
incoherent c-axis resistivity and high-temperature superconductivity. In our
work we study the tunnel supression and incoherent motion of a particle
tunneling between two sites. The bosonic excitations of the environment are
coupled to only one site inducing on-site spin flips. We show that this on-site
spin flip scattering makes the tunnel motion incoherent. In the
high-temperature limit incoherent rate or hopping rate has been calculated. We
also briefly discuss the renormalization of the effective tunneling by
environmental coupling at zero temperature following Wegner's renormalization
group procedure.

evolution of a free Klein-Gordon field on a flat spacetime (with toroidal
Cauchy surfaces) starting from a flat initial surface and ending on a generic
final surface. The associated Bogolubov transformation is computed; it does not
correspond to a unitary transformation on the Fock space. This means that
functional evolution of the quantum state as originally envisioned by Tomonaga,
Schwinger, and Dirac is not a viable concept. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that
functional evolution of the quantum state can be satisfactorily described using
the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory. We discuss possible

for having a crossing is 1/2. Fix an $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. For each edge $e$, let

similar to those of the neighboring isotopes. By means of the axially-symmetric

being nearly 0.3, between the proton orbits originating from the orbits

was an intruder orbit originating from below the energy gap at Z=50, rising
higher in energy with the deformation and intruding the Z=50-82 shell. These
two orbits have the largest magnitude of the quadrupole moment with a different
sign among the orbits near and below the Fermi surface. Occupancy and
non-occupancy of these orbits by protons thus affect B(E2:0_1^+ -> 2_1^+)

types like human melanocytes (=pigment cells of the skin), human fibroblasts

elastic energy is derived and the orientational defects (disclination) of
nematic liquid crystals are investigated. The existence of half-numbered
disclinations show that the nematic phase has an apolar symmetry. The density-
and order parameter dependence of the orientational elastic constants and their
absolute values are estimated. From the defect structure, one finds that the
splay elastic constant is smaller than the bend elastic constant (melanocytes).

symmetry or occupied by another cell type.

now primarily known for its parallel publication of essentially the same
gravitational field equations of general relativity which Einstein published in
a note on ``The Field Equations of Gravitation,'' five days later, on November
25, 1915. An intense correspondence between Hilbert and Einstein in the crucial
month of November 1915, furthermore, confronts the historian with a case of
parallel research and with the associated problem of reconstructing the
interaction between Hilbert and Einstein at that time.
  Previous assessments of these issues have recently been challenged by Leo
Corry, J\""urgen Renn, and John Stachel who draw attention to a hitherto
unnoticed first set of proofs for Hilbert's note. These proofs bear a printer's
stamp of December 6 and display substantial differences to the published
version. By focussing on the consequences of these findings for the
reconstruction of Einstein's path towards general relativity, a number of
questions about Hilbert's role in the episode, however, are left open. To what
extent did Hilbert react to Einstein? What were Hilbert's research concerns in
his note, and how did they come to overlap with Einstein's to some extent in
the fall of 1915? How did Hilbert and Einstein regard each other and their
concurrent activities at the time? What did Hilbert hope to achieve, and what,
after all, did he achieve?
  With these questions in mind I discuss in this paper Hilbert's first note on
the ``Foundations of Physics,'' its prehistory and characteristic features,
and, for heuristic purposes, I do so largely from Hilbert's perspective.
