a Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy for which Mason et al. (1996) reported
evidence for a line-emitting region ""intermediate"" (both in terms of velocity
and density) between the conventional broad and narrow line regions (BLR and
NLR, respectively). From our observations and modelling of the spectra, we get
a consistent decomposition of the line profiles into four components: an
extended H II region with unresolved lines, two distinct Seyfert-type clouds
identified with the NLR, and a relatively narrow ""broad line"" component
emitting only Balmer lines but no forbidden lines. Therefore, and although we
find this object to be exceptional in having line-emission from the BLR with
almost the same width as the narrow lines, our interpretation of the data does
not support the existence of an ""intermediate"" line region (ILR).

For the power-law models, we use numerical data averaged over several different
output times: ten output times from two N-body realizations for the n=-1
power-law model; four outputs from one realization for the n=0 model. While for
the SCDM model, we consider four outputs separately at redshifts z = 0, 0.43,
1.14 and 1.86 from one large N-body simulations. The comparison results show
that our mass function fits the numerical data in a much improved way over the

preferentially located in dynamically complex systems. Also, the velocity
distribution of the NAT galaxies is similar to that of other cluster members;
these velocities are inadequate for producing the ram pressure necessary to
bend the radio jets. We therefore propose a new model for NAT formation, in
which NATs are associated with dynamically complex clusters undergoing merger
events. The U-shaped NAT morphology is produced in part by the merger-induced
bulk motion of the ICM bending the jets.

the chemical properties of distant star-forming galaxies. However, standard
nebular chemical abundance measurement methods (those with a measured electron
temperature from [O III] lambda4363) may be subject to small systematic errors
when the observed volume includes a mixture of gas with diverse temperatures,
ionization parameters, and metallicities. To characterize these systematic
effects, we compare physical conditions derived from spectroscopy of individual
H II regions with results from global galaxy spectroscopy. We consider both
low-mass, metal poor galaxies with uniform abundances and larger galaxies with
internal chemical gradients. Well-established empirical calibrations using
strong-line ratios can serve as reliable (~0.2 dex) indicators of the overall
systemic oxygen abundance even when the signal-to-noise of the Hbeta and [O

characterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such

Under such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow
have been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present
an algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and
apply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling
correction. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in
valid words, such as substituting ""to"" for ""too"", ""casual"" for ""causal"", etc.
We evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a
statistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We
find: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves
accuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the
pruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the
literature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason
that WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear
separator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the

using a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the

orientable 3-manifold. Culler and Shalen defined norm on H_1(dM;R) using the
SL(2,C) character variety of pi_1(M). The Culler-Shalen norm encodes many
topological properties of M; in particular it provides information about Dehn
fillings of M. Their construction may be applied to arbitrary curves in the
SL_2(C)-character variety of a connected, compact, orientable, irreducible
3-manifold whose boundary is a torus, though in this generality one can only
guarantee that it will define a seminorm.
  The first half of this paper is devoted to the development of the general
theory of Culler-Shalen seminorms defined for curves of PSL_2(C)-characters. By
working over PSL_2(C) we obtain a theory that is more generally applicable than
its SL_2(C) counterpart, while being only mildly more difficult to set up.
  In the second half of this paper we apply the theory of Culler-Shalen
seminorms to study the Dehn filling operation. In particular we examine the
relationship between fillings which yield manifolds having a positive
dimensional PSL_2(C)-character variety with those that yield manifolds having a
finite or cyclic fundamental group. In one interesting application of this work
we show that manifolds resulting from a nonintegral surgery on a knot in the
3-sphere tend to have a zero-dimensional PSL_2(C)-character variety. As a
consequence we obtain an infinite family of closed, orientable, hyperbolic
Haken manifolds which have zero-dimensional PSL_2(C)-character varieties.

time in incompressible fluid flows. It is well known that the answer is ``no''
in the case of Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in dimension two. In dimension
three it is still an open problem for these equations.
  In this paper we focus on a two-dimensional active scalar model for the 3D
Euler vorticity equation. Constantin, Majda and Tabak suggested, by studying
rigorous theorems and detailed numerical experiments, a general principle: ``If
the level set topology in the temperature field for the 2D quasi-geostrophic
active scalar in the region of strong scalar gradients does not contain a
hyperbolic saddle, then no finite time singularity is possible.''
  Numerical simulations showed evidence of singular behavior when the geometry
of the level sets of the active scalar contain a hyperbolic saddle. There is a
naturally associated notion of simple hyperbolic saddle breakdown. The main
theorem we present in this paper shows that such breakdown cannot occur in
finite time. We also show that the angle of the saddle cannot close in finite
time and it cannot be faster than a double exponential in time. Using the same
techniques, we see that analogous results hold for incompressible 2D and 3D
Euler.

  \sum_{a^2 + b^4\le x} \Lambda(a^2 + b^4) = 4\pi^{-1}\kappa x^{3/4} (1 +
O(\log\log x / \log x))
  where a, b run over positive integers and \kappa = \int^1_0 (1 - t^4)^{1/2}

demonstrated by verifying it (and the other axioms) to produce primes in the

(2) 148 (1998), no. 3, 803-893",,"Annals migration 4-2001","math.LO",,"  We present a coherent collection of finite mathematical theorems some of
which can only be proved by going well beyond the usual axioms for mathematics.
The proofs of these theorems illustrate in clear terms how one uses the well
studied higher infinities of abstract set theory called large cardinals in an
essential way in order to derive results in the context of the natural numbers.
The findings raise the specific issue of what consitutes a valid mathematical
proof and the general issue of objectivity in mathematics in a down to earth
way.
  Large cardinal axioms, which go beyond the usual axioms for mathematics, have
been commonly used in abstract set theory since the 1960's. We believe that the
results reported on here are the early stages of an evolutionary process in
which new axioms for mathematics will be commonly used in an essential way in
the more concrete parts of mathematics.

here a structure for the set \Pi_u(G) of equivalence classes of irreducible
unitary representations of G. (The subscript u will be used throughout to
indicate structures related to unitary representations.) We decompose
\Pi_{u}(G) into disjoint subsets with a (very explicit) discrete parameter set
\Lambda_u: \Pi_u(G) = \bigcup_{\lambda_u \in \Lambda_u} \Pi_u^{\lambda_u}(G).
Each subset is identified conjecturally with a collection of unitary
representations of a certain subgroup G(\lambda_u) of G. (We will give strong
evidence and partial results for this conjecture.) In this way the problem of
classifying \Pi_u(G) would be reduced (by induction on the dimension of G) to
the case G(\lambda_u) = G.

above DWIA representation is contained in the GRS series to the same order.
There is an additional term in the GRS series that is missing in the DWIA due
to the eikonal approximations in the latter. This strongly suggests that the
two approaches, when treated exactly, produce identical structure function to
arbitrary order in $1/q$.
