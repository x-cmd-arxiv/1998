The Coriolis force is the source of linear stabilization in differential
rotation. We exploit the formal equivalence of constant angular momentum flows
and simple Cartesian shear to examine the transition from stability to
nonlinear instability. The manifestation of nonlinear instability in shear
flows is known to be sensitive to initial perturbation and to the amount of
viscosity; marginally (linearly) stable differentially rotating flows exhibit
this same sensitivity. Keplerian systems, however, are completely stable; the
strength of the stabilizing Coriolis force easily overwhelms any destabilizing
nonlinear effects. In fact, nonlinear effects speed the decay of applied
turbulence by producing a rapid cascade of energy to high wavenumbers where
dissipation occurs. Our conclusions are tested with grid resolution experiments
and by comparison with results from a code that employs an alternative
numerical algorithm. The properties of hydrodynamic differential rotation are
contrasted with magnetohydrodynamic differential rotation. The kinetic stress
couples to the vorticity which limits turbulence, while the magnetic stress
couples to the shear which promotes turbulence. Thus magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence is uniquely capable of acting as a turbulent angular momentum
transport mechanism in disks.

Galactic Black Hole Candidates (GBHCs) in their hard state, suggestive that
both classes of objects have similar physical processes. While it appears that
an accretion disk corona (ADC) model, where the corona sandwiches the cold
accretion disk, is capable of explaining the observations of Seyfert galaxies,
recent work has shown that this model is problematic for GBHCs. To address the
differences in the spectra of Seyferts and GBHCs, we consider the structure of
the atmosphere of the accretion disk in a region near an active magnetic flare
(we refer to this region as transition layer). We show that the transition
layer is subject to a thermal instability. Due to the much higher ionizing
X-ray flux in GBHCs, the only stable solution for the upper layer of the
accretion disk is that in which it is highly ionized and is at the Compton
temperature ($kT \sim $ a few keV). Using numerical simulations for a slab
geometry ADC, we show that the presence of a transition layer can significantly
alter the spectrum of escaping radiation for modest optical depths. The
presence of the transition layer also leads to a reduction in reprocessing
features, i.e., the iron line and the X-ray reflection hump. We find that due
to the thermal instability of the surface of the accretion disk, which leads to
different endpoints for GBHCs and Seyfert galaxies, the X-ray spectra from
these two types of objects can be explained by a single unifying ADC model.

morphology of evolved stellar disks indicates a simple classification scheme:
the dominant Fourier m-mode in the dust penetrated regime, and the associated
pitch angle. On the basis of deprojected K$'$ (2.1$\mu m$) images, we propose
that the evolved stellar disks may be grouped into three principal dust

pitch angles at K$'$ of $\sim$ 10$^{\circ}$ (the $\alpha$ class), an
intermediate group with pitch angles of $\sim$ 25$^{\circ}$ (the $\beta$ class)

bin. Any specific dust penetrated archetype may be the resident disk of {\it

sources are detected with the HRI (some being resolvable with the PSPC), the

being instead due to fluctuations within the X-ray structure of the disk. The
source close to the center of the galaxy is extended (L_x = 1e39 erg/s in the

equivalent width as a function of both the column density derived from the
photoelectric cutoff and the 2-10 keV flux normalized to the [OIII] optical
line flux (the latter corrected for extinction and assumed to be a true
indicator of the source intrinsic luminosity). We find that the hard X-ray
properties of type 2 objects depend on a single parameter, the absorbing column
density along the line of sight,in accordance with the unified model. The
diagram can be used to identify Compton thick sources and to isolate and study
peculiar objects. From this analysis we have obtained a column density
distribution of Seyfert 2 galaxies which is thought to be a good approximation
of the real distribution. A large population of heavily absorbed objects is
discovered, including many Compton thick candidates. Our results indicate that
the mean Log Nh/cm^(-2)in type 2 Seyferts is 23.5 and that as much as 23-30% of
sources have Nh > 10^24 cm^(-2).

of the radio lobes for a sample of nearby FRII radio galaxies. In
Dennett-Thorpe et al. (1997) we studied a sample of quasars and found that the
high surface brightness regions had flatter spectra on the jet side (explicable
as a result of Doppler beaming) whilst the extended regions had spectral
asymmetries dependent on lobe length. Unified schemes predict that asymmetries
due to beaming will be much smaller in narrow-line radio galaxies than in
quasars: we therefore investigate in a similar manner, a sample of radio
galaxies with detected jets. We find that spectral asymmetries in these objects
are uncorrelated with jet sidedness at all brightness levels, but depend on
relative lobe volume. Our results are not in conflict with unified schemes, but
suggest that the differences between the two samples are due primarily to power
or redshift, rather than to orientation. We also show directly that hotspot
spectra steepen as a function of radio power or redshift. Whilst a shift in
observed frequency due to the redshift may account for some of the steepening,
it cannot account for all of it, and a dependence on radio power is required.

probabilistic cellular automata models and interacting monomer-dimer models.
These models exhibit a continuous transition from an active phase into an

In the active phase, the interface spreads ballistically into the absorbing
regions and the interface width diverges linearly in time. Approaching the
critical point, the spreading velocity of the interface vanishes algebraically
with a DI critical exponent. Introducing a symmetry-breaking field $h$ that
prefers one absorbing state over the other drives the interface to move
asymmetrically toward the unpreferred absorbing region. In Monte Carlo
simulations, we find that the spreading velocity of this driven interface shows
a discontinuous jump at criticality. We explain that this unusual behavior is
due to a finite relaxation time in the absorbing phase. The crossover behavior
from the symmetric case (DI class) to the asymmetric case (directed percolation
class) is also studied. We find the scaling dimension of the symmetry-breaking

each of which corresponds to a system with different size. The weight of each
component of the mixture is controlled by a penalty term and systematically
tuned in a preliminary run in a way similar to the multicanonical algorithm. In
a measurement run, the system grows and shrinks without violating the detailed
balance condition and we can obtain the correct canonical averages if physical
quantities is measured only when its size is equal to the prescribed maximum
size. The mixing of Markov chain is facilitated by the fast relaxation at small

algorithms for natural language disambiguation tasks and observe that they can
be re-cast as learning linear separators in the feature space. Each of the
methods makes a priori assumptions, which it employs, given the data, when
searching for its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space
that is as rich as the space of all linear separators. We use this to build an
argument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear
separator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a
specific problem.
  We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators,
utilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety
of ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is
attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large
number of attributes.
  In particular, we present an extensive experimental comparison of our
approach with other methods on several well studied lexical disambiguation
tasks such as context-sensitive spelling correction, prepositional phrase
attachment and part of speech tagging. In all cases we show that our approach
either outperforms other methods tried for these tasks or performs comparably
to the best.

determination of the light hadron spectrum in the quenched approximation with
sufficient accuracy to expose statistically significant disagreements with the

5-10%$. The data are also accurate enough to show evidence for artifacts of
quenching predicted by chiral perturbation theory. I give an update on results
for light quark masses, the kaon B-parameter, and the decay constants and
B-parameters of heavy-light mesons. Most of these are known in the quenched
approximation to $\sim 10%$ accuracy or better, and preliminary estimates of
quenching errors are of comparable size. One exception is the light quark
masses, for which the quenching errors appear to be larger. I discuss the
computational requirements for simulations of QCD with all approximations
controlled, and argue that they will likely begin once computers sustain about
10 Teraflops. This is 30-40 times faster than present state-of-the-art

with a minimum lattice spacing of $\approx 0.1 $fm. I review results obtained
with improved discretizations and conclude that they satisfy this requirement
in most cases. Examples of successful improvement include the calculation of

diagonal GSO projection which excludes space-time fermions, and study the
D-branes into these theories. The low-energy dynamics of N coincident D-branes
is governed by a U(N) gauge theory coupled to adjoint scalar fields. It is
tempting to look for the type 0 string duals of such bosonic gauge theories in
the background of the R-R charged p-brane classical solutions. This results in
a picture analogous to the one recently proposed by Polyakov (hep-th/9809057).
One of the serious problems that needs to be resolved is the closed string
tachyon mode which couples to the D-branes and appears to cause an instability.
We study the tachyon terms in the type 0 effective action and argue that the
background R-R flux provides a positive shift of the (mass)^2 of the tachyon.
Thus, for sufficiently large flux, the tachyonic instability may be cured,
removing the most basic obstacle to constructing the type 0 duals of
non-supersymmetric gauge theories. We further find that the tachyon acquires an
expectation value in presence of the R-R flux. This effect is crucial for

description of the nonequilibrium dynamics of a symmetry-breaking phase
transition in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in an expanding universe. In contrast to a
naive expansion in powers of the coupling constant, this approximation scheme
provides for (a) a description of the nonequilibrium state in terms of its own
finite-width quasiparticle excitations, thus correctly incorporating
dissipative effects in low-order calculations, and (b) the emergence from a
symmetric initial state of a final state exhibiting the properties of
spontaneous symmetry breaking, while maintaining the constraint $<\phi>\equiv
0$. Earlier work on dissipative perturbation theory and spontaneous symmetry
breaking in Minkowski spacetime is reviewed. The central problem addressed is
the construction of a perturbative approximation scheme which treats the
initial symmetric state in terms of the field $\phi$, while the state that
emerges at later times is treated in terms of a field $\zeta$, linearly related
to $\phi^2$. The connection between early and late times involves an infinite
sequence of composite propagators. Explicit one-loop calculations are given of
the gap equations that determine quasiparticle masses and of the equation of
motion for $<\phi^2(t)>$ and the renormalization of these equations is
described. The perturbation series needed to describe the symmetric and
broken-symmetry states are not equivalent, and this leads to ambiguities
intrinsic to any perturbative approach. These ambiguities are discussed in
detail and a systematic procedure for matching the two approximations is
described.
