expanding bacterial colonies. Such sectors are spatially segregated
sub-populations of mutants. The sectors can be seen both in disk-shaped
colonies and in branching colonies. We study the sectors using two models we
have used in the past to study bacterial colonies -- a continuous
reaction-diffusion model with non-linear diffusion and a discrete
``Communicating Walkers'' model. We find that in expanding colonies, and
especially in branching colonies, segregation processes are more likely than in
a spatially static population. One such process is the establishment of stable
sub- population having neutral mutation. Another example is the maintenance of
wild-type population along side with sub-population of advantageous mutants.
Understanding such processes in bacterial colonies is an important subject by
itself, as well as a model system for similar processes in other spreading
populations.

widespread in the literature on gravitational theories alternative to general

the transformation to the Einstein frame is generated by a fundamental scalar
field already present in the theory. In this context, the problem of which
conformal frame is the physical one has to be dealt with and, in the general
case, it has been clarified only recently; the formulation of a theory in the
``new'' conformal frame leads to departures from canonical Einstein gravity. In
this article, we review the literature on conformal transformations in
classical gravitational theories and in cosmology, seen both as purely
mathematical tools and as maps with physically relevant aspects. It appears
particularly urgent to refer the analysis of experimental tests of Brans-Dicke

extend to gravity a previously found `dimension-shifting' relation between (the
