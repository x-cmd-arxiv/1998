temperature analysis reveals that even arbitrarily weak quenched disorder
(i.e., arbitrarily low aerogel density) destroys translational (smectic) order.
A harmonic approximation to the elastic energy suggests that there is no
``smectic Bragg glass'' phase in this system: even at zero temperature, it is
riddled with dislocation loops induced by the quenched disorder. This result
implies the destruction of orientational (nematic) order as well, and that the
thermodynamically sharp Nematic-Smectic-A transition is destroyed by disorder,
in agreement with recent experimental results. We also show that the anharmonic
elastic terms neglected in the above treatment are important (i.e., are
``relevant'' in the renormalization group sense); whether they alter the above
conclusions about the smectic Bragg glass, orientational disorder, and the
existence of sharp transitions, remains an open question. However, they do not
alter our conclusion that translational (smectic) order is always destroyed. In
contrast, we expect that weak annealed disorder should have no qualitative
effects on the smectic order.

topological defects during phase transitions is known as the Kibble mechanism.
A central component of the mechanism is the so-called ``geodesic rule''.
Although in the Abelian Higgs model the validity of the geodesic rule has been
questioned recently, it is known to be valid on energetic grounds for a global
U(1) symmetry breaking transition. However, even for these globally symmetric
models no dynamical analisys of the rule has been carried to this date, and
some points as to how events proceed still remain obscure. This paper tries to
clarify the dynamics of the geodesic rule in the context of a global U(1)
model. With an appropriate ansatz for the field modulus we find a family of
analytical expressions, phase walls, that accounts for both geodesic and
nongeodesic configurations. We then show how the latter ones are unstable and
decay into the former by nucleating pairs of defects. Finnally, we try to give
a physical perspective of how the geodesic rule might really work in these

complete here its spectral analysis: the conclusion is that the local

additive Fourier transform is closely related to the Tate-Gel'fand-Graev Gamma

to a number of principal problems of modern astronomy and time-keeping
metrology. The full exploration of pulsar properties requires obtaining
unbiased estimates of the spin and orbital parameters. These estimates depend
essentially on the random noise component being revealed in the residuals of
time of arrivals (TOA). In the present paper, the influence of low-frequency
(""red"") timing noise with spectral indices from 1 to 6 on TOA residuals,
variances, and covariances of estimates of measured parameters of single and
binary pulsars are studied. In order to determine their functional dependence
on time, an analytic technique of processing of observational data in time
domain is developed which takes into account both stationary and non-stationary
components of noise. Our analysis includes a simplified timing model of a
binary pulsar in a circular orbit and procedure of estimation of pulsar
parameters and residuals under the influence of red noise. We reconfirm that
uncorrelated white noise of errors of measurements of TOA brings on gradually
decreasing residuals, variances and covariances of all parameters. On the other
hand, we show that any red noise causes the residuals, variances, and
covariances of certain parameters to increase with time. Hence, the low
frequency noise corrupts our observations and reduces experimental
possibilities for better tests of General Relativity Theory. We also treat in
detail the influence of a polynomial drift of noise on the residuals and
fitting parameters. Results of the analitic analysis are used for discussion of
a statistic describing stabilities of kinematic and dynamic pulsar time scales.
