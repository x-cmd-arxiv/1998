the ejecta can be approximated fairly accurately as frequency-integrated (grey)
radiative transfer using a mean opacity as shown by Swartz, Sutherland, &
Harkness (SSH). In SSH's grey radiative transfer procedure (unoptimized) the
mean opacity is a pure absorption opacity and it is a constant aside from a
usually weak composition dependence. In this paper, we present a variation on
the SSH procedure which uses multiple mean opacities which have both absorption
and scattering components. There is a mean opacity for each order of Compton
scattering. A local-state (LS) approximation permits an analytic solution for
the gamma-ray transfer of scattered gamma-ray fields. The LS approximation is
admittedly crude, but the scattered fields are always of lesser importance to
the energy deposition. We call our procedure the LS grey radiative transfer
procedure or LS procedure for short. For a standard Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
model the uncertainty in gamma-ray energy deposition is estimated to be of
order 10 % or less. The LS procedure code used for this paper can be obtained
by request from the author.
  For completeness and easy reference, we include in this paper a review of the
gamma-ray opacities important in supernovae, a discussion of the appropriate
mean opacity prescription, and a discussion of the errors arising from
neglecting time-dependent and non-static radiative transfer effects.

physical properties of a LL system to date. By comparing the ionic column
densities for Fe^+, Fe^{++}, Si^+, and Si^{3+} against calculations derived
from the CLOUDY software package, we have strictly constrained the ionization
state of this system. This has enabled us to calculate accurate abundances of a
Lyman limit system for the first time at z > 2, e.g., [Fe/H] = -0.5 \pm 0.1. We
also derive a total hydrogen column density, log N(H) = 20.73 \pm 0.2, which is
comparable to values observed for the damped lya systems.
  The system is special for exhibiting CII* 1335 absorption, allowing an
estimate of the electron density, n_e = 6.5 \pm 1.3 x 10^{-2} cm^{-3}. Coupling
this measurement with our knowledge of the ionization state, we derive the
following physical properties: (1) hydrogen volume density, n_H = 5.9 \pm 1.2 x
10^{-2} cm^{-3}, (2) path length, l = 3 \pm 1.6 kpc, and (3) ionizing
intensity, log J_{912} = -20.22 \pm 0.21. We point out that a number of the
physical properties (e.g. [Fe/H], N(H), n_H) resemble those observed for the
damped lya systems, which suggests this system may be the photoionized analog
of a damped system. The techniques introduced in this Letter should be
applicable to a number of Lyman limit systems and therefore enable a survey of
their chemical abundances and other physical properties.

at present time are discussed. The first one is the possibility that we are
living at the beginning of a new inflation-like era. Then classical
cosmological tests, like the luminosity distance or the angular size of distant
objects as functions of redshift, as well as the behaviour of density
perturbations in a dustlike matter component including baryons as a function of
redshift, can provide information sufficient for the unambiguous determination
of an effective potential of a corresponding present inflaton scalar field. The
second, unrelated extension is a possibility of broken-scale-invariant
cosmological models which have localized steps or spikes in the primordial
perturbation spectrum. These features can be produced by fast phase transitions
in physical fields other than an inflaton field in the early Universe during
inflation and not far from the end of it. At present, it seems that the only
scale in the spectrum around which we might see something of this type is
$k=0.05 h Mpc^{-1}$.

these gamma-rays arise from the interactions of cosmic ray nuclei with ambient
matter. Cosmic Ray particles have been observed up to 3 10^20 eV, with many
arguments suggesting, that up to about 3 10^18 eV they are of Galactic origin.
Cosmic ray particles get injected by supernova explosions. Their injected
spectrum is steepened by diffusive losses from the Galaxy to yield the observed
spectrum. As cosmic ray particles roam around in the Galactic disk, they
encounter molecular clouds and through p-p collisions produce gamma rays from
pion decay. The flux and spectrum of these gamma rays is then a clear signature
of cosmic rays throughout the Galaxy. Star formation activity peaks in the
central region of the Galaxy, around the Galactic Center. Looking then at the
gamma ray spectrum of the central region of our Galaxy yields clues as to where
the cosmic ray particles interact, and with what spectrum. Using the FLUKA
Monte-Carlo, we have modelled this spectrum, and find a best fit for a powerlaw
spectral index of 2.34, rather close to the suggested injection spectrum for
supernovae which explode into their own winds. This suggests that most cosmic
ray interaction happens near the sources of injection; this is consistent with
the spectrum of cosmic ray nuclei derived from spallation. One consequence is
that cosmic ray heating and ionization should be strong in the Galactic Center
region.

the energy constraint and the momentum constraint. Previous results are
extended to encompass the imposition of an arbitrary initial hypersurface. A
Lagrange multiplier in the generating functional restricts the initial fields,

stress-energy tensors characteristic to normal perfect fluids. It is shown that
they naturally describe both non-rotating ($r=2$) and rotating (then a
combination of $r=2$ and $r=3$ fields is indispensable) general relativistic
perfect fluids possessing every type of equations of state. Meanwile, a free
$r=3$ field is completely equivalent to appearance of the cosmological term in
Einstein's equations. Sound waves represent perturbations propagating on the
background of the $r=2$ field. Some exotic properties of these two fields are
outlined.

been achieved for other quarks. Measurements of the top production and decay

flavor changing neutral current decay b->s gamma and find good agreement with
the Standard Model. Measurements of b-quark production cross sections in ppbar
collisions by CDF and D0 and in ep collisions by H1 continue to show
discrepancies between theory and experiment. CDF and DELPHI have measured the
b-quark fragmentation fractions with better accuracy than previous

Langer's theory of homogeneous nucleation is applicable as long as the
expansion around the semiclassical saddle point associated with tunnelling is
convergent. This expansion breaks down when the exponential suppression of the
rate by the saddle-point action becomes comparable to the pre-exponential
factor associated with fluctuations around the saddle point. We reconfirm that

asymptotic domains of the moduli space into regions which can/cannot be mapped
to Type II string theory or 11D Supergravity (SUGRA) with large radii. We call
these the safe and unsafe domains. The safe domain is the interior of the
future light cone in the moduli space while the unsafe domain contains the
spacelike region and the past light cone. Within the safe domain, apparent
cosmological singularities can be resolved by duality transformations and we
briefly provide a physical picture of how this occurs. The unsafe domains
represent true singularities where all field theoretic description of the
physics breaks down. They violate the holographic principle. We argue that this

distinct phases -- electric confinement, Coulomb and oblique confinement --
separated by two separate transition regions. For larger scalar masses, the

inadequate because of two major problems: First, the higher-derivative
