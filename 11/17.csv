constrained. The obtained data set is the first one to contain all important
cooling lines of a cool PDR, and allows a comparison to be made with classical
PDRs. To this effect one- and three-dimensional PDR models are presented which
incorporate the physical characteristics of the source, and are aimed at
understanding the dominant heating processes of the cloud. The contribution of
very small grains to the photo-electric heating rate is estimated from these

Observations of the pure rotational H_2 lines with ISO, in particular the S(3)

K, molecular gas. This gas cannot be accommodated by the presented models.

gas is in thermal equilibrium with a hot halo, then it is also likely that D<30
kpc, putting the HVC in the Galactic Halo, as was the case for HVC complex~A
(for which z=2.5--7 kpc). We find that, on this sightline, H+ represents
23pm10% of the hydrogen in the HVC. The total gaseous mass is 2x10^6 (D/5
kpc)^2 Msun and, depending on whether the space velocity is completely radial
or vertical, the HVC represents a downward mass flux of ~0.036-0.083 (D/5 kpc)

were originally enriched by Type II supernovae. However, iron and silicon
abundances in the intracluster gas within rich clusters suggest enrichment by a
larger number of supernovae per unit optical light than we require for massive
ellipticals, either more Type Ia or more Type II from a flatter IMF. Since the
enrichment histories of massive ellipticals and rich clusters are fundamentally
different, E and SO galaxies may not be the only sources of metal enrichment in
rich cluster gas.

possibility of self-enrichment of the accreted hydrogen-rich atmosphere with

self-enrichment proceeds too slowly if the accreted gas has near-solar

not find a fast nova outburst. This conclusion remains valid if the initial
metallicity of the accreted gas is raised by a factor of five. Therefore we

protons may be accelerated to such energies, their ejection into the

accompanied by considerable adiabatic losses in the expanding shell. The
problem is circumvented by neutrons produced in photohadronic interactions,
which are not magnetically bound and thus effectively ejected in the moment of
their production. They can be both produced in sufficient number and be able to
leave the emission region if the optical depth of the emission region to
photohadronic interactions is of order 1. We show that this requirement can be
fulfilled under the same conditions which allow acceleration of protons to the

homeotropic orientation at the surface of the particle. Three structures are
possible: a dipole, a Saturn-ring, and a surface-ring configuration, which we
investigate by numerically minimizing the Frank free energy supplemented by a
magnetic-field and a surface term. In the dipole configuration, which is the
absolutely stable structure for micron-size particles and sufficiently strong
surface anchoring, a twist transition is found and analyzed. We show that a
transition from the dipole to the Saturn ring configuration is induced by
either decreasing the particle size or by applying a magnetic field. The effect
of metastability and the occurence of hysteresis in connection with a magnetic
field are discussed. The surface-ring configuration appears when the
surface-anchoring strength W is reduced. It is also favored by a large
saddle-splay constant K_24. A comparison with recent experiments by Poulin et
al. gives a lower bound for W, i.e., W > 0.6 erg/cm^2 for the interface of
water and pentylcyanobiphenyl (5CB) in the presence of the surfactant sodium
dodecyl sulfate.

usual ultraviolet desert between $\sim 10^{3} - 10^{19}$ GeV where effective
field theory ideas apply. Consequently, the success of the desert in explaining
approximate symmetries is lost, and theories of flavor, neutrino masses, proton
longevity or supersymmetry breaking, lose their usual habitat. In this paper we
show that these ideas can find a new home in an infrared desert: the large
space in the extra dimensions. The main idea is that symmetries are
primordially exact on our brane, but are broken at O(1) on distant branes. This
breaking is communicated to us in a distance-suppressed way by bulk messengers.
We illustrate these ideas in a number of settings: 1) We construct theories for
the fermion mass hierarchy which avoid large FCNC's. 2) We re-iterate that
proton stability can arise if baryon number is gauged in the bulk. 3) We study
experimental constraints on light gauge fields and scalars in the bulk. 4) We
remark that the same ideas can be used to explain small neutrino masses, and
hierarchical supersymmetry breaking. 5) We construct a theory with bulk
technicolor, avoiding the difficulties with extended technicolor. There are
also interesting experimental signals of these ideas: 1) Attractive or
repulsive, isotope dependent sub-millimeter forces $\sim 10^6$ times
gravitational strength, from the exchange of light bulk particles. 2) Novel
Higgs decays to light generation fermions plus bulk scalars. 3) Collider
production of bulk vector and scalar fields, leading to large $\gamma$ or jet+

inelastic scattering can neither be reproduced by models which are based on
leading order $\alpha_s$ QCD matrix elements and parton showers nor by
next-to-leading order calculations. The measurement of forward jet cross
sections has been suggested as a promising probe of new small $\xbj$ parton
dynamics and the question is whether these data provide an indication of this.
The same question arises for other experimental data in deep inelastic
scattering at small $\xbj$ which can not be described by conventional models
for deep inelastic scattering. In this paper the influence of resolved photon
processes has been investigated and it has been studied to what extent the
inclusion of such processes in addition to normal deep inelastic scattering
leads to agreement with data. It is shown that two DGLAP evolution chains from
the hard scattering process towards the proton and the photon, respectively,
are sufficient to describe effects, observed in the HERA data, which have been
attributed to BFKL dynamics.

dynamics in the space $W_G$ of (action, angle) type collective variables. It is
shown that the transformed perturbation theory contributions are accumulated on
the boundary $\pa W_G$, i.e. are sensible to the $topology$ of factor space
$W_G$ and,therefore, to the theory symmetry group $G$. The abilities of our
perturbation theory are illustrated by examples from quantum mechanics and
field theory. Considering the Coulomb potential $1/|x|$ the total reduction of
quantum degrees of freedom is demonstrated mapping the dynamics in the (angle,
angular momentum, Runge-Lentz vector) space. To solve the (1+1)-dimensional
sin-Gordon model the theory is considered in the space (coordinates, momenta)
of solitons. It is shown the total reduction of quantum degrees of freedom and,
in result, there is not multiple production of particles. This result we

inversion for spin one projectiles with non-diagonal $S^j_{ll'}$ yielding a
$T_{\rm R}$ interaction. The method is a generalization of the
iterative-perturbative, IP, method. We present a test case indicating the
degree of uniqueness of the potential. The method is adapted, using established
procedures, into direct observable to potential inversion, fitting $\sigma$,
${\rm i}T_{11}$, $T_{20}$, $T_{21}$ and $T_{22}$ for d + alpha scattering over
a range of energies near 10 MeV. The $T_{\rm R}$ interaction which we find is
very different from that proposed elsewhere, both real and imaginary parts
being very different for odd and even parity channels.

shown that the structure of the deuteron momentum spectra for a neutron beam
momentum of 1.46 GeV can be explained as a consequence of the interplay of two
mechanisms involving the excitation of the N^*(1440) resonance and its
subsequent decay into N (pi pi)^{T=0}_{S-wave} and Delta pi respectively. The
relevance of the present analysis for the study of the Roper excitation and
decay properties, as well as for the interpretation of other two-pion
production experiments is discussed.

here ascribed to their non-mechanistic character, which becomes evident by
joining the notions of entanglement and quantum measurement. Measurement
analogically sets a (partial) constraint on the output of the computation of a
hard-to-reverse function. This constraint goes back in time along the
reversible computation process, computing the reverse function, which yields
quantum efficiency. The evolution, comprising wave function collapse (here a
revamped notion), is non-mechanistic as it is driven by both an initial
condition and a final constraint. It seems that the more the output is
constrained by measurement, the higher can be the efficiency. Setting a
complete constraint, by means of a special Zeno effect, yields (speculatively)
NP-complete=P.
