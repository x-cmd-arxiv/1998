determine the properties of the ionized, gaseous haloes of star-forming
galaxies. I first examine the ionization state of the halo, and conclude that
diluted radiation from massive stars, along with a possible secondary heating
source such as shocks, appears sufficient to explain the observations. I then
look at how single superbubbles evolve, as they must provide one of the main
mechanisms for transfer of mass and energy to the halo, as well as opening up
lines of sight for ionizing radiation to escape from the disk. Finally, I look
at the interactions of superbubbles, as they will rarely evolve in isolation,
and describe recent hydrodynamical and MHD simulations of the interstellar
medium shaped by multiple superbubbles.

plane of the Galaxy are interacting with the Reynolds' layer, the warm ionized
gas extending well above (H~910 pc) the Galactic plane (Reynolds 1993).
Characterizing the interaction between these clouds and their surroundings
should be useful in understanding one source of interstellar turbulence:
vertical shear flows. This paper discusses how studies of the morphology and
drag coefficient of falling clouds might be used to constrain the Reynolds
number for the flow, and hence the effective viscosity of the warm ionized
medium. If arguments based on morphology are correct, the effective viscosity
of the warm ionized medium is significantly higher than the classical values.
Possible resolutions to this problem are suggested.

report gives a review of the physics and astrophysics associated with the
questions of origin and propagation of these Extremely High Energy (EHE) cosmic
rays in the Universe. After a brief review of the observed cosmic rays in
general and their possible sources and acceleration mechanisms, a detailed
discussion is given of possible ""top-down"" (non-acceleration) scenarios of
origin of EHE cosmic rays through decay of sufficiently massive particles
originating from processes in the early Universe. The massive particles can
come from collapse and/or annihilation of cosmic topological defects (such as
monopoles, cosmic strings, etc.) associated with Grand Unified Theories or they
could be some long-lived metastable supermassive relic particles that were
created in the early Universe and are decaying in the current epoch. The
highest energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum can thus be used as a probe of
new fundamental physics beyond Standard Model. We discuss the role of existing
and proposed cosmic ray, gamma-ray and neutrino experiments in this context. We
also discuss how observations with next generation experiments of images and
spectra of EHE cosmic ray sources can be used to obtain new information on
Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields and possibly their origin.

equilibrium distribution functions for MOND disk models having a smoothly
truncated, exponential surface-density profiles and a constant Toomre $Q$

more stable in MOND than in Newtonian dynamics. As regards global instability
to bar formation, we find that as the mean acceleration in the disk is lowered,
the stability of the disk is increased as we cross from the Newtonian to the
MOND regime. The degree of stability levels off deep in the MOND regime, as
expected from scaling laws in MOND. For the disk model we use, this maximum
degree of stability is similar to the one imparted to a Newtonian disk by a
halo three times as massive at five disk scale lengths.

March 1996 with ASCA, EGRET, Whipple, and optical telescopes. In the X-ray
band, a spectral break was observed around 2 keV. We report here for the first
time the detection of high-energy gamma-ray flux from Mrk 501 with EGRET with
3.5 sigma significance (E>100 MeV). Higher flux was also observed in April/May
1996, with 4.0 sigma significance for E>100 MeV, and 5.2 sigma significance for
E>500 MeV. The gamma-ray spectrum was measured to be flatter than most of the
gamma-ray blazars. We find that the multiband spectrum in 1996 is consistent
with that calculated from a one-zone SSC model in a homogeneous region. In the
context of this model, we investigate the values of the magnetic field strength
and the beaming factor allowed by the observational results. We compare the
March 1996 multiwavelength spectrum with that in the flare state in April 1997.
Between these two epochs, the TeV flux increase is well correlated with that
observed in keV range. The keV and TeV amplitudes during the April 1997 flare
are accurately reproduced, assuming that the population of synchrotron photons
in 1996 are scattered by the newly injected relativistic electrons, having
maximum energies of G_max = 6.0e6. However, the TeV spectrum observed during
March 1996 campaign is flatter than predicted by our models. We find that this
cannot be explained by either higher order Comptonization or the contribution
of the `seed' IR photons from the host galaxy for the first-order external
radiation Comptonization.

of quasars, has been stimulated by statistical studies of quasar light curves

evidence, and discuss the significance of the recent detection of a planetary
mass microlensing event in the Galaxy by the MACHO group. We also look in more
detail at the light curves themselves, and make the case that many show the
characteristic morphology of caustic crossing events associated with a large
optical depth of lenses. This supports the idea that a large fraction of the
critical density is in the form of planetary mass compact bodies. The nature of
such bodies is discussed, and it is argued that current work on the QCD phase
transition suggests they are primordial black holes, although it is just
possible that they are compact gas clouds.

flow. The model has two inviscid invariants governing the dynamical behavior.
Depending on the choice of interaction coefficients, or coupling parameters,
the two invariants are either both positive definite, analogous to energy and
enstrophy of 2D flow, or only one is positive definite and the other not,
analogous to energy and helicity of 3D flow. In the 2D like model the dynamics
depend on the spectral ratio of enstrophy to energy. That ratio depends on
wave-number as $k^{\alpha}$. The enstrophy transfer through the inertial
sub-range can be described as a forward cascade for $\alpha < 2$ and a
diffusion in a statistical equilibrium for $\alpha > 2$. The $\alpha =2$ case,
corresponding to 2D turbulence, is a borderline between the two descriptions.
The difference can be understood in terms of the ratio of typical timescales in
the inertial sub-range and in the viscous sub-range. The multi fractality of
the enstrophy dissipation also depends on the parameter $\alpha$, and seems to
be related to the ratio of typical timescales of the different shell

  and the commensurability group actions","latex2e, 40 pages",,,"TIFR Bombay, School of Math. preprint, October 1998","math.AG math.CV",,"  To any compact hyperbolic Riemann surface $X$, we associate a new type of
automorphism group -- called its *commensurability automorphism group*,
$ComAut(X)$. The members of $ComAut(X)$ arise from closed circuits, starting
and ending at $X$, where the edges represent holomorphic covering maps amongst
compact connected Riemann surfaces (and the vertices represent the covering
surfaces). This group turns out to be the isotropy subgroup, at the point
represented by $X$ (in $T_{\infty}$), for the action of the universal
commensurability modular group on the universal direct limit of Teichm\""uller
spaces, $T_{\infty}$.
  Now, each point of $T_{\infty}$ represents a complex structure on the
universal hyperbolic solenoid. We notice that $ComAut(X)$ acts by holomorphic
automorphisms on that complex solenoid. Interestingly, this action turns out to
be ergodic (with respect to the natural measure on the solenoid) if and only if
the Fuchsian group uniformizing $X$ is *arithmetic*. Furthermore, the action of
the commensurability modular group, and of its isotropy subgroups, on some
natural vector bundles over $T_{\infty}$, are studied by us.

cross section of the reactions $pp\to pp \pi^0$, $pp\to pp \eta$ and $pp\to
p\Lambda K^+$ at threshold. Applying standard nonrelativistic perturbation
theory within the framework of meson exchange models (MEC) to all of the
investigated processes we observe that theory is still far--off from a
quantitative understanding of the existing data, although the qualitative
behaviour of the threshold cross sections can be reproduced. The often quoted
$\eta^2$--dependence of the $pp\to pp \pi^0$ cross section at threshold is due
to a calculational mistake of Koltun and Reitan (1966) and not based on
theoretical grounds, where threebody phasespace behaviour would yield $\eta^4$,
which can be affected by final state and short range effects. To respect the
high momentum transfers for $pp\to pp \eta$ and $pp\to p\Lambda K^+$
relativistic models were developed. Hereby the $\eta$--production still is
based on MEC, while the $K^+$ production was investigated in the
quark-gluon-picture based on the Bethe--Salpeter formalism.

of neuronal spike trains driven by external stimuli. The goal of our method is
to test the predictions of simple spike-generating models against
extracellularly recorded neuronal responses. Through a new statistic called the
power ratio, we distinguish between two broad classes of responses: (1)
responses that can be completely characterized by a variable firing rate, (for
example, modulated Poisson and gamma spike trains); and (2) responses for which
firing rate variations alone are not sufficient to characterize response
dynamics (for example, leaky integrate-and-fire spike trains as well as Poisson
spike trains with long absolute refractory periods). We show that the responses
of many visual neurons in the cat retinal ganglion, cat lateral geniculate
nucleus, and macaque primary visual cortex fall into the second class, which
implies that the pattern of spike times can carry significant information about
visual stimuli. Our results also suggest that spike trains of X-type retinal
ganglion cells, in particular, are very similar to spike trains generated by a
leaky integrate-and-fire model with additive, stimulus-independent noise that
could represent background synaptic activity.

is generated through conditional dynamics, using quantum jump methods,
including both cavity damping and spontaneous emission decay, and evaluate the
fidelity and relative entropy of entanglement of the generated state compared
with the target entangled state.
