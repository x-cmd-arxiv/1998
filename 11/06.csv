discovered in earlier Arecibo studies of the system. The HI masses of the three
concentrations do not appear to be sufficient for them to be self-gravitating;
however, their HImasses and dynamical masses are very similar to those of faint
Im galaxies in the Virgo cluster. The peak HI column density of each of the
clouds is close to the star formation threshold, but CCD images in B and R
reveal no trace of stars nor star formation. If the system is gravitationally
bound and in Virial equilibrium, we find its total mass to be ten times that
within the outermost HI contours of the individual galaxies and clouds.
Thirty-seven percent of the total HI lies outside the boundaries of the
individual galaxies as determined by the VLA mapping; 28% cannot be ascribed to
either galaxy nor to the discrete concentrations. One possible way to account
for the velocity field and the large quantity of diffuse gas is to assume that
DDO 137, the gas concentrations and other apparent tidal features are due to
gas infall into clumps within the dark matter potential of the group, and that
prior to the interaction the group consisted of an irregular galaxy (NGC 4532)
and a large, star-poor HI cloud like HI 1225+01 (Giovanelli et al. 1991).

function of redshift, using simple assumptions about the metal and dust
enrichment of the gas and the distribution of dust in galaxies. We use an
iterative procedure to reconstruct the intrinsic Star Formation Rate (SFR)
density of galaxies with redshift, by applying dust obscuration corrections to
the observed UV emission. The iterative procedure converges to multiple
solutions for the intrinsic SFR density, divided into two basic classes. The
first class of solutions predicts relatively large UV attenuation at high
redshift, with A(1500 A)=1.9 mag at z~3, and smaller attenuations at z<1, with
A(2800 A)=1.25 mag. The SFR density of this set of solutions is constant for
z>~1.2 and declines for z<1.2; it resembles in shape the ``monolithic
collapse'' scenario for star formation. The second class of solutions predicts
relatively low UV attenuations at high redshift, with A(1500 A)=0.75 mag at
z~3, and larger attenuations at z<1, with A(2800 A)=1.50 mag. The SFR density
in this case has a peak at z~1.2. The advantages and shortcomings of both
classes are analyzed in the light of available observational constraints,
including the opacity of galaxies at 0<z<1 and the intensity and spectral
energy distribution of the cosmic infrared background from the COBE DIRBE and
FIRAS data. We conclude that both classes of models are acceptable within the
current uncertainties, but the ``monolithic collapse'' class matches the
available observations better than the other one. We also investigate the
dependence of our solutions on the different model assumptions.

reasonably unified as a function of relative surface brightness, by using a new

consistent with the fundamentally morphological definition of the DIM as being
`Diffuse', compared to the traditional way adopted in previous studies that
could only isolate the DIM based on an absolute surface brightness criterion.
Our results suggest that the variation of the DIM's significance among the
galaxies is small enough so that the fractional contribution of the DIM to the
global H$\alpha$ luminosity in the galaxies is fairly constant, as has been
observed. We found a smooth structural transition from HII regions to the DIM,
suggesting that the ionizing energy for the DIM mainly comes from HII regions.

Cancer, A1367, Coma and Virgo. With the aim of discussing possible
environmental dependences of the radio properties, we compare these results
with those obtained for relatively isolated objects in the Coma supercluster.
We find that the RLF of Cancer, A262 and Virgo are consistent with that of
isolated galaxies. Conversely we confirm earlier claims that galaxies in A1367
and Coma have their radio emissivity enhanced by a factor of 5 with respect to
isolated objects. We discuss this result in the framework of the dynamical
pressure suffered by galaxies in motion through the intra-cluster gas
(ram-pressure). We find that the radio excess is statistically larger for
galaxies in fast transit motion. This is coherent with the idea that enhanced
radio continuum activity is associated with magnetic field compression. The
X-ray luminosities and temperatures of Coma and A1367 imply that these two
clusters have significantly larger intracluster gas density than the remaining
three studied ones, providing a clue for explaining the higher radio continuum
luminosities of their galaxies. Multiple systems in the Coma supercluster

continuum and iron K\alpha fluorescent line near 6.5 keV produced by X-ray
illumination of the accretion disc. This gives a powerful diagnostic of the
accretion geometry, with the amplitude of the reprocessed components showing
the solid angle subtended by the disc, while the detailed shape of the
relativistic smearing shows how close this material is to the black hole event
horizon.
  We find that reflection is always significantly present in the spectra, but
that its fractional contribution decreases as the decline progresses. The
amount of relativistic smearing is also consistent with decreasing during the
decline, although this is poorly constrained except for the brightest spectra.
One plausible scenario explaining this evolution is of an optically thick disc
with inner radius increasing as a function of time, with the X-ray source in
the form of a central corona. This is similar to the evolution inferred for
other X-ray transient sources, such as Nova Muscae, except that the underlying
power law spectrum of GS 2023+338 stayed constant as the disc geometry changed.

Here, this extended KJMA theory is applied to a kinetic Ising lattice-gas
model, in which the elementary kinetic processes act on microscopic length and
time scales. The theoretical framework is used to analyze data from extensive
Monte Carlo simulations. The theory is inherently a mesoscopic continuum
picture, and in principle it requires a large separation between the
microscopic scales and the mesoscopic scales characteristic of the evolving
two-phase structure. Nevertheless, we find excellent quantitative agreement
with the simulations in a large parameter regime, extending remarkably far
towards strong fields (large supersaturations) and correspondingly small
nucleation barriers. The original KJMA theory permits direct measurement of the
order parameter in the metastable phase, and using the extension to correlation
functions one can also perform separate measurements of the nucleation rate and
the average velocity of the convoluted interface between the metastable and
stable phase regions. The values obtained for all three quantities are verified

difficult to measure directly during a process of phase transformation, data

nanometre-scale devices with mechanical and electrical properties that are
qualitatively different from those at larger dimensions. The investigation of
these properties, and particularly the increasing influence of quantum effects
on electron transport, has therefore attracted much interest. Quantum
properties of the conductance can be observed when `breaking' a metallic
contact: as two metal electrodes in contact with each other are slowly
retracted, the contact area undergoes structural rearrangements until it
consists in its final stages of only a few bridging atoms. Just before the
abrubt transition to tunneling occurs, the electrical conductance through a
monovalent metal contact is always close to a value of 2e^2/h, where e is the
charge on an electron and h is Plack's constant. This value corresponds to one
quantum unit of conductance, thus indicating that the `neck' of the contact
consists of a single atom. In contrast to previous observations of only
single-atom necks, here we describe the breaking of atomic-scale gold contacts,
which leads to the formation of gold chains one atom thick and at least four
atoms long. Once we start to pull out a chain, the conductance never exceeds
2e^2/h, confirming that it acts as a one-dimensional quantized nanowire. Given
their high stability and the ability to support ballistic electron transport,
these structures seem well suited for the investigation of atomic-scale
electronics.

and the mass of the charged Higgs boson is found to be of little importance.

branching ratios of Z->h(A)+gamma of the order 10^{-5} for masses larger than
20 GeV, but approach 10^{-6} for low masses. Relating the expectation to the

the phases in the Lagrangian are O(1). We derive a constraint on the phases in
the so-called $\mu$- and $B_\mu$-parameters and gaugino masses. Then, we
discuss a model in which the CP violating phase can be adequately suppressed.
If the $\mu$- and $B_\mu$-parameters originate from the same superpotential

However, in this class of models, the ratio $B_\mu/\mu$ becomes too large, and

potassium, calcium, and sodium. Likewise the shapes of the simulated action
potential and five membrane currents are in good agreement with experiments. We
do not see any drift in the values of the concentrations in a long time
simulation, and we obtain the same asymptotic values when starting from the
full equilibrium situation with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic
concentrations.

The light refraction emerges directly that time is four-dimensional to us
perfectly. It translates some thing incomprehensible into easily comprehensible
in natural science, and translates some problems complex into easy. It would
take a great transformation in physics. My paper is a seminal result, from it
was published in Potential Science in 1982, there is no one to oppose, and some
one have new discoveries based on my theory.

counting rate, we constructed an LED pulsed light source and its output monitor
system. For the monitor system, we employed a photon counting method using a
photomultiplier as a monitor photon detector. It is found that the method
offers a simple way to monitor outputs from a pulsed light source and that,
together with an LED light source, it provides a handy way to investigate
photomultiplier's rate effects.

improve the sensitivity of thermal noise measurements: intra-cavity intensity
stabilisation. It is demonstrated that electro-optic feedback can be used to
reduce intra-cavity intensity fluctuations, and the consequent radiation
pressure fluctuations, by a factor of two below the quantum noise limit. We
show that this is achievable in the presence of large classical intensity
fluctuations on the incident laser beam. The benefits of this scheme are a
consequence of the sub-Poissonian intensity statistics of the field inside a
feedback loop, and the quantum non-demolition nature of radiation pressure
noise as a readout system for the intra-cavity intensity fluctuations.

the phase detection system. Experimental results obtained using a Nd:YAG laser
show a signal gain of 10dB and a signal transfer ratio of T_s=0.9. This result
easily exceeds the standard quantum limit for signal transfer. The results also
explicitly demonstrate the phase sensitive nature of the amplification process.
