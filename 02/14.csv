  complex","accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a combined X-ray and optical analysis of the ABCG 85/87/89 complex
of clusters of galaxies, based on the ROSAT PSPC image, optical photometric
catalogues (Slezak et al. 1998), and an optical redshift catalogue (Durret et
al. 1998). From this combined data set, we find striking alignments at all
scales at PA$\simeq$160\deg. At small scales, the cD galaxy in ABCG 85 and the
brightest galaxies in the cluster are aligned along this PA. At a larger scale,
X-ray emission defines a comparable PA south-southeast of ABCG 85 towards ABCG
87, with a patchy X-ray structure very different from the regular shape of the
optical galaxy distribution in ABCG 87. The galaxy velocities in the ABCG 87
region show the existence of subgroups, which all have an X-ray counterpart,
and seem to be falling onto ABCG 85 along a filament almost perpendicular to
the plane of the sky. To the west of ABCG 85, ABCG 89 appears as a significant
galaxy density enhancement, but is barely detected at X-ray wavelengths. The
galaxy velocities reveal that in fact this is not a cluster but two groups with
very different velocities superimposed along the line of sight. These two
groups appear to be located in intersecting sheets on opposite sides of a large
bubble. These data and their interpretation reinforce the cosmological scenario
in which matter, including galaxies, groups and gas, falls onto the cluster
along a filament.

to a new equilibrium after each merging episode; conditions of shock, or of
closely adiabatic compression at the boundary with the external gas, preheated
by stellar energy feedbacks. We predict the L-T relation, consistent with the

provided by the hierarchical clustering for different COBE-normalized CDM
models, to predict the z-resolved luminosity functions, the source counts, the
redshift distributions and contribution of the unresolved groups and clusters
to the soft X-ray background. When compared with the recent ROSAT surveys, our
results confirm that the critical cosmology with Standard CDM is ruled out by
its overproduction of local clusters. On account of underproduction, instead,
we rule out open cosmologies except for a narrow range around \Omega_o=0.5;
even there, we find the consistency with the full data base to be hardly
marginal. For \Omega_o=0.3 in flat geometry, we obtain acceptable fits. For the
tilted CDM perturbation spectrum with high baryonic content in the critical
universe, we obtain marginal consistency. Finally, we discuss the effective
limitations of X-ray clusters and groups as cosmological signposts, and their
brighter prospects toward the astrophysics of the ICP and the cosmogony of
large, high-contrast structures.

from $0.05 M_*$ to $1.0 M_*$ and in initial minimum Toomre $Q$ value from 1.1

fashion, but similarities exist in their predictions, including spiral arm
pattern speeds and morphological features. Our results represent limiting cases
(i.e. systems evolved isothermally) rather than true physical systems. Disks
become active from the inner regions outward. From the earliest times, their
evolution is a strongly dynamic process rather than a smooth progression toward
eventual nonlinear behavior. We calculate approximate growth rates for the
spiral patterns; the one-armed ($m=1$) spiral arm is not the fastest growing
pattern of most disks. In our SPH simulations, disks with initial minimum
$Q=1.5$ or lower break up into proto-binary or proto-planetary clumps. However,
these simulations cannot follow the physics important for the flow and must be
terminated before the system has completely evolved. At their termination, PPM
simulations with similar initial conditions show uneven mass distributions
within spiral arms, suggesting that clumping behavior might result if they were
carried further. Concern that the point-like nature of SPH exaggerates
clumping, that our representation of the gravitational potential in PPM is too
coarse, and that our physics assumptions are too simple, suggest caution in

the hypotheses that pulsar ``death'' corresponds to cessation of pair creation
over the magnetic poles and that the magnetic field has a locally dipolar
topology. While the frame dragging effect in star centered dipole geometry does
improve comparison of the theory with observation, an unacceptably large
fraction of the observed stars outside the bounds of pair creation theory still
persists. Offsetting the dipole improves the correspondence between theory and
observation. The result is a ``death valley'' for pulsars; acceptable
comparison of observation and theory occurs if the boundary of death valley
corresponds to offsets of the dipole center from the stellar center $\sim
(0.7-0.8) R_*$. I also point out that pulsars are absent for magnetic moments
corresponding to star centered polar fields in excess of $\sim 4 \times

undergo moderate to strong kinematical evolution the WD mass fraction is

inconsistent with causally connected variations in a single, symmetric,
relativistic shell interacting with the ambient material (""external shocks"").
Rather, the symmetry of the shell must be broken on an angular scale much
smaller than Gamma^{-1} where Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor for the shell.
The observed variability in the external shock models arises from the number of
causally connected regions that (randomly) become active. We define the
""surface filling factor"" to be the ratio of the area of causally connected
regions that become active to the observable area of the shell. From the
observed variability in 52 BATSE bursts, we estimate the surface filling factor
to be typically 0.005 although some values are near unity. We find that the
surface filling factor is about 0.1 Delta T/T in both the constant Gamma phase
(which probably produces the GRB) and the deaccelerating phase (which probably
produces the x-ray afterglows). Here, \Delta T is a typical time scale of
variability and T is the time since the initial signal. We analyze the 2 hr
flare seen by ASCA 36 hr after the GRB and conclude that the surface filling
factor must be small (0.001) in the x-ray afterglow phase as well. Explanations
for low surface filling factor can either require more or less energy (by a
factor of about 1000) compared to that expected for a symmetric shell.

much more abundant hadronic component of cosmic rays. We have carried out here
such systematic simulation studies using CORSIKA package in order to understand
the Cerenkov photon density fluctuations for 5 different energies at various
core distances both for gamma ray and proton primaries incident vertically at
the top of the atmosphere. Such a systematic comparison of shower to shower
density fluctuations for gamma ray and proton primaries is carried out for the
first time here. It is found that the density fluctuations are significantly
non-Poissonian. Such fluctuations are much more pronounced in the proton
primaries than gamma ray primaries at all energies. The processes that
contribute significantly to the observed fluctuations have been identified. It
has been found that significant contribution to fluctuations comes from photons
emitted after shower maximum. The electron number fluctuations and correlated
emission of Cerenkov photons are mainly responsible for the observed
fluctuations.

  We have modelled these anomalous scattering effects in terms of

  It is shown that the those primary states in CFT which have non-unitary
descendants correspond in the 3d theory to supercritical charges and cause
vacuum instability. It is also shown that logarithmic operators separating the
unitary sector from a non-unitary one correspond to an exact zero energy ground
state in which case the 3d Hamiltonian naturally has a Jordan structure.

theory. However, the effective low energy D=4, N=1 field theory lagrangian does
not yield in general finite theories. In this note we present the first (to our
knowledge) such an example. It may be constructed in three dual ways: i) as a
$Z_3$, SO(32) heterotic orbifold; ii) as a Type -IIB, $Z_3$ orientifold with
only ninebranes and a Wilson line or iii) as a Type-IIB, $Z_6$ orientifold with
only fivebranes. The gauge group is $SU(4)^3$ with three chiral generations.
Although chiral, a subsector of the model is continuosly connected to a model
with global N=4 supersymmetry. From the $Z_6$, Type IIB orientifold point of
view the above connection may be understood as a transition of four dynamical
fivebranes from a fixed point to the bulk. The N=1 model is thus also expected
to be S-dual. We also remark that, using the untwisted dilaton and moduli
fields of these constructions as spurion fields, yields soft SUSY-breaking
terms which preserve finiteness even for N=0.

  Anal",,,,"math.OA",,"  Pimsner introduced the C*-algebra O_X generated by a Hilbert bimodule X over
a C*-algebra A. We look for additional conditions that X should satisfy in
order to study simplicity and, more generally, the ideal structure of O_X when
X is finite projective. We introduce two conditions: `(I)-freeness' and
`(II)-freeness', stronger than the former, in analogy with [J. Cuntz, W.
Krieger, Invent. Math. 56, 251-268] and [J. Cuntz, Invent. Math. 63, 25-40]
respectively. (I)-freeness comprehend the case of the bimodules associated with
an inclusion of simple C*-algebras with finite index, real or pseudoreal
bimodules with finite dimension and the case of `Cuntz-Krieger bimodules'. If X
satisfies this condition the C*-algebra O_X does not depend on the choice of
the generators when A is faithfully represented. As a consequence, if X is
(I)-free and A is X-simple, then O_X is simple. In the case of Cuntz-Krieger
algebras, X-simplicity corresponds to irreducibility of the defining matrix. If
A is simple and p.i. then O_X is p.i., if A is nonnuclear then O_X is
nonnuclear. We therefore provide examples of (purely) infinite nonnuclear
simple C*-algebras. Furthermore if X is (II)-free, we determine the ideal
structure of O_X.

the sensitivity of the anapole moment to H_rho^0 in the odd proton nucleus
133Cs, there is a combination of weak meson-nucleon couplings which satisfies
both experiments and which is (barely) in agreement with theory. In addition,
the anapole moment measurement in 205Tl gives a constraint which is
inconsistent with the value from 133Cs, calling into question the theory of
nuclear anapole moments. We argue that measurements of directional asymmetry in
n+p-->d+gamma and in the photo-disintegration of the deuteron by circularly
polarized photons, combined with results from pp scattering, would determine
H_pi^1 and several other weak meson-nucleon couplings in a model-independent
way.

an electron in a constant magnetic field and an ultraintense plane wave is
numerically found to be quasiperiodic even in the high-$a$ limit if the
magnetic field is not too strong, as suggested by previous analytical work. A
strong magnetic field causes highly chaotic electron motion and the boundary of
the highly chaotic region of parameter space is determined numerically.
