possible causes of this effect. We find that the data are fit by either a
factor of 1.7 - 2.4 deficiency of galaxies out to a redshift of z = 0.10 -
0.23, depending on the k corrections and evolution (e-) corrections used and
the adopted values of the Schechter luminosity function parameters, or by
unexpectedly strong low redshift evolution in the K-band, leading to
(e+k)-corrections at z= 0.5 that are as much as 60% larger than accepted

scales of several hundred Mpc exceeds the global value of H_0 by up to 30% and
that the amplitude of very large scale density fluctuations is far larger than
expected in any current cosmogonic scenario. The latter possibility would mean
that even the apparently most secure aspects of our understanding of galaxy

proposed. In our scenario, a highly evolved central core in the dense galactic
nucleus is formed containing a subsystem of compact stellar remnants (CSRs),
such as neutron stars and black holes. Those subsystems result from the
dynamical evolution of dense central stellar clusters in the galactic nuclei
through merging of stars, thereby forming (as has been realized by many
authors) the short-living massive stars and then CSRs. We estimate the rate of
random CSR collisions in the evolved galactic nuclei by taking into account,
similar to Quinlan & Shapiro (1987), the dissipative encounters of CSRs, mainly
due to radiative losses of gravitational waves, which results in the formation
of intermediate short-living binaries, with further coalescence of the
companions to produce GRBs. We also consider how the possible presence of a
central supermassive black hole, formed in a highly evolved galactic nucleus,
influences the CSR binary formation. This scenario does not postulate ad hoc a
required number of tight binary neutron stars in the galaxies. Instead, it
gives, for the most realistic parameters of the evolved nuclei, the expected
rate of GRBs consistent with the observed one, thereby explaining the GRB
appearance in a natural way of the dynamical evolution of galactic nuclei. In
addition, this scenario provides an opportunity for a cosmological GRB
recurrence, previously considered to be a distinctive feature of GRBs of a
local origin only. We also discuss some other observational tests of the
proposed scenario.

black holes above the critical mass to preclude their evaporation until the

the Doppler effect may give rise to energy accretion in black-holes with large
peculiar motions relative to background. We discuss how cosmological
constraints are modified by the introduction of the critical mass since that
PBHs above it do not disturb the CMBR. We show that there is a large range of
admissible masses for PBHs above the critical mass but well below the

We find strong luminosity segregation for our total sample over the magnitude
range of $-20 \leq M_R \leq -16$, which is not entirely accounted for in terms
of the morphology-density relation that is known to exist only for bright
galaxies. We use a single consistent parameter, the degree of luminosity
concentration, to parameterize the morphology of galaxies over the wide
magnitude range, where both giant and dwarf galaxies are included. Galaxies
with high central concentration (HCC) show strong luminosity segregation, i.e.
their clustering strength depends strongly on luminosity while those with low
central concentration (LCC) show almost no luminosity segregation. Radial
density profile shows that brighter HCC-type galaxies tend to more strongly
concentrate near the cluster center while LCC-type galaxies do not show such a
dependence on luminosity. We show that these results are tenable against the

using the fourth root of the average plaquette $u_{0,P}$. Simulations are done
for $c\bar c$, $b\bar c$, and $b\bar b$ systems. The hyperfine splittings are
computed both at leading and at next-to-leading order in the relativistic
expansion. Results are obtained at lattice spacings in the range of about
0.14~fm to 0.38~fm. A number of features emerge, all of which favor tadpole
renormalization using $u_{0,L}$. This includes much better scaling behavior of
the hyperfine splittings in the three quarkonium systems when $u_{0,L}$ is
used. We also find that relativistic corrections to the spin splittings are
smaller when $u_{0,L}$ is used, particularly for the $c\bar c$ and $b\bar c$
systems. We also see signs of a breakdown in the NRQCD expansion when the bare
quark mass falls below about one in lattice units. Simulations with $u_{0,L}$
also appear to be better behaved in this context: the bare quark masses turn
out to be larger when $u_{0,L}$ is used, compared to when $u_{0,P}$ is used on
lattices with comparable spacings. These results also demonstrate the need to
go beyond tree-level tadpole improvement for precision simulations.

investigated. The off-shell effect not included in the Boltzmann-like equation
is important for the decay process when the temperature becomes much below the
mass of unstable particle. When the off-shell effect is taken into account, the
thermal abundance of unstable particles at low temperatures has a power law
behavior of temperature $T$, $\frac{\Gamma}{M}(\frac{T}{M})^{\alpha + 1}$
unlike the Boltzmann suppressed $e^{-M/T}$, with the power $\alpha $ related to
the spectral rise near the threshold of the decay and with $\Gamma $ the decay
rate. Moreover, the relaxation time towards the thermal value is not governed
by the exponential law; instead, it is the power law of time. The evolution
equation for the occupation number and the number density of the unstable
particle is derived, when both of these effects, along with the cosmic
expansion, are included. We also critically examine how the scattering off
thermal particles may affect the off-shell effect to the unstable particle. As
an application showing the importance of the off-shell effect we compute the
time evolution of the baryon asymmetry generated by the heavy $X$ boson decay.

primitive homology class. The space of genus g curves in the class of C is g
dimensional. We count the number of such curves that pass through g generic
points and we also count the number of curves in the fixed linear system |C|
passing through g-2 generic points. These two numbers, (defined appropriately)
only depend on n and g where 2n=C^2+2-2g and not on the particular X or C (n is
the number of nodes when a curve is nodal and reduced).
  Gottsche conjectured that certain quasi-modular forms are the generating
functions for the number of curves in a fixed linear system. Our theorem proves
his formulas and shows that (a different) modular form also arises in the
problem of counting curves without fixing a linear system. We use techniques
that were developed in our earlier paper for similar questions on K3 surfaces.
The techniques include Gromov-Witten invariants for families and a degeneration
to an elliptic fibration. One new feature of the Abelian surface case is the
presence of non-trivial Pic^0(X). We show that for any surface S the cycle in
the moduli space of stable maps defined by requiring that the image of the map
lies in a fixed linear system is homologous to the cycle defined by requiring
the image of the map meets b_1 generic loops in S representing the generators
of the first integral homology group (mod torsion).

deformation of these characters. As a consequence we prove that after suitable
normalization, the coefficients of these polynomials are themselves polynomials
in the parameter with positive integral coefficients. This generalizes our
earlier joint work with F. Knop on Jack polynomials.

monoidal structure. Such things abound in nature; simplicial sets and chain
complexes of abelian groups are examples. Given a monoidal model category, one
can consider monoids and modules over a given monoid. We would like to be able
to study the homotopy theory of these monoids and modules. This question was
first addressed by Stefan Schwede and Brooke Shipley in ""Algebras and modules
in monoidal model categories"", who showed that under certain conditions, there
are model categories of monoids and of modules over a given monoid. This paper
is a follow-up to that one. We study what happens when the conditions of
Schwede-Shipley do not hold. This will happen in any topological situation, and
in particular, in topological symmetric spectra. We find that, with no
conditions on our monoidal model category except that it be cofibrantly
generated and that the unit be cofibrant, we still obtain a homotopy category
of monoids, and that this homotopy category is homotopy invariant in an
appropriate sense.
