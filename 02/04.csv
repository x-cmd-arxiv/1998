temperature distribution and flux anisotropy caused by the magnetized
atmosphere. We include curved spacetime effects on photon trajectories and
magnetic field. The observed gamma-ray pulse profiles are double peaked with
phase separations of 0.4 - 0.5 between the peaks. Assuming that the gamma-ray
profiles are due to emission in a hollow cone centered on the magnetic pole, we
derive the constraints on the phase space of obliquity and observer angles, for
different gamma-ray beam sizes, required to produce the observed gamma-ray peak
phase separations. We compare the constraints from the X-ray emission to those
derived from the observed gamma-ray pulse profiles, and find that the
overlapping phase space requires both obliquity and observer angles to be
smaller than 20-30 degrees, implying gamma-ray beam opening angles of at most
30-35 degrees.

near L1, where the stream of common envelope gas strips matter off the stellar

The first reveals variations parallel to the major axis in emission line ratios
in the halo gas at z=700 pc. It is found that filaments of Halpha emission show
lower values of [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha and [OI]/Halpha. Although this
result is expected if the filaments represent the walls of evacuated chimneys,
it merely reflects a more general correlation of these ratios with Halpha
surface brightness along the slit, and may simply arise from radiation dilution
effects. Much more interesting information on the nature of this gaseous halo
comes from the second observation, which shows the vertical dependence of
[NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, [OI]/Halpha, and [OIII]/Hbeta through the brightest
region of the DIG halo. The most surprising result, in complete contradiction
to models in which the DIG is ionized by massive stars in the disk, is that
[OIII]/Hbeta rises with height above the plane for z>1 kpc (even as
[NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha are rising, in line with
expectations from such models). The run of [SII]/[NII] is also problematic,
showing essentially no contrast with z. The [OIII] emission probably arises
from shocks, turbulent mixing layers, or some other secondary source of
ionization. Composite models in which the line emission comes from a mix of
photo-ionized gas and shocks or turbulent mixing layers are considered in

However, the energy of the K-edge of oxygen is consistent with neutral material
(at the redshift of the cluster) and is not consistent with any ionized state
of oxygen. It is not possible to completely ionize helium and have oxygen
neutral so the apparent helium deficiency cannot be due to ionization. We

of a medium in which helium remains ionized. This model satisfies all the

compared with the results of synthetic line calculations in three-dimensional

3He is inside of aerogel. Aerogel is a very porous substance, where 98% of the
volume can be empty. The purpose is to understand how the properties of the
superfluid are modified when the quasiparticles are scattered from an impurity,
such as aerogel. We study extensively the ""homogeneous scattering model"". From
it we derive the Ginzburg-Landau theory of impure superfluid 3He. We give
expressions for measurable quantities and compare them with experiments. We
consider random anisotropy and its effect on the NMR properties. More
sophisticated scattering models are briefly discussed.

the representations in metric variables and in Ashtekar variables. A space of
five states in the metric representation is generated from the single physical

that additional discrete (permutation) symmetries of physical states arise in

of a wormhole groundstate and a Hartle-Hawking `no-boundary' state,

and upon which fundamental fields inhabit the space-time. We calculate this

non-perturbative. We treat fields of spin $0,1/2,1$ coupled to the
gravitational background only. The heat kernels and/or zeta-functions for the
various spins are related to that of a non-minimally coupled one. A WKB
approximation is used in obtaining the radial part of that heat kernel. The

possibility of a closed universe, $K=+1$, as these turn out to have an
overwhelming tendency towards a fast collapse - the details such as the rate of
this collapse depends on the structure of the underlying quantum degrees of

$K=-1$ and K=0 will in general lead to macroscopic universes, and of these
$K=-1$ seems to be more favourable. The possibility of the scale factor being a
concave rather than a convex function potentially indicates that the problem of
the large Hubble constant is non-existent as the age of the universe need not
be less than or equal to the Hubble time. Note should be given to the fact,
however, that we are not able to pursue the numerical study to really large

two-dimensional subalgebras of the symmetry algebra and their corresponding
subgroups, yield notable field equations in lower dimensions whose solutions
allow to find exact solutions to the original equation. Some reduced equations
turn out to be related to potentials of physical interest, such as the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam and the Killingbeck potentials, and others. An instanton-like
approximate solution is also obtained which reproduces the Eguchi-Hanson
instanton configuration for $\gamma\to\infty$. Furthermore, the equation under
consideration is extended to $(n+1)$--dimensions. A spherically symmetric form
of this equation, studied by means of the symmetry approach, provides
conformally invariant classes of field equations comprising remarkable special
cases. One of these $(n=4)$ enables us to establish a connection with the
Euclidean Yang-Mills equations, another appears in the context of Differential
Geometry in relation to the socalled Yamabe problem. All the properties of the

distributions of atomic clusters are calculated using a Woods-Saxon single
particle potential. The same entropies are also calculated for nuclear
distributions according to the Skyrme parametrization of the nuclear mean
field. It turns out that a similar functional form S=a+b ln N for the entropy
as function of the number of particles N holds approximately for atoms, nuclei
and atomic clusters. It is conjectured that this is a universal property of a
many-fermion system in a mean field. It is also seen that there is an analogy
of our expression for S to Boltzmann's thermodynamic entropy S=k ln W.
