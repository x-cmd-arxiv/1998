  fig. numbering error",,"10.1086/311280",,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  There is substantial evidence that the initial mass function (IMF) may be a
function of the local star formation conditions. In particular, the IMF is
predicted to flatten with increasing local luminosity density, with the
formation of massive stars being preferentially enhanced in brighter regions.
If IMF gradients are general features of galaxies, several previous
astrophysical measurements, such as the surface mass densities of spirals
(obtained assuming constant mass to light ratios), were plagued by substantial
systematic errors. In this Letter, calculations which account for possible IMF
gradients are presented of surface densities of spiral galaxies. Compared to
previous estimates, the mass densities corrected for IMF gradients are higher
in the outer regions of the disks. For a model based on the Milky Way but with
an IMF scaled according to R136, the rotation curve without the traditional
dark halo component falls with Galactocentric radius, though slower than it
would without IMF gradients. For a second model of the Milky Way in which the
IMF gradient is increased by 50%, the rotation curve is approximately flat in
the outer disk, with a rotational velocity below ~220 km/s only before the
traditional dark halo component is added. These results, if generalizable to
other galaxies, not only call into question the assertion that dark matter
halos are compatible with the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies, but also
may clarify our understanding of a wide variety of other astrophysical
phenomena such as the G-dwarf problem, metallicity gradients, and the
Tully-Fisher relation.

describe the basic mechanisms by which axions are created in the early
universe, both in the standard thermal scenario in which axion strings form and
in inflationary models. In the thermal scenario, the dominant process for axion
production is through the radiative decay of an axion string network, which
implies a dark matter axion of mass m_a ~ 100 microeV with specified large
uncertainties. An inflationary phase does not affect this string bound if the
reheat temperature is high T_reh > f_a or, conversely, for T_reh < f_a, if the
Hubble parameter during inflation is large H_1 > f_a; in both cases, strings
form and we return to the standard picture with a m_a ~ 100 microeV dark matter
axion. Inflationary models with f_a > H_1 > T_reh face strong CMBR constraints
and require `anthropic misalignment' fine-tuning in order to produce a dark
matter axion; in this case, some inflation models are essentially incompatible
with a detectable axion, while others can be engineered to allow a dark matter
axion anywhere in a huge mass range below m_a < 1 meV. We endeavour to clarify
the sometimes confusing and contradictory literature on axion cosmology.

significant fraction of the total mass of the halo of the Milky Way.
Constraints on the population of halo white dwarfs from the HDF can directly
address this possible partial explanation of the nature of the dark halo of the
Milky Way. In this review, I illustrate how the HDF can be used to constrain
the luminosity function of halo white dwarfs. I begin with a brief summary of
the observed white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) of the galactic disk, and
show how the HDF serves as a probe of the WDLF for the halo. I then review the
theoretical background used in interpreting the WDLF in terms of the theory of
white dwarf evolution and cooling, and the history of star formation in the
galaxy. We are then in a position to explore the theoretical WDLF of the disk.
and then the halo. The results of searches for white dwarfs on the HDF can then
be examined in terms of the halo white dwarf population.

wings with emission extending to V(LSR) = 130 kms. This is the first
simultaneous detection of two emission lines towards a high velocity cloud,
allowing us to form the ratio of these line profiles as a function of LSR
velocity. At both cloud positions, we see a clear distinction between emission
at the cloud velocity, and the Reynolds layer emission (V(LSR) = 0). The
[NII]/H-alpha ratio (=0.25) for the Reynolds layer is typical of the warm
ionised medium. At the cloud velocity, this ratio is enhanced by a factor of
3-4 compared to emission at rest with respect to the LSR. A moderately deep
upper limit at [OIII] (0.12R at 3-sigma) was derived from our data. If the
emission arises from dilute photoionisation from hot young stars, the highly
enhanced [NII]/H-alpha ratio, the [OIII] non-detection and weak H-alpha
emission (0.24-0.30R) suggest that the Smith Cloud is 26+/-4 kpc from the Sun,
at a Galactocentric radius of 20+/-4 kpc. This value assumes that the emission
arises from an optically thick slab, with a covering fraction of unity as seen
by the ionizing photons, whose orientation is either (a) parallel to the
Galactic disk, or (b) such as to maximize the received flux from the disk. The

adopt a formulation in which the ions and neutrals each are treated as separate
fluids coupled only through a collisional drag term. Ionization and
recombination processes are not considered. The linear stability of the
ion-neutral system has been previously considered by Blaes and Balbus (1994).
Here we extend their results into the nonlinear regime by computing the
evolution of Keplerian angular momentum distribution in the local shearing box
approximation. We find significant turbulence and angular momentum transport
when the collisional frequency is on order 100 times the orbital frequency. At
higher collision rates, the two-fluid system studied here behaves much like the
fully ionized systems studied previously. At lower collision rates the
evolution of the instability is determined primarily by the properties of the
ions, with the neutrals acting as a sink for the turbulence. Since in this
regime saturation occurs when the magnetic field is superthermal with respect
to the ion pressure, we find the amplitude of the magnetic energy and the
corresponding angular momentum transport rate is proportional to the ion
density. Our calculations show the ions and neutrals are essentially decoupled
when the collision frequency is less than 0.01 times the orbital frequency; in
this case the ion fluid behaves as in the single fluid simulations and the
neutrals remain quiescent. We find that purely toroidal initial magnetic field
configurations are unstable to the magnetorotational instability across the

They have been applied to quantum spin models and field theories at finite
temperature. The models considered are subject to a global ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry
or to an even larger symmetry group such as O(N) with $N\geq 2$. In this paper
we are concerned with the technical details of series computations to allow for
a nontrivial vacuum expectation value $<\rho(x)>\not=0$, which is typical for
models that break a global ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry. Examples are scalar fields
coupled to an external field, or manifestly gauge invariant effective models of
Higgs field condensates in the electroweak theory, even in the high temperature
phase. A nonvanishing tadpole implies an enormous proliferation of graphs and
limits the graphical series computation to the 10th order. To achieve the
hopping parameter series to comparable order as in the ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetric
case, the graphical expansion is replaced by an expansion into new algebraic
objects called vertex structures. In this way the 18th order becomes feasible.

component of the quantum vacuum and propose this as an alternative to Mach's
principle. Preliminary analysis of the momentum flux of the classical
zero-point radiation impinging on accelerated objects as viewed by an inertial
observer suggests that the resistance to acceleration attributed to inertia may
be at least in part a force of opposition originating in the vacuum. This
analysis avoids the ad hoc modeling of particle-field interaction dynamics used
previously to derive a similar result. This present approach is not dependent
upon what happens at the particle point, but on how an external observer
assesses the kinematical characteristics of the zero-point radiation impinging
on the accelerated object. A relativistic form of the equation of motion
results from the present analysis. Its covariant form yields a simple result
that may be interpreted as a contribution to inertial mass. Our approach is
related by the principle of equivalence to Sakharov's conjecture of a
connection between Einstein action and the vacuum. The argument presented may
thus be construed as a descendant of Sakharov's conjecture by which we attempt
to attribute a mass-giving property to the electromagnetic component -- and
possibly other components-- of the vacuum. In this view the physical momentum
of an object is related to the radiative momentum flux of the vacuum
instantaneously contained in the characteristic proper volume of the object.
The interaction process between the accelerated object and the vacuum (akin to
absorption or scattering of electromagnetic radiation) appears to generate a
physical resistance (reaction force) to acceleration suggestive of what has
been historically known as inertia.

that the inertia of matter could be interpreted at least in part as a reaction
force originating in interactions between the electromagnetic zero-point field
(ZPF) and the elementary charged consitutents (quarks and electrons) of matter.
Within the limited context of that analysis, it appeared that Newton's equation
of motion, f=ma, could be inferred from Maxwell's equations as applied to the
ZPF, i.e. the stochastic electrodynamics (SED) version of the quantum vacuum.
We report on a new approach which avoids the ad hoc particle-field interaction
model (Planck oscillator) of that analysis, as well as its concomitant
formulational complexity. Instead, it is shown that a non-zero ZPF momentum
flux arises naturally in accelerating coordinate frames from the standard
relativistic transformations of electromagnetic fields. Scattering of this ZPF
momentum flux by an object will yield a reaction force that may be interpreted
as a contribution to the object's inertia. This new formulation is properly
covariant yielding the relativistic equation of motion. Our approach is related
by the principle of equivalence to Sakharov's conjecture of a connection
between Einstein action and the vacuum. If correct, this concept would
substitute for Mach's principle and imply that no further mass-giving
Higgs-type fields may be required to explain the inertia of material objects,
although extensions to include the zero-point fields of the other fundamental
interactions may be necessary for a complete theory of inertia.
