that it now has broad emission lines of considerable strength, eliminating it
as a ""type 2 QSO"" candidate. We suggest that the behavior of 1E 0449.4-1823 is
the same as that of some Seyfert 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies, in which Goodrich
attributed long-term variations of their broad Balmer lines to dynamical
motions of obscuring material located in or around the broad-line region. The
optical continuum and broad emission-line regions of 1E 0449.4-1823 may still
be partly covered in our line of sight, which would explain its large
forbidden-line equivalent widths and flat alpha_ox relative to other
low-redshift QSOs. Also present are apparent absorption features in the broad
Balmer lines and in Mg II, which may be related to the past obscuration and
current emergence of the broad-line region. However, it is difficult to
distinguish absorption from broad emission-line peaks that are displaced in
velocity; we consider the latter a plausible competing interpretation of these
peculiar line profiles. An ASCA X-ray spectrum of 1E 0449.4-1823 can be fitted
with a power-law of Gamma = 1.63, intrinsic N_H < 9 x 10^20 cm-2, and no Fe
Kalpha line emission. Its 2-10 keV luminosity is 6.7 x 10^44 ergs/s. With
regard to the still hypothetical type 2 QSOs, we argue that there is little
evidence for the existence of any among X-ray selected samples.

high level of noise variability, the so-called High Frequency Noise (HFN) with
a fractional Root Mean Squared (RMS) of about 25% in the 2E-3 - 40 Hz range.
The strong HFN together with the hardness of its X-ray spectrum suggest that
1E1724-3045 is an ``Atoll'' source which was in its ``Island'' state during the
observation. The Fourier Power Density Spectra (PDS) can be modeled in terms of
the sum of two ``shot noise'' components for which the shots have a single-side
exponential shape. The characteristic shot decay timescales inferred from the
best fitting of the PDS are ~680 and 16 msec respectively. The two components
contribute similarly to the total RMS (about 15%). The PDS contains also a
third component: a broad and asymmetric peaked noise feature centered at 0.8
Hz. This Quasi Periodic Oscillation-like (QPO) feature contributes at the level
of ~ 10% to the total RMS. The integrated RMS of all three components shows a
positive correlation with energy up to at least 40 keV. We also show that
1E1724-3045 has striking timing similarities with the black hole candidate GRO
J0422+32 (Nova Persei 1992). Our observation demonstrates that a low frequency
QPO simultaneously with a high level of RMS is not a timing signature unique to
black holes. This extends the growing list of similarities between Atoll
sources and black hole systems.

result is that subgroup 1a is located at about 330 pc from the Sun, much closer

other subgroups of the association and the Orion molecular clouds.
Unfortunately, due to the unfavorable kinematics of the association with
respect to the Galactic background, Hipparcos proper motions do not allow a
clear kinematic separation of the association from the field. For this purpose
accurate and homogeneous radial velocities are needed. Traditionally, the
massive O and B stars have received most of the attention in the studies of OB
associations. However, we will present results showing that significant numbers
of low-mass stars are associated with Orion OB1. Unbiased, optically complete,
spectroscopic and photometric surveys of areas within subgroups 1a and 1b have
the potential to determine the complete low-mass stellar population, down to
the brown dwarf limit. This will provide much insight into the overall initial
mass function and studies of the kinematics of the low-mass stars will yield
insights into the dispersal of the association.

constructed from samples of QSOs defined by their soft X-ray brightness. X-ray
bright (XB) composites show stronger emission lines in general, but
particularly from the narrow line region. The difference in the [OIII]/Hbeta
ratio is particularly striking, and even more so when blended FeII emission is
properly subtracted. The correlation of this ratio with X-ray brightness were
principal components of QSO spectral diversity found by Boroson & Green (1992).
We find here that other, much weaker narrow optical forbidden lines ([OII] and
NeV) are enhanced by factors of 2 to 3 in our XB composites, and that narrow
line emission is also strongly enhanced in the XB UV composite. Broad permitted
line fluxes are slightly larger for all XB spectra, but the narrow/broad line
ratio stays similar or increases strongly with X-ray brightness for all strong
permitted lines except Hbeta.
  Spectral differences between samples divided by their relative X-ray
brightness (as measured by alpha_{ox}) exceed those seen between complementary
samples divided by luminosity or radio loudness. We propose that the Baldwin
effect may be a secondary correlation to the primary relationship between
alpha_{ox} and emission line equivalent width. We conclude that either 1)
equivalent width depends strongly on the SHAPE of the ionizing continuum, as
crudely characterized here by alpha_{ox} or 2) both equivalent width and
alpha_{ox} are related to some third parameter characterizing the QSO physics.
One such possibility is intrinsic warm absorption; a soft X-ray absorber
situated between the broad and narrow line regions can successfully account for
many of the properties observed.

results in a greatly reduced scatter in the Lx-T relation; cooling flow
clusters are similar to others outside the small cooling flow regions. For a
fit of the form L_bol ~ T^alpha, we obtain alpha=2.64+-0.27 (90%) and a
residual rms scatter in log L_bol of 0.10. The derived relation can be directly
compared to theoretical predictions that do not include radiative cooling. It
also provides an accurate reference point for future evolution searches and
comparison to cooler clusters.
  The new temperatures together with a newly selected cluster sample are used
to update the temperature function at z~0.05. The resulting function is
generally higher and flatter than the previous estimates by Edge et al (1990)

that the new data place on the density fluctuation spectrum, we apply the
Press-Schechter formalism for Omega=1 and 0.3. For Omega=1, assuming cluster
isothermality, the temperature function implies sigma_8=0.55+-0.03, while
taking into account the observed cluster temperature profiles,
sigma_8=0.51+-0.03, consistent with the previously derived range. The
dependence of sigma_8 on Omega differs from earlier findings, because of our
treatment of n as a free parameter. We find n=-(2.0-2.3)+-0.3, somewhat steeper
than derived from the earlier temperature function data, in agreement with the

the 0.130 Hz neutron star spin frequency. Power density spectra of observations
made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer show significant sidebands separated
from the pulsar spin frequency (and its harmonics) by the QPO frequency. These
show that the instantaneous amplitude of the coherent pulsations is modulated
by the amplitude of the QPOs. This phenomenon is expected in models such as the
magnetospheric beat frequency model where the QPOs originate near the polar
caps of the neutron star. In the 4--8 keV energy range, however, the
lower-frequency sidebands are significantly stronger than their
higher-frequency complements; this is inconsistent with the magnetospheric beat
frequency model. We suggest that the 0.048 Hz QPOs are instead produced by a
structure orbiting the neutron star at the QPO frequency. This structure
crosses the line of sight once per orbit and attenuates the pulsar beam,
producing the symmetric (amplitude modulation) sidebands. It also reprocesses
the pulsar beam at the beat frequencies between the neutron star spin frequency
and the QPOs, producing the excess variability observed in the lower-frequency
sidebands. Quite independently, we find no evidence that the red noise
variability modulates the amplitude of the coherent pulsations. This is also in
contrast to the expectations of the magnetospheric beat frequency model and
differs from the behavior in some high-mass X-ray binary pulsars.

instance, increasing the gas density from 0.01 cm^{-3} to 0.1 cm^{-3} would
decrease the required hot gas mass by the same factor, and could possibly
alleviate constraints on cosmological structure formation models. The pressure
in this gas would be very high (10^{-9} dynes cm^{-2}), comparable to the
pressure in the optical line emitting nebulosity and to the minimum pressure in
the radio source, and the cooling time would be short (< fewx10^{8} years).
Circumstantial evidence for such very dense, hot gas enveloping some high z
radio sources has been reviewed by Fabian et al. (1986). Fabian (1991) suggests
that in some cases the `inferred pressures are close to the maximum that can be
obtained by gas cooling in a potential well of a galaxy' (ie. the cooling time
= gravitational free-fall time), and he designates such systems as `maximal
cooling flows', with implied cooling flow rates up to 2000 M_solar year^{-1}.
High resolution X-ray imaging with AXAF should be able to test whether 1138-262

antiferromagnetic insulator within a representation involving multiple orbitals
per site. Impurity scattering of magnons is found to be strong when the number
of orbitals N' on impurity sites is different from the number N on host sites.
The impurity-scattering-induced softening of magnon modes leads to enhancement
in thermal excitation of magnons, and hence to a lowering of the Neel
temperature in layered or three dimensional systems. Weak impurity scattering
of magnons is obtained in the case N'=N, where the impurity is represented in
terms of modified hopping strength, and a momentum-independent, multiplicative
renormalization of magnon energies is obtained. Split-off magnon modes are
obtained when the impurity-host coupling is stronger, and implications are
discussed for two-magnon Raman scattering. The mapping between antiferromagnets
and superconductors is utilized to contrast formation of impurity-induced
states.

usually thought one-dimensional in the conventional mean-variance approach, has
to be addressed by the full distribution of losses. Furthermore, the
time-horizon of the investment is shown to play a major role. We show the
importance of accounting for large fluctuations and use the theory of Cram\'er
for large deviations in this context. We first treat a simple model with a
single risky asset that examplifies the distinction between the average return
and the typical return, the role of large deviations in multiplicative
processes, and the different optimal strategies for the investors depending on
their size. We then analyze the case of assets whose price variations are
distributed according to exponential laws, a situation that is found to
describe reasonably well daily price variations. Several portfolio optimization
strategies are presented that aim at controlling large risks. We end by
extending the standard mean-variance portfolio optimization theory, first
within the quasi-Gaussian approximation and then using a general formulation
for non-Gaussian correlated assets in terms of the formalism of functional
integrals developed in the field theory of critical phenomena.

search for beyond Standard Model physics, probing already now the TeV scale, on
which new physics should manifest itself. These possibilities are reviewed
here. First, the results of present generation experiments are presented. The
most sensitive one of them -- the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment in the Gran
Sasso -- probes the electron mass now in the sub eV region and will reach a
limit of $\sim$ 0.1 eV in a few years. Basing to a large extent on the
theoretical work of the Heidelberg Double Beta Group in the last two years,
results are obtained also for SUSY models (R-parity breaking, sneutrino mass),
leptoquarks (leptoquark-Higgs coupling), compositeness, right-handed W boson
mass and others. These results are comfortably competitive to corresponding
results from high-energy accelerators like TEVATRON, HERA, etc. Second, future
perspectives of $\beta\beta$ research are discussed. A new Heidelberg
experimental proposal (GENIUS) is presented which would allow to increase the
sensitivity for Majorana neutrino masses from the present level of at best 0.1
eV down to 0.01 or even 0.001 eV. Its physical potential would be a
breakthrough into the multi-TeV range for many beyond standard models. Its
sensitivity for neutrino oscillation parameters would be larger than of all
present terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments and of those planned for
the future. It could probe directly the atmospheric neutrino problem and even
the large angle solution of the solar neutrino problem. It would further,
already in a first step, cover almost the full MSSM parameter space for
prediction of neutralinos as cold dark matter, making the experiment
competitive to LHC in the search for supersymmetry.

considered as Planck scale virtual black holes appearing and annihilating in
pairs. Incident fields scattering from such fluctuations would lose quantum
coherence.
  In a recent paper (hep-th/9705147), Hawking and Ross obtained an estimate for
the magnitude of this loss in the case of a scalar field. Their calculation
exploited the separability of the conformally invariant scalar wave equation in
the electrovac C metric background, which is justified as a sufficiently good
description of a virtual black hole pair in the limit considered.
  In anticipation of extending this result, the Teukolsky equations for
incident fields of higher spin are separated on the vacuum C metric background
and solved in the same limit. With the exception of spin 2 fields, these
equations are shown in addition to be valid on the electrovac C metric
background. The angular solutions are found to reduce to the spin- weighted
spherical harmonics, and the radial solutions are found to approach
hypergeometrics close to the horizons.
  By defining appropriate scattering boundary conditions, these solutions are
then used to estimate the transmission and reflection coefficients for an
incident field of spin s. The transmission coefficient is required in order to
estimate the loss of quantum coherence of an incident field through scattering
off virtual black holes.
