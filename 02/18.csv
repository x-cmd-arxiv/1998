a prototype for low mass X-ray binaries as a class. It has been suggested that
the UV and optical emission arise as a result of reprocessing of X-rays, and
that a likely site for such reprocessing is an accretion disk around the X-ray
source. If UV and optical emission are enhanced by reprocessing of X-rays, the
X-ray variability may be manifest in UV emission: we test this by using high
temporal resolution UV data obtained simultaneously with high temporal
resolution X-ray data obtained simultaneously with the GHRS on the Hubble Space
Telescope, and with the X-ray Timing Explorer (XTE). We analyze the variability
behavior of the UV spectrum and of the X-rays, and we also measure the
properties of the emission line profiles as viewed at high resolution with the
echelle gratings. The variability behavior does not provide direct support of
the reprocessing scenario, although the correlated variability between UV and
X-rays does not conflict with this hypothesis. Furthermore, the emission line
profiles do not fit with simple models for disk emission lines.

primordial power spectrum in 20 steps in $\log k$ to $k\leq 0.5h$Mpc$^{-1}$ can
be determined to $\sim 16%$ accuracy for $k\sim 0.01h$Mpc$^{-1}$, and to $\sim
1%$ accuracy for $k\sim 0.1h$Mpc$^{-1}$. The uncertainty in the primordial
power spectrum increases by a factor up to 3 on small scales if we solve
simultaneously for the dimensionless Hubble constant $h$, the cosmological
constant ${\Lambda}$, the baryon fraction $\Omega_b$, the reionization optical
depth $\tau_{ri}$, and the effective bias between the matter density field and
the redshift space galaxy density field $b_{\it eff}$. Alternately, if we
restrict $A_S^2(k)$ to be a power law, we find that inclusion of the SDSS data
breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude of the power spectrum and the
optical depth inherent in the MAP data, significantly reduces the uncertainties
in the determination of the matter density and the cosmological constant, and
allows a determination of the galaxy bias parameter. Thus, combining the MAP
and SDSS data allows the independent measurement of important cosmological
parameters, and a measurement of the primordial power spectrum independent of
inflationary models, giving us valuable information on physics in the early
Universe, and providing clues to the correct inflationary model.

the exponential decay of luminosity following an outburst in black hole

dimensionless viscosity, $\alpha=35(c_s/r\Omega)^{3/2}$. This result can be
understood in terms of a simple model of the evolution of cooling fronts in
accretion disks. In particular, the cooling front speed during decline is $\sim
\alpha_F c_{s,F}(c_{s,F}/r\Omega)^{n}$, where $F$ denotes the position of the
cooling front, and the exact value of $n$ depends on the hot state opacity,
(although generally $n\approx 1/2$). Setting this speed proportional to $r$
constrains the functional form of $\alpha$ in the hot phase of the disk, which
sets it apart from previous arguments based on the relative durations of

line intensities for: a) the whole nebula; b) for a slit crossing the nebula;

He and N in planetary nebulae with high stellar temperature. The geometrical

nature and importance of jets associated with active nuclei and compact
objects. After a short introduction on jets in radio galaxies and radio loud
quasars the paper focuses on jets in other source types, such as radio-quiet
quasars, Seyfert and LINER galaxies, and stellar mass black holes. Radio
observations of quasars, for example, have brought new evidence for the
existence of relativistic jets in radio quiet quasars, while HST and VLA
observations of Seyfert galaxies have now clearly established not only the
presence of radio jets, but also the great importance these jets have for the
morphology and the excitation of the emission line region in these AGN.
Moreover, a recent VLA survey found a large fraction of low-luminosity AGN to
host compact, flat-spectrum radio cores indicating the presence of radio jets
there as well. Finally the jet/disk-symbiosis model, which successfully
explains radio cores in LINER galaxies, is applied to the stellar mass black
hole GRS 1915+105, indicating that the radio cores in both types of sources are
just different sides of the same coin. The conclusion drawn from all these
observations is that radio jets are a ubiquitous feature of most---if not
all---AGN and play an important effect in the overall energy budget, as well as
for the interpretation of observations in other wavebands (e.g. optical
emission lines).

data by Verheijen (1997). The galaxies are roughly all at the same distance (15
to 16 Mpc). The radio observations are made with the Westerbork Synthesis Array
which means that the linear resolution of all rotation curves is comparable.
The greatest advantage of this sample is the existance of K'-band surface
photometry for all galaxies; the near-infrared emission, being relatively free
of the effects of dust absorption and less sensitive to recent star formation,
is a more precise tracer of the mean radial distribution of the dominant
stellar population. The predicted rotation curves are calculated from the
K'-band surface photometry and the observed distribution of neutral hydrogen
using the simple MOND prescription where the one adjustable parameter is the
mass of the stellar disk or the implied mass-to-light ratio. The predicted
rotation curves generally agree with the observed curves and the mean M/L in
the near-infrared is about 0.9 with a small dispersion. The fitted M/L in the
B-band is correlated with B-V color in the sense predicted by population
synthesis models. Including earlier work, about 80 galaxy rotation curves are
now well-reproduced from the observed distribution of detectable matter using
the MOND formula to calculate the gravitational acceleration; this lends
considerable observational support to Milgrom's unconventional hypothesis.

folding energy ~100 keV, a spectral form that is consistent with thermal
Comptonization. This ""breaking gamma-ray state"" is the high-energy extension of

For $t_{\perp}<t_{\perp c}$, as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes
a crossesover from the Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid to an incipient
one-dimensional Mott insulator and finally makes a phase transition into an
antiferromagnetic long-range-ordered phase at a transition temperature $T_{N}$
which increases with the increasing $t_{\perp}$. For $t_{\perp}>t_{\perp c}$,
the system undergoes a crossesover from the TL liquid to the Fermiology regime
where the interchain propagation of a quasi-particle is coherent. We discuss
relevance of the present result to the experimentally suggested,
pressure-induced crossover phenomena in the quasi-one-dimensional organic
systems.

between the liquid and solid sectors in the ground state is shown to be
reflected in the density of states $D(E)$, associated with the excitations of

the absence of the Wigner solid environment: $D(E) \sim e^{-\alpha |E|}D_0(E)$.
The coefficient $\alpha$ (which is shown to vanish for a perfectly regular
distribution of electron sites in the solid), is evaluated for two different
realizations of an irregular distribution. We conclude that probing this effect

wormhole will possess two such throats, corresponding to the two orthogonal

they do coalesce into a single throat in the static limit). The divergence
property of the null geodesics at the marginally anti-trapped surface
generalizes the ``flare-out'' condition for an arbitrary wormhole. We derive
theorems regarding violations of the null energy condition (NEC) at and near
these throats and find that, even for wormholes with arbitrary time-dependence,
the violation of the NEC is a generic property of wormhole throats. We also
discuss wormhole throats in the presence of fully antisymmetric torsion and
find that the energy condition violations cannot be dumped into the torsion

Besides Landau damping we consider collisions and density fluctuations as
contributions to the damping of GDR. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function
method we derive a non-Markovian kinetic equation. The linearization of the
latter one leads to complex dispersion relations. The complex solution provides
the centroid energy and the damping width of giant resonances. The experimental
damping widths are the full width half maximum (FWHM) and can be reproduced by
the full width of the structure function. Within simple finite size scaling we
give a relation between the minimal interaction strength which is required for
a collective oscillation and the clustersize. We investigate the damping of
giant dipole resonances within a Skyrme type of interaction. Different
collision integrals are compared with each other in order to incorporate
correlations. The inclusion of a conserving relaxation time approximation
allows to find the $T^2$-dependence of the damping rate with a temperature
known from the Fermi-liquid theory. However, memory effects turn out to be
essential for a proper treatment of the damping of collective modes. We derive
a Landau like formula for the one--particle relaxation time similar to the
damping of zero sound.
