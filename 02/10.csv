those at 1315A by 0.22^{+0.12}_{-0.13} days, 1.25^{+0.48}_{-0.35} days, and
1.84^{+0.93}_{-0.94} days, respectively, based on the centroids of the
cross-correlation functions; the error intervals quoted correspond to 68%
confidence levels, and each of these lags is greater than zero at no less than
97% confidence. We do not find statistically significant interband continuum
lags in NGC 5548, NGC 3783, or Fairall 9. Wavelength-dependent continuum lags
may be marginally detected in the case of NGC 4151. However, on the basis of
theoretical considerations, wavelength-dependent continuum lags in sources
other than NGC 7469 are not expected to have been detectable in previous

fields, induced by these massless fermions in the low-energy corner. The
interaction of the chiral fermions with the gauge field in 3He-A is discussed
in detail. It gives rise to the effect of axial anomaly: conversion of the
charge from the coherent motion of the condensate (vacuum) to the
quasiparticles (matter). The charge of the quasiparticles is thus not
conserved: In other words, matter can be created without creating antimatter.
This effect is instrumental for the vortex dynamics, in which the vortex is the
mediator of conversion of linear momentum from the condensate to the normal
component via the spectral flow in the vortex core. The same effect leads to
the instability of the counterflow in 3He-A, in which the flow of the normal
component (incoherent degrees of freedom) is transformed to the order parameter
texture (coherent degrees of freedom). We discuss the analogs of these
phenomena in high energy physics. The conversion of the momentum from the
vortex to the heat bath is equivalent to the nonconservation of baryon number
in the presence of textures and cosmic strings. The counterflow instability is
equivalent to the generation of the hypermagnetic field via the axial anomaly.
We discuss also an analog of axions and different sources of the mass of the

Ashkin-Teller model with strong but irrelevant bond randomness we find that the
relative squared width, $R_X$, of $P(X)$ is weakly self averaging. $R_X\sim
l^{\alpha/\nu}$, where $\alpha$ is the specific heat exponent and $\nu$ is the

this constant is different for canonical and grand canonical disorder. We study
the distribution of the pseudo-critical temperatures $T_c(i,l)$ of the ensemble

the character of preheating $(\phi \to \chi)$ or $(\phi \to \delta \phi)$ is
