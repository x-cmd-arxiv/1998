  1997, eds. M.J.McCaughrean, A.Burkert, ASP Conference Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This chapter reviews the dynamical processes in young stellar clusters. The
accretion of gas by individual stars affects the dynamics of the cluster, and
the masses of the stars. Dynamical mass segregation cannot explain the degree
of mass segregation observed in clusters such as the Trapezium Cluster in
Orion, implying that the location of the massive stars is an indication of
where they formed. This can, however, be explained by the competitive accretion
model. If most, if not all, stars form in binary systems, then the high
proportion of pre-main sequence binary systems can evolve in clusters to the
smaller proportion of Galactic field stars through binary-binary and
binary-single interactions. These models make definite predictions for the
distribution of binary properties. The early evolution of a cluster sensitively
depends on the primordial binary star proportion. Close encounters between
stars with circum-stellar discs have drastic effects on the discs and on the
stellar orbits. The discs are truncated at radii comparable to the encounter
peri-astron, limiting their lifetimes and affecting their potential for planet
formation. If the gas represents a significant fraction of the total cluster
mass, its removal on dynamical time-scales can unbind the cluster allowing the
stars to escape and populate the field. (shortened)

galaxies in a cold dark matter dominated universe. Isolated haloes, with
circular speeds typical of spiral galaxies, have been selected from a low
resolution numerical simulation for re-simulation at higher resolution with
dark matter and gas components. The initial conditions are evolved with two
smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes, TREESPH and GRAPESPH. In previous SPH
simulations, strong outward transport of angular momentum has led to the
formation of disc-like systems with much smaller angular momenta than observed
in real disc galaxies. Here we investigate whether this problem can be
circumvented if feedback processes prevent disc formation until late epochs.
The results of varying the cooling epoch for each of five different haloes are
analysed. When cooling and star formation occur at early times, stellar discs
are destroyed during merger events and we observe similar catastrophic
transport of angular momentum as seen in previous work. With cooling suppressed
until z=1, discs can form by the present day with angular momenta comparable to
those of observed disc galaxies. We conclude that feedback processes, which
prevent gas from collapsing until late epochs, are an essential ingredient in
disc galaxy formation.

their angular momenta projected antiparallel onto the sky. It follows that if
the two components rotate around the same axis, the counterrotation is
intrinsic. On the contrary the counterrotation is only apparent if the rotation
axes are misaligned and the line-of-sight lies in between the two vectors or
their antivectors. In the case of intrinsic counterrotation the two components
can be superimposed or radially separated. As far as the two components are
concerned, stars are observed to counterrotate with respect to other stars or
gas. The counterrotation of gas versus gas has been also detected. Up to now,
the number of galaxies exhibiting these phenomena are $\sim60$, the
morphological type of which ranges from ellipticals to S0's and to spirals.
  When a second event occurs in a galaxy, such as the acquisition of material
from outside, it is likely that the resulting angular momentum of the acquired
material is decoupled from the angular momentum of the preexisting galaxy.
Counterrotation is therefore a general signature of material acquired from
outside the main confines of the galaxy. Good examples of such cases are
ellipticals with a dust lane or gaseous disk along the minor axis and polar
ring galaxies, where the angular momenta are perpendicular. It should be noted
that recently attempts have been made to explain special cases of stars versus
stars counterrotation in disk galaxies as due to a self induced phenomenon in
non-axisymmetric potentials. We discuss the phenomenon according to the
morphological type and to the kind of counterrotation.

arcsec^{\beta} and the slope \beta=0.9. The slope is the same as in the local
and moderate redshift universe. A slope \beta=0.25 or shallower is ruled out by
the data at the 99.9% confidence level. Because N(z) of LBGs is well determined
from 376 spectroscopic redshifts, the real-space correlation function can be
derived from the angular one through the Limber transform. This inversion is
rather insensitive to the still relatively large errors on A_w and \beta, and
the spatial correlation length is much more tightly constrained than either of
these parameters. We estimate r_0=3.3 -0.6 +0.7 (2.1 -0.5 +0.4) h^{-1} Mpc
(comoving) for q_0=0.1 (0.5) at z=3.04 (h is in units of 100 km/s/Mpc). The
correlation length of LBGs at z=3 is comparable to that of present-day spiral
galaxies and is only about 50% smaller than that of the ellipticals; it is as
large or larger than any measured in galaxy samples at 0.3<z<1. By comparing
the observed galaxy correlation length to that of the mass predicted from CDM
theory, we estimate a bias for LBGs of b\sim 1.5 (4.5) for q_0=0.1 (0.5), in
agreement with our previous estimates based on preliminary spectroscopy. The
strong clustering and the large bias of the LBGs are consistent with biased
galaxy formation theories and provide additional evidence that these systems
are associated with massive dark matter halos. The clustering of LBGs at z=3
emphasizes that apparent evolution of galaxy clustering may be due as much to
variations in effective bias parameter among different samples as to evolution
in the mass distribution through gravitational instability.

depend on $a$; for $a$ greater than an equilibrium spin parameter $a_{eq}$ the
black hole is de-spun by the accretion flow. We also investigate the dependence
of the flow on the angular momentum transport efficiency $\alpha$, the advected
fraction of the dissipated energy $f$, and the adiabatic index $\gamma$. We
find solutions for $-1 < a < 1$, $10^{-4} \le \alpha \le 0.44$, $0.01 \le f \le

regime (-1<Delta<=1) is studied both analytically and numerically. In our model
an impurity spin (S=1/2) is coupled to a single spin in the XXZ spin chain.
Perturbative renormalization-group (RG) analysis is performed for various
limiting cases to deduce low-energy fixed points. It is shown that in the
ground state the impurity spin is screened by forming a singlet with a spin in
the host XXZ chain. In the antiferromagnetic side (0<Delta<=1) the host chain
is cut into two semi-infinite chains by the singlet. In the ferromagnetic side
(-1<Delta<0), on the other hand, the host XXZ chain remains as a single chain
through ""healing"" of a weakened bond in the low-energy (long-distance) limit.
The density matrix renormalization group method is used to study the size
scaling of finite-size energy gaps and the power-law decay of correlation
functions in the ground state. The numerical results are in good agreement with
the predictions of the RG analysis. Low-temperature behaviors of specific heat
and susceptibility are also discussed.

Tensor formalism. Our approach can be applied to both dielectric and metallic
systems of frequency-dependent dielectric function; as well as to objects of
any size and geometrical properties in principle. We are particularly
interested in calculating forces on nanostructures. We find that a body reacts
to the EM field by minimising its energy, i.e. it is attracted (repelled) by
regions of lower (higher) EM energy. When travelling waves are involved, forces
can be additionally understood in terms of momentum exchange between the body
and its environment. However when evanescent waves dominate, the forces are
complicated, often become attractive and cannot be explained by means of real
momentum being exchanged. We study the EM forces induced by a laser beam on a
crysta! l of dielectric GaP spheres. We ob serve effects due to the lattice
structure, as well as due to single scattering from each sphere. In the former
case the two main features are a maximum momentum exchange when the frequency
lies within a band gap; and a multitude of force orientations when the Bragg
conditions for multiple outgoing waves are met. In the latter case the
radiation couples to the EM eigenmodes of isolated spheres (Mie resonances) and
very sharp attractive and repulsive forces occur. Depending on the intensity of
the incident radiation these forces can overcome all other interactions present
(gravitational, thermal and Van der Waals) and may provide the main mechanism
for formation of stable structures in colloidal systems.

automata giving the correct answer with smaller probabilities are more powerful
than reversible automata.

construct a 1-way QFA which is exponentially smaller than any equivalent
classical (even randomized) finite automaton. This construction may be useful
for design of other space-efficient quantum algorithms.
