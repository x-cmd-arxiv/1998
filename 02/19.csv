view is that the most massive galaxies were assembled early and have evolved
with steeply declining star formation rates since a redshift of 2 or higher.
According to hierarchical theories, massive galaxies were assembled much more
recently from mergers of smaller subunits. Here we present a simple
observational test designed to differentiate between the two. The observed
K-band flux from a galaxy is a good measure of its stellar mass even at high
redshift. It is probably only weakly affected by dust extinction. We compute
the evolution of the observed K-band luminosity function for traditional, pure
luminosity evolution (PLE) models and for hierarchical models. At z=0, both
models can fit the observed local K-band luminosity function. By redshift 1,
they differ greatly in the predicted abundance of bright galaxies. We calculate
the redshift distributions of K-band selected galaxies and compare these with
available data. We show that the number of K<19 galaxies with redshifts greater
than 1 is well below the numbers predicted by the PLE models. In the Songaila
et al (1994) redshift sample of 118 galaxies with 16<K<18, 33 galaxies are
predicted to lie at z>1. Only 2 are observed. In the Cowie et al. (1996)
redshift sample of 52 galaxies with 18<K<19, 28 galaxies are predicted to lie
at at z>1. Only 5 are observed. Both these samples are more than 90% complete.
We conclude that there is already strong evidence that the abundance of massive
galaxies at z=1 is well below the local value. This is inconsistent with the
traditional model, but similar to the expectations of hierarchical models.

galaxies (FBGs) has been a mystery for nearly two decades, and remains one of
the grand astronomical issues to date. Existing models cannot explain all of
the observational data such as galaxy number counts in the optical and infrared
passbands and the redshift distributions of galaxies. Here, by modelling the
morphological number counts derived from the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as
the number counts in optical and infrared passbands, and the redshift and color
distributions of galaxies obtained from ground-based observations, we show that
the `FBG problem' cannot be resolved if elliptical galaxies are assumed to have
formed in an instantaneous burst of star formation at high redshift with no
subsequent star formation events, which is just the conventional scenario for
formation and evolution of ellipticals. There exist great discrepancies between
the observed $B-K$ color distribution and the predicted distribution for
ellipticals by such a pure luminosity evolution (PLE) model in the context of
the conventional scenario. Neither can the mild evolution (i.e., the star
formation events have lasted for a longer time than those of the instantaneous
burst and passive evolution since the formation of galaxies) for ellipticals be
accepted in the context of PLE assumption. The introduction of dust extinction
also cannot save the PLE models. This conclusion holds for each of the three
cosmological models under consideration: flat, open and $\Lambda$-dominated.
Hence, our investigation suggests that PLE assumption for elliptical galaxies
is questionable, and number evolution may be essential for ellipticals.

rotation modifies the $\kappa$-mechanism excitation and observability of g-mode
oscillations. We find that, by affecting the timescale match between the mode
period and the thermal time at the driving zone, rapid rotation stabilizes some
of the g-modes that are excited in a non-rotating star, and, conversely,
excites g-modes that are damped in absence of rotation. The fluid velocities
and temperature perturbations are strongly concentrated near the equator for
most g-modes in rapidly rotating stars, which means that a favorable viewing
angle may be required to observe the pulsations. Moreover, the stability of
modes of the same $l$ but different $m$ is affected differently by rotation. We
illustrate this by considering g-modes in Slowly Pulsating B-type stars as a
function of the rotation rate.

Mpc/h as would be produced by a void of ~20% underdensity surrounded by a dense
shell. This shell roughly coincides with the local Great Walls. Monte Carlo
analyses, using Gaussian errors or bootstrap resampling, show the probability

indicating that the neutral gas is outflowing in these galaxies with velocities
up to 200 km/s.The rest of the sample shows broad damped Lyalpha absorption
profiles centered at the wavelength corresponding to the redshift of the H II

in these galaxies is the driving factor that determines the detectability of
Lyalpha in emission. Relatively small column densities of neutral gas with even
very small dust content would destroy the Lyalpha emission if this gas is
static with respect to the ionized region where Lyalpha photons originate. The
situation changes dramatically when most of the neutral gas is velocity-shifted
with respect to the ionized regions because resonant scattering by neutral
hydrogen will be most efficient at wavelengths shorter than the Lyalpha
emission, allowing the Lyalpha photons to escape (at least partially). This
mechanism complements the effect of porosity in the neutral interstellar medium
discussed by other authors. The anisotropy of these gas flows and their
dependence on the intrinsic properties of the violent star-forming episodes
might explain the apparent lack of correlation between metallicity and the
frequency of occurence and strength of Lyalpha emission in star-forming
galaxies. Attempts to derive the comoving star-formation rate at high redshifts

molecular crystals kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2X where X is an anion (e.g., X=I3,
Cu[N(CN)2]Br, Cu(SCN)2) are reviewed. These materials are particularly
interesting because of similarities to the high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors
including unconventional metallic properties and competition between
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. The temperature dependence of
electrical transport, optical, and nuclear magnetic resonance properties
deviate significantly from those of a conventional metal. In particular, there
appears to be an effective Fermi energy of the order of 100 K which is an order
of magnitude smaller than predicted by band structure calculations. The results
of quantum chemistry calculations suggest that a minimal theoretical model that
can describe these materials is a Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular
lattice with one electron per site. Appropriate parameter values for the model
imply that the electronic correlations are strong, significant magnetic
frustration is present, and the system is close to a metal-insulator
transition. Insight into the physics of this model can be obtained from recent
studies of the Hubbard model using a dynamical mean-field approximation. They
are consistent with a low effective Fermi energy and the unconventional
temperature dependence of many of the properties of the metallic phase. Future
directions are suggested for both theoretical and experimental studies.

Buchdahl's method to scalar-tensor theories and obtain theory-independent
inequalities. After discussing the mass definition in scalar-tensor theories,
these inequalities are related to a theory-dependent maximum mass-to-size
ratio. We show that its value can exceed not only Buchdahl's limit, 8/9, but
also unity, which we call {\it the black hole limit}, in contrast to general
relativity. Next, we numerically examine the validity of the assumptions made
in deriving the inequalities and the applicability of our analytic results. We
find that the assumptions are mostly satisfied and that the mass-to-size ratio
exceeds both Buchdahl's limit and the black hole limit. However, we also find
that this ratio never exceeds Buchdahl's limit when we impose the further
condition, $\rho-3p\ge0$, on the density, $\rho$, and pressure, $p$, of the

studied and found to be small for Q**2 > 1 (GeV/c)**2. Within experimental
precision the g2 data are well-described by the Wandzura-Wilczek twist-2
contribution. Twist-3 matrix elements were extracted and compared to
theoretical predictions. The asymmetry A2 was measured and found to be
significantly smaller than the positivity limit for both proton and deuteron
targets. A2 for the proton is found to be positive and inconsistent with zero.
Measurements of g1 in the resonance region show strong variations with x and
Q**2, consistent with resonant amplitudes extracted from unpolarized data.
These data allow us to study the Q**2 dependence of the first moments of g1

Particular attention is paid to the questions of how to arrange for sufficient
e-folds of inflation to occur, what kind of thermal history is expected after
the end of inflation, and how to implement successful baryogenesis. Such models
are argued to require a more restrictive symmetry structure than previously
thought. In particular, it is non-trivial that the decays of the fields driving
D-inflation can reheat the universe in such a way as to avoid the strong
gravitino production constraints. We also show how the initial conditions for
Affleck-Dine baryogenesis can arise in these models and that the simplest flat
directions along which baryon number is generated can often be ruled out by the
constraints coming from decoherence of the condensate in a hot environment. At
the end, we find that successful reheating and baryogenesis can take place in a
large subset of D-inflationary models.

synchrony at physiologically relevant frequencies (10-200 Hz) in a network of
heterogeneous inhibitory neurons. We focus on the factors that determine the
level of synchrony and frequency of the network response, as well as the
effects of mild heterogeneity on network dynamics. With mild heterogeneity,
synchrony is never perfect and is relatively fragile. In addition, the effects
of inhibition are more complex in mildly heterogeneous networks than in
homogeneous ones. In the former, synchrony is broken in two distinct ways,
depending on the ratio of the synaptic decay time to the period of repetitive
action potentials ($\tau_s/T$), where $T$ can be determined either from the
network or from a single, self-inhibiting neuron. With $\tau_s/T > 2$,
corresponding to large applied current, small synaptic strength or large
synaptic decay time, the effects of inhibition are largely tonic and
heterogeneous neurons spike relatively independently. With $\tau_s/T < 1$,
synchrony breaks when faster cells begin to suppress their less excitable
neighbors; cells that fire remain nearly synchronous. We show numerically that
the behavior of mildly heterogeneous networks can be related to the behavior of
single, self-inhibiting cells, which can be studied analytically.

known to be in a pure state there is an obvious answer, corresponding to the
unique unitarily-invariant measure on the Hilbert sphere. However, the problem
is open for the general case where states are described by density operators.
Here two approaches to the problem are investigated.
  The first approach assumes that the system is randomly correlated with a
second system, where the ensemble of composite systems is described by a random
pure state. Results for qubits randomly correlated with other systems are
presented, including average entanglement entropies. It is shown that maximum
correlation is guaranteed in the limit as one system becomes
infinite-dimensional.
  The second approach relies on choosing a metric on the space of density
operators, and generating a corresponding ensemble from the induced volume
element. Comparisons between the approaches are made for qubits, for which the
second approach (based on the Bures metric) yields the most symmetric, and
hence the least informative, ensemble of density operators.
