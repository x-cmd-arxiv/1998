observational constraints derived from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)

early-type galaxies can be explained by the pure luminosity evolution models,
without invoking exotic scenarios such as merging or introducing an additional
population. But the evolution should be nearly passive, with a high $z_f$
assumed. The conclusion is valid in all of the three cosmological models we
adopted in this paper. We also present the redshift distributions for three
bins of observed magnitudes in F814w pass-band, to show at which redshift are
the objects that dominate the counts at a given magnitude. The predictions of
the redshift distribution of $22.5<b_j<24.0$ are also presented for comparison

the inner region is few times shorter than the life time of the cluster, the
Thomson depth of the accumulated cold gas can be higher accordingly (if most of
the gas remains in the form of clouds). The illumination of the cold clouds by
the X-ray emission of the hot gas should lead to the appearance of a 6.4 keV
iron fluorescent line, with an equivalent width proportional to $\tau_T$. The
equivalent width only weakly depends on the detailed properties of the clouds,
e.g. on the column density of individual clouds, as long as the column density
is less than few $10^{23} cm^{-2}$. Another effect also associated exclusively
with the cold gas is a flux in the Compton shoulder of bright X-ray emission
lines. It also scales linearly with the Thomson optical depth of the cold gas.

the Kormendy relation, require the transformation from angular to metric sizes,
to compare the relation at different z values. This transformation depends on
the assumed world model: galaxies of a given angular size, at a given z, are
larger (in kpc) in a non-expanding universe than in an expanding one.
Furthermore, the luminosities of galaxies are expected to evolve with z in an
expanding model. These effects are shown to conspire to reduce the difference
between the predicted SB change with redshift in the expanding and non
expanding cases. We find that the predictions for the visible photometric bands
of the expanding models with passive luminosity evolution are very similar to
those of the static model till z about 1, and therefore, the test cannot
distinguish between the two world models. Recent good quality data are
consistent with the predictions from both models. In the K-band, where the
expected (model) luminosity evolutionary corrections are smaller, the
differences between the xpanding and static models amount to about 0.4 (0.8)
magnitudes at z = 0.4 (1). It is shown that, due to that small difference
between the predictions in the covered z-range, and to the paucity and
uncertainties of the relevant SB photometry, the existing K-band data is not
adequate to distinguish between the different world metrics, and cannot be yet
used to discard the static case. It is pointed out that the scaling relations
could still be used to rule out the non-evolving case if it could be shown that

therefore clarify the location of the lenses. A modest effort (2 hours per

Oph. This symbiotic binary consists of a 2-min accretion-powered pulsar and an
M5 III red giant. A strong He I 1.083 micron emission line with a pronounced P
Cygni profile was observed. From the blue edge of this feature, we infer an
outflow velocity of 250(50) km/s. This is an order of magnitude faster than a
typical red giant wind, and we suggest that radiation from the accretion disk
or the neutron star may contribute to the acceleration of the outflow. We infer
a wind mass loss rate of around 10^-6 Msun/yr. Accretion from such a strong
stellar wind provides a plausible alternative to Roche lobe overflow for
supplying the accretion disk which powers the X-ray source. The H I Paschen
beta and He I 1.083 micron lines showed no evidence for the dramatic changes
previously reported in some optical lines, and no evidence for pulsations at
the 2-min pulsar period.

consider the effects of frictional angular momentum loss (FAML), i.e.

calculations of CV evolution over a wide range of parameters demon- strate the
equivalence of a discontinuous sequence of nova cycles and the corresponding
mean evolution (replacing envelope ejection by a continuous wind), even close
to mass transfer instability. A formal stability analysis of discontinuous mass
transfer confirms this, independent of details of the FAML model. FAML is a
consequential angular momentum loss which amplifies the mass transfer rate
driven by systemic angular momentum losses such as magnetic braking. We show
that for a given v_exp and white dwarf mass the amplification increases with
secondary mass and is significant only close to the largest secondary mass
consistent with mass transfer stability. The amplification factor is
independent of the envelope mass ejected during the outburst, whereas the mass
transfer amplitude induced by individual nova outbursts is proportional to it.

highly compressible polytropic turbulence, based on a simple model and
one-dimensional numerical simulations. Observing that density structures tend
to form in a hierarchical manner, we assume that density fluctuations follow a
random multiplicative process. When the polytropic exponent $\gamma$ is equal
to unity, the local Mach number is independent of the density, and our
assumption leads us to expect that the probability density function (PDF) of
the density field is a lognormal. This isothermal case is found to be singular,
with a dispersion $\sigma_s^2$ which scales like the square turbulent Mach
number $\tilde M^2$, where $s\equiv \ln \rho$ and $\rho$ is the fluid density.
This leads to much higher fluctuations than those due to shock jump relations.
  Extrapolating the model to the case $\gamma \not =1$, we find that, as the
Mach number becomes large, the density PDF is expected to asymptotically
approach a power-law regime, at high densities when $\gamma<1$, and at low
densities when $\gamma>1$. This effect can be traced back to the fact that the
pressure term in the momentum equation varies exponentially with $s$, thus
opposing the growth of fluctuations on one side of the PDF, while being
negligible on the other side. This also causes the dispersion $\sigma_s^2$ to
grow more slowly than $\tilde M^2$ when $\gamma\not=1$. In view of these
results, we suggest that Burgers flow is a singular case not approached by the
high-$\tilde M$ limit, with a PDF that develops power laws on both sides.

mechanically is presented. The scheme combines a path integral description of
the nuclear variables with a first-principles adiabatic description of the
electronic structure. The electronic problem is solved for the ground state
within a density functional approach, with the electronic orbitals expanded in
a localized (Gaussian) basis set. The discretized path integral is computed by
a Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling technique on the normal modes of the
isomorphic ring-polymer. An effective short-time action correct to order
$\tau^4$ is used. The validity and performance of the method are tested in two
small Lithium clusters, namely Li$_4$ and Li$_5^+$. Structural and electronic
properties computed within this fully quantum-mechanical scheme are presented
and compared to those obtained within the classical nuclei approximation.
Quantum delocalization effects are significant but tunneling turns out to be
irrelevant at low temperatures.

viscosity $\eta$, and the equilibrium structural statistics of n-alkanes $(6
\le n \le 66)$ is studied numerically. For small n the chains are non-Gaussian
and the mean squared end-to-end distance $R^2$ is greater than $R_G^2$, where
$R_g^2$ is the mean squared radius of gyration. As n increases, $R^2/R_G^2 \to
6(1+b/n)$, where b depends on the interaction model. At constant density, the
Rouse model is used to extract the monomeric friction coefficient $\zeta$ and
the viscosity $\eta$ independently from the diffusion constant D and the
longest relaxation time $\tau_R$. $\zeta_D$ extracted from D is nearly
independent of chain length while $\zeta_\tau$ obtained from $\tau_R$ is much
larger than $\zeta_D$ for small n. The viscosity measured in a non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulation is closely approximated by the value of $\eta$
determined from $\tau_R$ while $\eta$ inferred from D is smaller for small n.
For $n\agt 60$, the two estimates for both $\zeta$ and $\eta$ agree as
predicted from the Rouse model. D calculated from three interaction models is
studied for increasing $n$ and compared to experimental data.
