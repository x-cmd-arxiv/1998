to model gravitational lenses. Since galaxies are usually observed to have
elliptical light distributions, mass distributions with elliptical density
contours offer more general and realistic lens models. They are difficult to
use, however, since previous studies have shown that the deflection angle (and
magnification) in this case can only be obtained by rather expensive numerical
integrations. We present a family of lens models for which the deflection can
be calculated to high relative accuracy (one part in 100000) with a greatly
reduced numerical effort, for small and large ellipticity alike. This makes it
easier to use these distributions for modelling individual lenses as well as
for applications requiring larger computing times, such as statistical lensing
studies. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the author (or

similar to that found in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) motivated us to
re-investigate the ultraviolet (UV) extinction found in the SMC. We have been
able to improve significantly on previous studies by carefully choosing pairs
of well matched reddened and unreddened stars. In addition, we benefited from
the improved S/N of the NEWSIPS IUE data and the larger sample of SMC stars now
available. Searching the IUE Final Archive, we found only four suitable
early-type stars that were significantly reddened and had well matched
comparison stars. The extinction for three of these stars is remarkably
similar. The curves are roughly linear with 1/lambda and have no measurable
2175 A bump. The fourth star has an extinction curve with a significant 2175 A
bump and weaker far-UV extinction. The dust along all four sightlines is
thought to be local to the SMC. There is no significant Galactic foreground
component. The first three stars lie in the SMC Bar and the line-of-sight for
each of them passes through regions of recent star formation. The fourth star
belongs to the SMC Wing and its line-of-sight passes though a much more
quiescent region. Thus, the behavior of the dust extinction in the SMC supports
a dependence of dust properties on star formation activity. However, other
environmental factors (such as galactic metallicity) must also be important.
Dust in the 30 Dor region of the LMC, where much more active star formation is
present, does not share the extreme extinction properties seen in SMC dust.

Three-dimensional modeling of the mass transfer gas dynamics makes it possible
to investigate gas streams in the system and to study the influence of a common
envelope. The presence of the common envelope leads to the absence of shock
interaction between the stream of matter flowing from the inner Lagrange point
and the gas in the accretion disk. The stream is deflected by the gas in the
common envelope and approaches the disk tangentially, so that it does not cause
any shock perturbation (""hot spot"") on the disk. At the same time, the
interaction of the stream with the common envelope leads to the formation of an
extended shock wave along the edge of the stream. The observational
manifestation of this shock is estimated to be equivalent to that of a hot spot
in the disk. The calculated accretion disk parameters are presented.

  in early Universe","RevTex, 5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat gr-qc hep-ph",,"  It is now well-recognized that the Universe may behave like a condensed
matter system in which several phase transitions have taken place.
Superconductors and the superfluid phases of 3He are condensed matter systems
with useful similarities to the Universe: they both contain Bose fields (order
parameter) and Fermions (quasiparticles) which interact in a way similar to the
interaction of Higgs and gauge particles with fermions in particle physics.
This analogy allows us to simulate many properties of the cosmologically
relevant physical (particle physics) vacuum in condensed matter, while direct
experiments in particle physics are still far from realization. Recently, the
anomalous generation of momentum (called ``momentogenesis'') was experimentally
confirmed in 3He: in the non-trivial background of a moving 3He vortex, quantum
effects gave rise to the production of quasiparticles with momentum which were
detected by measuring the force on the vortex. This phenomenon is based on the
same physics as the anomalous generation of matter in particle physics and
bears directly on the cosmological problem of why the Universe contains much
more matter than antimatter (``baryogenesis''). Here we report the experimental
observation of the effect opposite to momentogenesis: the conversion of
quasiparticle momentum into a non-trivial order parameter configuration or
``texture''. The corresponding process in a cosmological setting would be the
creation of a primordial magnetic field due to changes in the matter content.

  These results are much larger than previous estimates based on a work without

The constraints on the apex (rho-bar,eta-bar) of the unitarity triangle
obtained from these two CP-asymmetries define circles in the

contain some new QCD corrections enhancing Br(Delta S=1), which now exceeds
Br(Delta S=0) by roughly a factor of two.

the sensitivity of the predictions to the choice of the renormalization and

NLO corrections. Adopting the criteria according to which a NLO prediction is
considered reliable if, both, the ratio of the NLO to LO contributions and the
strong coupling constant are reasonably small, we find that reliable
perturbative predictions for the pion electromagnetic form factor with all
distribution amplitudes considered can already be made at a momentum transfer
Q<10 GeV, with corrections to the LO results being typically of the order of ~
20%. To check our predictions and to discriminate between the distribution

is locally trivial. We extend this and related results into the context of

dielectric film illuminated with laser light, electrons produced the
electron-diffraction pattern not only at a fluorescent target but also at a
nonfluorescent target. In the latter case the pattern was of the same color as
the laser light (the Schwarz-Hora effect). This effect was discussed
extensively in the early 1970s. However, since 1972 no reports on the results
of further attempts to repeat those experiments in other groups have appeared,
while the failures of the initial such attempts have been explained by Schwarz.
The analysis of the literature shows there are several unresolved up to now
contradictions between the theory and the Schwarz experiments. In this work we
consider the interpretation of the long-wavelength spatial beating of the
Schwarz-Hora radiation. A more accurate expression for the spatial period has
been obtained, taking into account the mode structure of the laser field within
the dielectric film. It is shown that the discrepancy of more than 10% between
the experimental and theoretical results for the spatial period cannot be
reduced by using the existing quantum models that consider a collimated
electron beam.
