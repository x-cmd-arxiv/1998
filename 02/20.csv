To study the problems in terms of dynamical systems theory, a scheme of
intra-inter dynamics is presented. It consists of internal dynamics of a unit,
interaction among the units, and the dynamics to change the dynamics itself,
for example by replication (and death) of units according to their internal
states. Applying the dynamics to cell differentiation, isologous
diversification theory is proposed. According to it, orbital instability leads
to diversified cell behaviors first. At the next stage, several cell types are
formed, first triggered by clustering of oscillations, and then as attracting
states of internal dynamics stabilized by the cell-to-cell interaction. At the
third stage, the differentiation is determined as a recursive state by cell
division. At the last stage, hierarchical differentiation proceeds, with the
emergence of stochastic rule for the differentiation to sub-groups, where
regulation of the probability for the differentiation provides the diversity
and stability of cell society. Relevance of the theory to cell biology is
discussed.

telescopes offer a unique view of the high-redshift universe with unprecedented
sensitivity. Recent sub-millimetre continuum studies show that the host
galaxies of many luminous high-redshift AGN (radio galaxies and radio-quiet
quasars) radiate strongly at rest-frame far-infrared wavelengths and thus
contain substantial quantities of dust. In the majority of these high-redshift
AGN-hosts, the inferred star formation is proceeding at a rate comparable to
that found in local, interacting ultra-luminous FIR galaxies. This level of
activity is an order of magnitude greater than the more modest star-formation
rates apparently displayed by the recently-discovered Lyman-limit galaxies at z
~ 3, which have been argued to represent the era of spheroid formation
(although the degree to which the effects of reddening by dust grains may have
biased the interpretation of these optical/UV studies of high-z galaxies has
yet to be properly determined). However, it is too early to say whether such
bright FIR emission is a feature of all massive galaxies at z > 3, or whether
it is in fact confined to the hosts of the most luminous AGN.
  In this paper we review the current status of cosmological observations at
sub-mm and mm wavelengths, highlighting our own recent SCUBA observations of
high-redshift radio galaxies. We also explain how observations over the next
few years should allow the true level of star-formation activity in the high-z
universe to be properly quantified, and we provide example predictions for the
first deep sub-millimetre survey (of the Hubble Deep Field), which we and our
colleagues are currently undertaking with SCUBA at the JCMT.

a massive body orbiting within the dark halo of a dwarf galaxy. This dark halo
is treated as the core region of a King distribution of dark matter particles,
in consistency with the observational result of dwarf galaxies having solid
body rotation curves. Thus we derive a simple formula which provides a reliable
and general first order solution to the problem, totally analogous to the one
corresponding to the dynamical friction problem in an isothermal halo. This
analytic approach allows a clear handling and a transparent understanding of
the physics and the scaling of the problem. A comparison with the isothermal
case shows that in the core regions of a King sphere, dynamical friction
proceeds at a different rate, and is sensitive to the total core radius. Thus,
in principle, observable consequences may result. In order to illustrate the
possible effects, we apply this formula to the spiraling of globular cluster
orbits in dwarf galaxies, and show how present day globular cluster systems
could in principle be used to derive better limits on the structure of dark
halos around dwarf galaxies, when the observational situation improves. As a
second application, we study the way a massive black hole population forming a
fraction of these dark halos would gradually concentrate towards the centre,
with the consequent deformation of an originally solid body rotation curve.
This effect allows us to set limits on the fraction/mass of any massive black
hole minority component of the dark halos of dwarf galaxies. In essence, we
take advantage of the way the global matter distribution fixes the local
distribution function for the dark matter particles, which in turn determines
the dynamical friction problem.

described by a single constant parameter, either k_L or k_D, depending whether
we refer to luminosity or density evolution. In this paper we present a study
of the variations of the evolution parameters with redshift, for different
cosmological models, in order to probe the differential evolution with
redshift. Two different quasar samples have been analyzed, the AAT Boyle's et
al. and the LBQS catalogues. Basically, these samples are divided in redshift
intervals and in each of them k_L and k_D are estimated by forcing that
<V/Vmax>=0.5. The dependence with respect to the cosmological parameters is
small. Both AAT and LBQS show roughly the same tendencies. LBQS, however, shows
strong fluctuations, whose origin is not statistical but rather due to the
selection criteria. A discussion on selection techniques, biases and binning
effects explains the differences between these results. We finally conclude
that the evolution parameter is almost constant in the redshift range 0.7 < z <
1.7, at least within 2 sigma, while it decreases slightly afterwards. Results
depend on the binning chosen (but not in a very significant way). The method
has been tested with Monte-Carlo simulated catalogues in order to give a better
understanding of the results coming from the real catalogues. A correlation
between k_L (k_D) and <V/Vmax> is also derived and is used for the calculation
of the error bars on the evolution parameter.

effects, deep redshift surveys should either be analyzed in conjunction with
CMBR data which determines the cosmological parameters, or by using a Bayesian
likelihood scheme in which varying cosmological parameters and a simple
parameterization of the primordial power spectrum are assumed as the priors, so
that observed data can be mapped from redshift to real space. The derived power

developed a localization algorithm that allows one to iteratively transform the
extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of
maximally localized Wannier functions. We apply this formalism here to the case

allows a meaningful band-by-band decomposition of the whole Bloch band complex.
In perovskites, these Wannier functions are centered on the atomic sites and
display clearly a s, p, d, or hybrid character. Second, since the centers of

are characterised as bound or unbound according to the scaling of the average
particle-hole separation with system size. We critically examine other criteria
commonly used to characterise states. The polymer is described by an extended
Hubbard model with alternating transfer integrals. The model is solved by exact
diagonalisation and the density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) method. We
demonstrate that the DMRG accurately determines excitation energies, transition
dipole moments and particle-hole separations of a number of dipole forbidden
(Ag) and dipole allowed (Bu) states.
  Within a parameter regime considered reasonable for polymers such as
polyacetylene, it is found that the charge gap, often used to define the
exciton binding energy, is not a good criterion by which to decide whether a
state is bound or unbound. The essential non-linear optical state mAg is found
to mark the onset of unbound excitations in the Ag symmetry sector. In the Bu
symmetry sector, on the other hand, it is found that all low lying states are
unbound and that there is no well defined nBu state. That is, the 1Bu state
marks the onset of unbound excitations in this sector.

k^{-1}>(eT)^{-1} is solved in hot scalar electrodynamics, with a view towards
understanding relaxational phenomena in the QGP and the electroweak plasma. We
find that transverse gauge invariant non-equilibrium expectation values of
fields relax via {\em power laws} to asymptotic amplitudes that are determined
by the quasiparticle poles. The long time relaxational dynamics and relevant
time scales are determined by the behaviour of the retarded self-energy not at
the small frequencies, but at the Landau damping thresholds. This explains the
presence of power laws and not of exponential decay. Furthermore, we derive the
influence functional, the Langevin equation and the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem for the soft modes, identifying the correlation functions that emerge
in the classical limit. We show that a Markovian approximation fails to
describe the dynamics {\em both} at short and long times. We also introduce a
novel kinetic approach that goes beyond the standard Boltzmann equation and
incorporates off-shell processes and find that the distribution function for
soft quasiparticles relaxes with a power law through Landau damping. We also
find an unusual dressing dynamics of bare particles and anomalous (logarithmic)
relaxation of hard quasiparticles.

the infrared enhanced behaviour of the gluon propagator with SD equations, the
running coupling constant is modified taking into account the minimality

studied. Then, it is proved that if we equip the GGA with a differential

is the basic tool to define an adapted superspace leading to the extension of
supersymmetry called fractional supersymmetry of order $F$ (FSUSY), $F=2$
corresponding to the usual supersymmetry. Local FSUSY in one dimension is then
contructed in the world-line formalism, and an extension of the Dirac equation
is obtained. In two dimensions, it turns out that FSUSY is a conformal field
theory and in addition to the stress energy tensor, a supercurrent of conformal
weight $1+1/F$, which generates a symmetry between the primary fields of
conformal weight $(0,1, \cdots, 1-1/F$), is obtained. The algebra is explicitly
constructed. We also show that in $1+2$ dimensions FSUSY is a non-trivial
extension of the Poincar\'e algebra which generates a symmetry among fractional
spin states or anyons. Unitarity of the representation is checked. Finally, we
prove that, independently of the dimension, a natural classification emerges
according to the decomposition of $F$ as a product of prime numbers and that
FSUSY is a symmetry which closes non-linearly, and is sustained by mathematical
structures that go beyond Lie or super-Lie algebras.

given, together with lowest order $\pi$ meson exchange and isobar currents as
well as meson production currents. A brief overview is given on the most
important one- and two-boson processes. Electron scattering in the one-boson-
approximation is then considered in greater detail. Formal expressions of the
cross section for inclusive and exclusive processes are given, including parity
violating contributions from $\gamma$-$Z$ interference as well as from parity
violating components in the hadronic wave function. Specific electromagnetic
reactions on the deuteron are then discussed with respect to the influence of
meson exchange currents, isobar configurations in the deuteron groundstate,
relativistic contributions and the role of $\pi$-meson retardation.
Furthermore, recent results on coherent and incoherent $\pi$- and
$\eta$-photoproduction are presented as well as a discussion of the
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule and the effect of a parity violating deuteron
component on inclusive electron scattering off the deuteron for quasifree
kinematics. The review closes with a summary and a brief outlook.

especially close to threshold. A theoretical simulation of the experimental
cusp effect at eta threshold leads to a characteristic distribution of poles on
the Riemann sheets. We find a pole located in the $4^{th}$ Riemann sheet that
up to now has not been discussed. It belongs to the cusp peak at eta threshold.
In addition we obtain the surprising result using the Lee model that the
resonance $S_{11}(1535)$ does not play a large role. The main features of the
experimental data can be reproduced without explicitly introducing this
resonance. Furthermore, we have also studied the reactions N($\gamma$, $\pi$)N

There is a wide variety of generalized theories and they are characterized
mainly by the introduction of additional parameters and/or longitudinal modes
of electromagnetism. The Majorana-Oppenheimer form of electrodynamics, the
Sachs' theory of Elementary Matter, the analysis of the action-at-a-distance

nonlinear evolution of a state of a quantum computer. They have explicitly used
the fact that nonlinear evolutions in Hilbert spaces do not conserve scalar
products of states, and applied a description of separated systems taken from
Weinberg's nonlinear quantum mechanics. On the other hand it is known that
violation of orthogonality combined with the Weinberg-type description
generates unphysical, arbitrarily fast influences between noninteracting
systems. It was not therefore clear whether the algorithm is fast because
arbitrarily fast unphysical effects are involved. In these notes I show that
this is not the case. I analyze both algorithms proposed by Abrams and Lloyd on
concrete, simple models of nonlinear evolution. The description I choose is
known to be free of the unphysical influences (therefore it is not the Weinberg
one). I show, in particular, that the correct local formalism allows even to
simplify the algorithm.
