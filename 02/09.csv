reddening affects almost all aspects of the optical astronomy. Recently
Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis published an all-sky reddening map based on the
COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA infrared sky surveys. Their map is intended to
supersede the older Burstein & Heiles reddening estimates. In this paper I test
this new reddening map by comparing the reddening values for a sample of 110
$|b|>5\deg$ Galactic globular clusters selected from compilation of Harris. I
find a good agreement for globular clusters with galactic latitude $|b|>20\deg$
and fair overall agreement for globular clusters with $20>|b|>5\deg$, but with
several significant deviations. I discuss four individual clusters with largest
deviations, NGC 6144, Terzan 3, NGC 6355 and IC 1276, in order to investigate
the reasons for these large deviations. It seems that the new reddening map
overestimates the reddening in some large extinction regions. However, with its
high spatial resolution the new reddening map can be used to estimate the
relative variation of the reddening on scales $\lesssim 10'$.

Assuming a standard candle luminosity, the computed brightness distribution is
consistent with the BATSE results if bursts at the peak flux threshold, P = 0.4
photons cm^{-2}/s, are located at a limiting redshift of 1.9 to 3.3.
Progenitors of the systems producing gamma-ray bursts at small redshift

these at high redshift (dim) reside mainly in elliptical galaxies. The location
of a burst may be up to a Mpc away from the host galaxy.

the practical merits and disadvantages of different approaches we provide a

fluctuations and particle production. This program requires the solution of a
self-consistent inhomogeneous problem to provide initial Cauchy data for the
inhomogeneous condensates and Green's functions. We provide a simple solvable
ansatz for such an initial value problem for the Sine-Gordon and phi^4 quantum
field theories in one spatial dimension. We compare exact known results of the
Sine Gordon model to this simple ansatz. We also study the linear sigma model
in the large N limit in three spatial dimensions as a microscopic model for
pion production in ultrarelativistic collisions. We provide a solvable self-
consistent ansatz for the initial value problem with cylindrical symmetry. For
this case we also obtain a closed set of local and renormalized update
