high energies (VHE, >10^14 eV) in astrophysical sources whose physical
properties are constrained by their variability, in particular jets in Active
Galactic Nuclei (blazars) and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). We discuss in detail the
various competing cooling processes for energetic protons, as well as the
cooling of pions and muons in the hadronic cascade, which impose limits on both
the efficiency of neutrino production and the maximum neutrino energy. If the
proton acceleration process is of the Fermi type, we can derive a model
independent upper limit on the neutrino energy from the observed properties of
any cosmic transient, which depends only on the assumed total energy of the
transient. For standard energetic constraints, we can rule out major
contributions above 10^19 eV from current models of both blazars and GRBs; and
in most models much stronger limits apply in order to produce measurable
neutrino fluxes. For GRBs, we show that the cooling of pions and muons in the
hadronic cascade imposes the strongest limit on the neutrino energy, leading to
cutoff energies of the electron and muon neutrino spectrum at the source
differing by about one order of magnitude. We also discuss the relation of
maximum cosmic ray energies to maximum neutrino energies and fluxes in GRBs,
and find that the production of both the highest energy cosmic rays and
observable neutrino fluxes at the same site can only be realized under extreme
conditions; a test implication of this joint scenario would be the existence of
strong fluxes of GRB correlated muon neutrinos up to ultra high energies,
>10^17 eV. Secondary particle cooling also leads to slightly revised estimates
for the neutrino fluxes from (non-transient) AGN cores.

through 1996 October show that the supernova (SN) has undergone a significant
change in its radio emission evolution, dropping by a factor of ~2 below the
flux density S \propto t^{-0.73} power-law decline with time t observed
earlier. However, although S at all observed frequencies has decreased
significantly, its current spectral index of \alpha= -0.42\pm0.15 (S \propto
\nu^{+\alpha}) is consistent with the previous spectral index of
\alpha=-0.60_{-0.07}^{+0.04}.
  It is suggested that this decrease in emission may be due to the SN shock
entering a new region of the circumstellar material which has a lower density
than that expected for a constant speed (w), constant mass-loss rate (Mdot)
wind from the progenitor. If such an interpretation is correct, the difference
in wind and shock speeds appears to indicate a significant evolution in the
mass-loss history of the SN progenitor ~10^4 years before explosion, with a
change in circumstellar density (\propto Mdot/w) occurring over a time span of
\lesssim 4 kyr. Such features could be explained in terms of a fast
``blue-loop'' evolutionary phase of a relatively massive pre-SN progenitor
star. If so, we may, for the first time, provide a stringent constraint on the
mass of the SN progenitor based solely on the SN's radio emission.

This spectrum, with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio per spectral
resolution element (> 30), spans the wavelength range from 0.837 microns to 5.0
microns. We identify a total of four different major methane absorption
features, including the fundamental band at 3.3 microns, at least four steam
bands, and two neutral cesium features. We confirm the recent detection of
carbon monoxide (CO) in excess of what is predicted by thermochemical
equilibrium calculations. Carbon is primarily involved in a chemical balance
between methane and CO at the temperatures and pressures present in the outer
parts of a brown dwarf. At lower temperatures, the balance favors methane,
while in the deeper, hotter regions, the reaction reverses to convert methane
into CO. The presence of CO in the observable part of the atmosphere is
therefore a sensitive indicator of vertical flows. The high signal-to-noise
ratio in the 1 to 2.5 microns region permits us to place constraints on the
quantity of dust in the atmosphere of the brown dwarf. We are unable to
reconcile the observed spectrum with synthetic spectra that include the
presences of dust. The presence of CO but lack of dust may be a clue to the
location of the boundaries of the outer convective region of the atmosphere:
The lack of dust may mean that it is not being conveyed into the photosphere by
convection, or that it exists in patchy clouds. If the dust is not in clouds,
but rather sits below the outer convective region, we estimate that the
boundary between outer convective and inner radiative layers is between 1250 K
and 1600 K, in agreement with recent models.

J0720.4-3125 is a slowly rotating, probably completely isolated neutron star.
The absence of an optical counterpart brighter than B = 26.1 seems incompatible
with a neutron star atmosphere having a chemical composition dominated by
Hydrogen or Helium. UBI photometry of field stars shows astonishingly little
interstellar reddening in the direction of the X-ray source. Together with the
small column density detected by the ROSAT PSPC, this suggests a mean particle
density in the range of n = 0.1 - 0.4 cm-3. Such average densities would imply
very low velocities relative to interstellar medium (Vrel < 10 km/s) if the
source were powered by accretion. These stringent constraints may be relaxed if
the neutron star is presently crossing a small size structure of higher density
or if the effective temperature of the heated atmosphere is overestimated by
the blackbody approximation. Alternatively, RX J0720.4-3125 could be a young
and highly magnetized cooling neutron star.

a broad red-shifted component remained reasonably constant while a narrower

Physically consistent fits are possible if the index xi of the power-law
emissivity changes from 0.7 (high phase) to 3.0 (low phase).
  The shape of the red-shifted component at low phase is crucial to the disk
model interpretation. We suggest that the actual shape may be a broad
redshifted Gaussian. Three lines of evidence support the interpretation of the
Fe Kalpha line as multicomponent, beyond the lack of correlation in the
response to continuum changes of the red and blue components in MCG -06-30-15.

bosons (which are electrons bound to zeros). We show how the charge of these

effective mass approximately. By deriving a hamiltonian description of the
composite fermions and bosons and their charge and current operators, we make
precise and reconcile many notions that have been associated with them.

of the neutral kaons in two pions. It is a fundamental quantity which has
justly attracted a great deal of theoretical as well as experimental work. Its
determination may answer the question of whether CP violation is present only
in the mass matrix of neutral kaons (the superweak scenario) or also at work
directly in the decays. After a brief historical summary, we discuss the
present and expected experimental sensitivities. In the light of these, we come
to the problem of estimating epsilon'/epsilon in the standard model. We review
the present (circa 1998) status of the theoretical predictions of
epsilon'/epsilon. The short-distance part of the computation is now known to
the next-to-leading order in QCD and QED and therefore well under control. On
the other hand, the evaluation of the hadronic matrix element of the relevant
operators is where most of the theoretical uncertainty still resides. We
analyze the results of the currently most developed calculations. The values of
the B_i parameters in the various approaches are discussed, together with the
allowed range of the relevant combination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
entries Im V_{td}V^*_{ts}. We conclude by summarizing and comparing all
up-to-date predictions of epsilon'/epsilon. Because of the intrinsic
uncertainties of the long-distance computations, values ranging from 10^{-4} to
a few times 10^{-3} can be accounted for in the standard model. Since this
range covers most of the present experimental uncertainty, it is unlikely that
new physics effects can be disentangled from the standard model prediction. For

Having constructed the gauge fixed light-front helicity operator, we introduce
quark and gluon orbital helicity distribution functions relevant for polarized
deep inelastic scattering as Fourier transform of the forward hadron matrix
elements of appropriate bilocal operators. The utility of these definitions is
illustrated with the calculation of anomalous dimensions in perturbation

helicity of a composite system in an arbitrary reference frame and contrast the

argue from this result, together with the assumption that `black hole

macrostate for a general (quantum gravitational) closed system is an
equivalence class of matter-gravity microstates with the same expectation
values for the matter degrees of freedom alone. Not only does this finally
answer the question `what is entropy?', but it also predicts the equality of
the thermodynamic entropy of a black hole with the matter and the gravity
entropy-like quantities derived from the Euclidean path integral. Furthermore
it gives us a clear glimpse of an ultimate synthesis of quantum theory and
gravity in which we see that (a) gravity acts as a universal environment, thus
predicting that, if the initial state of the universe is unentangled, its
entropy must go on increasing forever, (b) the gravitational field has degrees
of freedom, but no observables, thus enabling gravity to perform the trick of
providing an objective continual process of decoherence. All the above rests on
the validity of unitarity. The `information-loss puzzle' had raised doubts

polynomials by Nakayashiki and Yamada and by Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon.
Motivated by these works and by Kashiwara's theory of crystal bases we define a
statistic on paths yielding two novel classes of polynomials. One of these
provides a generalization of the Kostka polynomials while the other, which we
name the A$_{n-1}$ supernomial, is a $q$-deformation of the expansion
coefficients of products of Schur polynomials. Many well-known results for
Kostka polynomials are extended leading to representations of our polynomials
in terms of a charge statistic on Littlewood-Richardson tableaux and in terms
of fermionic configuration sums. Several identities for the generalized Kostka
polynomials and the A$_{n-1}$ supernomials are proven or conjectured. Finally,
a connection between the supernomials and Bailey's lemma is made.

formulated in three dimensions using an equal-time (ET) formalism. This
involves a systematic reduction of four-dimensional dynamics to a
three-dimensional form by integrating out the time components of relative
momenta. A conserved electromagnetic current is developed for the ET formalism.
It is shown that consistent truncations of the electromagnetic current and the
$NN$ interaction kernel may be made, order-by-order in the coupling constants,
such that appropriate Ward-Takahashi identities are satisfied. A meson-exchange
model of the $NN$ interaction is used to calculate deuteron vertex functions.
Calculations of electromagnetic form factors for elastic scattering of
electrons by deuterium are performed using an impulse-approximation current.
Negative-energy components of the deuteron's vertex function and retardation
effects in the meson-exchange interaction are found to have only minor effects
on the deuteron form factors.

thermal production rate of photons increases with reduced masses, and is
enhanced by an order of magnitude at T=160 MeV with $m_\rho=300$ MeV. Assuming
a hydrodynamic evolution, we estimate the effect of the reduced masses on

expansion in powers of momentum, which we demonstrate using an error analysis
introduced by Lepage. A clear graphical determination of the radius of
convergence for the momentum expansion is also obtained. We use these
techniques to compare cutoff regularization, two forms of dimensional
regularization, and the dibaryon approach, using a simple model for
illustration. The naturalness of the parameters and predictions for bound-state
energies are also shown.

exchange diagrams with single and double delta-isobar excitation contributing
to elastic NN-scattering. We find that virtual $\Delta$-excitation processes
(in the static limit) produce the correct amount of isoscalar central
attraction as needed in the peripheral partial waves with $L\geq 3$.
Furthermore we compute the two-loop diagrams involving the $\pi\pi$-interaction
(so-called correlated $2\pi$-exchange). Contrary to common believe these
processes lead to negligibly small and repulsive corrections to the
NN-potential. The exchange of vector mesons ($\rho, \omega$) turns out to be
important for the F-wave phase shifts above $T_{lab}=150$ MeV. Without
adjustable parameters we are able to reproduce the empirical NN phase shifts up
to 350 MeV for $L\geq 3$ and up to about (50--80) MeV for the D-waves. This is
therefore the characteristic window in which the NN-interaction is basically
governed by chiral symmetry. Not surprisingly, the lower partial waves require
non-perturbative methods and additional short-distance parametrizations of the
NN-dynamics.

and the possibility of producing maximally entangled multi-qubit states suggest
many applications in quantum communication.

(regular one-parameter) deformations for integrable lattice systems. Our
procedure is based on the integrable time discretizations and consists of three
steps. First, for a given system one finds a local discretization living in the
same hierarchy. Second, one considers this discretization as a particular
Cauchy problem for a certain 2-dimensional lattice equation, and then looks for
another meaningful Cauchy problems, which can be, in turn, interpreted as new
discrete time systems. Third, one has to identify integrable hierarchies to
which these new discrete time systems belong. These novel hierarchies are
called then ''relativistic'', the small time step $h$ playing the role of
inverse speed of light. We apply this procedure to the Toda lattice (and
recover the well-known relativistic Toda lattice), as well as to the Volterra
lattice and a certain Bogoyavlensky lattice, for which the ''relativistic''
deformations were not known previously.
