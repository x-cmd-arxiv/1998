  if not, please let us know!",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The recent discovery of two flux decrements in deep radio maps obtained by
the VLA and the Ryle Telescope can have powerful implications for the density
parameter of the Universe, $\Omo$. We outline these implications by modeling
the decrements as the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect from two clusters
assuming their properties are similar to those of the low redshift population.
In this case, the absence of any optical or X-ray counterparts argues that the
clusters must be at large redshifts. We highlight the difficulty this poses for
a critical cosmology by a comparison with a fiducial open model with $\Omo=0.2$
($\lamo=0$). Applying the phenomenological X-ray luminosity-temperature
relation needed to explain the EMSS cluster redshift distribution, as inferred
by Oukbir and Blanchard (1997), we convert the X-ray band upper limits to lower
limits on the clusters' redshifts. Comparison of the counts implied by these
two SZ detections with model predictions, for clusters with redshifts larger
than these lower limits, illustrates quantitatively the inability of the
critical cosmology to account for such high-redshift clusters. On the other
hand, the open model with $\Omo=0.2$ remains consistent with the existence of
the two objects; it possibly has, however, difficulties with current limits on
spectral distortions and temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave
background. The discussion demonstrates the value of SZ cluster searches for
testing cosmological models and theories of structure formation.

in giant elliptical galaxies. As an initial equilibrium state we choose the
hydrostatic gas recycling model (Kritsuk 1996). Non-equilibrium radiative
cooling, stellar mass loss, heating by type Ia supernovae, distributed mass
deposition, and thermal conductivity are included. Although the recycling model
reproduces the basic X-ray observables, it appears to be unstable with respect
to the development of inflow or outflow. In spherically symmetry the inflows
are subject to a central cooling catastrophe, while the outflows saturate in a
form of a subsonic galactic wind. Two-dimensional axisymmetric random velocity
perturbations of the equilibrium model trigger the onset of a cooling
catastrophe, which develops in an essentially non-spherical way. The
simulations show a patchy pattern of mass deposition and the formation of
hollow gas jets, which penetrate through the outflow down to the galaxy core.
The X-ray observables of such a hybrid gas flow mimic those of the equilibrium
recycling model, but the gas temperature exhibits a central depression. The
mass deposition rate M_dot consists of two contributions of similar size: (i) a
hydrostatic one resembling that of the equilibrium model, and (ii) a dynamical
one which is related to the jets and is more concentrated to the centre. For a
model galaxy, like NGC 4472, our 2D simulations predict M_dot = 2 M_sun/yr
within the cooling radius for the advanced non-linear stage of the instability.
We discuss the implications of these results to H_alpha nebulae and star
formation in cooling flow galaxies and emphasize the need for high-resolution
3D simulations.

are observed both during thermonuclear X-ray bursts and during intervals of

on the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in the

mention several of the difficulties encountered in applying the magnetospheric
beat-frequency model to the kilohertz QPOs. The most fully developed and
successful model is the sonic-point beat-frequency model. We describe the work
on this model in some detail. We then discuss observations that could help to
distinguish between models. We conclude by noting some of the ways in which
study of the kilohertz QPOs may advance our understanding of dense matter and

introduced by Maskawa and Yamawaki (MY). Following MY, we present canonical
formalism of DLCQ and the zero-mode constraint through which the zero mode can
actually be solved away in terms of other modes,thus establishing the trivial
vacuum. Due to this trivial vacuum, existence of the massless Nambu-Goldstone
(NG) boson coupled to the current is guaranteed by the non-conserved charge
such that Q |0> = 0 and dot{Q} ne 0. The SSB (NG phase) in DLCQ can be realized
on the trivial vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the NG
boson m_{pi} is introduced so that the NG-boson zero mode integrated over the
LF exhibits singular behavior sim 1/m_{pi}^2 in such a way that dot{Q} ne 0 in
the symmetric limit m_{pi} -> 0. We also demonstrate this realization more
explicitly in the linear sigma model where the role of zero-mode constraint is
clarified. We fur ther point out, in disagreement with Wilson et al., that for
SSB in the continuum LF theory, the trivial vacuum collapses due to the special
nature of the zero mode as the accumulating point P^+ -> 0, in sharp contrast
to DLCQ. Finally, we discuss the no-go theorem of Nakanishi and Yamawaki, which
forbids exact LF r estriction of the field theory. Thus DLCQ as well as any
other regularization on the exact LF has no Lorentz-invariant limit as the
theory itself, although the Lorentz-invariant limit can be realized on the
c-number quantity like S matrix which has no reference to the fixed LF.

its angular velocity (along its circular orbit around the magnetic field

rescaling of fields, treatment of total derivatives, hermiticity of the system
operator and choice of measure. Scalar, spinor and vector fields are taken as
the matter quantum fields and their explicit conformal anomalies in the
gravity-dilaton background are found. The cohomology analysis is done and some
new conformal invariants and trivial terms, involving the dilaton, are
obtained. The symmetry of the constant shift of the dilaton field plays an
important role. The general structure of the conformal anomaly is examined. It
is shown that the dilaton affects the conformal anomaly characteristically for
each case: 1)[Scalar] The dilaton changes the conformal anomaly only by a new
conformal invariant, $I_4$; 2)[Spinor] The dilaton does {\it not} change the
conformal anomaly; 3)[Vector] The dilaton changes the conformal anomaly by
three new (generalized) conformal invariants, $I_4,I_2,I_{1}$. We present some
new anomaly formulae which are useful for practical calculations. Finally, the
anomaly induced action is calculated for the dilatonic Wess-Zumino model. We
point out that the coefficient of the total derivative term in the conformal
anomaly for the 2D scalar coupled to a dilaton is ambiguous. This resolves the
disagreement between calculations in refs.\cite{ENO,NO,SI97,KLV} and the result

  Data Management and Workflow Management Systems","18 pages, 13 figures",,,"CMS NOTE 1997/104","physics.ins-det hep-ex",,"  At a time when many companies are under pressure to reduce ""times-to-market""
the management of product information from the early stages of design through
assembly to manufacture and production has become increasingly important.
Similarly in the construction of high energy physics devices the collection of
(often evolving) engineering data is central to the subsequent physics
analysis. Traditionally in industry design engineers have employed Engineering
Data Management Systems (also called Product Data Management Systems) to
coordinate and control access to documented versions of product designs.
However, these systems provide control only at the collaborative design level
and are seldom used beyond design. Workflow management systems, on the other
hand, are employed in industry to coordinate and support the more complex and
repeatable work processes of the production environment. Commercial workflow
products cannot support the highly dynamic activities found both in the design
stages of product development and in rapidly evolving workflow definitions. The
integration of Product Data Management with Workflow Management can provide
support for product development from initial CAD/CAM collaborative design
through to the support and optimisation of production workflow activities. This
paper investigates this integration and proposes a philosophy for the support
of product data throughout the full development and production lifecycle and
demonstrates its usefulness in the construction of CMS detectors.

  Densities-of-States for Thermodynamic Purposes. II","15 pages, LaTeX, 7 postscript figures. We retitle and slightly modify
  the paper. For Part I (the case of partially entangled spin-1/2 particles),
  see quant-ph/9711010",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat",,"  We derive explicit expressions for the volume elements of both the minimal
and maximal monotone metrics over the (n^{2} - 1)-dimensional convex set of n x
n density matrices for the cases n = 3 and 4. We make further progress for the
specific n = 3 maximal-monotone case, by taking the limit of a certain ratio of
integration results, obtained using an orthogonal set of eight coordinates. By
doing so, we find remarkably simple marginal probability distributions based on
the corresponding volume element, which we then use for thermodynamic purposes.
We, thus, find a spin-1 analogue of the Langevin function. In the fully general
n = 4 situation, however, we are impeded in making similar progress by the
inability to diagonalize a 3 x 3 Hermitian matrix and thereby obtain an
orthogonal set of coordinates to use in the requisite integrations.

The investigations we offer focus attention mainly on presenting explict
analytical solutions by means of relating these generalized equations to
relativistic 1+1 dimensional systems of scalar fields where topological
solutions are known to play a role. Emphasis is given on chiral solutions, that
is, on the possibility of finding solutions that travel with velocities
determined in terms of the parameters that identify the generalized equation,
with a definite sign.

completely integrable Hamiltonian systems from representations of coalgebras
with Casimir element is presented. In particular, this construction shows that
quantum deformations can be interpreted as generating structures for integrable
deformations of Hamiltonian systems with coalgebra symmetry. In order to
illustrate this general method, the $so(2,1)$ algebra and the oscillator
algebra $h_4$ are used to derive new classical integrable systems including a
generalization of Gaudin-Calogero systems and oscillator chains. Quantum
deformations are then used to obtain some explicit integrable deformations of
the previous long-range interacting systems and a (non-coboundary) deformation
of the $(1+1)$ Poincar\'e algebra is shown to provide a new
Ruijsenaars-Schneider-like Hamiltonian.
