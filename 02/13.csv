internal chemical reaction dynamics interact with each other and replicate. It
leads to spontaneous differentiation of cells and determination, as is
discussed in the isologous diversification. Following features of the
differentiation are obtained: (1)Hierarchical differentiation from a ``stem''
cell to other cell types, with the emergence of the interaction-dependent rules
for differentiation; (2)Global stability of an ensemble of cells consisting of
several cell types, that is sustained by the emergent, autonomous control on
the rate of differentiation; (3)Existence of several cell colonies with
different cell-type distributions. The results provide a novel viewpoint on the
origin of complex cell society, while relevance to some biological problems,
especially to the hemopoietic system, is also discussed.

several X-ray pulsars accreting matter via an accretion disk. In these

It has been noted previously that alternating prograde and retrograde disk
flows would explain many features of the torque reversals, although it has been
unclear how a stable retrograde disk could be formed. We suggest that the
reversals may be related to the disk at times being warped to such an extent
that the inner region becomes tilted by more than 90 degrees. This region would
thus become retrograde, leading to a negative torque. Accretion disk models can
show such behavior, if account is taken of a warping instability due to
irradiation. The resulting `flip-overs' of the inner parts of the disk can
reproduce most characteristics of the observations, although it remains unclear
what sets the timescale on which the phenomenon occurs. If this model were
correct, it would have a number of ramifications, for instance that in the
spin-down state the X-ray source would mostly be observed through the accretion
disk.

velocity distributions of gas in the NLR/ENLR of some active galaxies. It thus
seemed plausible that shocks may also energize the NLR. The observed emission
line ratios strongly favor photoionization as the heating source, but it is not
clear whether the ionizing radiation is generated in the NLR by ""photoionizing
shocks"" or whether it originates at the central continuum source. Here I point
out that shocks are highly inefficient in producing line emission. Shocks in
the NLR can convert at most 10^{-6} of the rest mass to ionizing radiation,
compared with a maximum conversion efficiency of ~0.1 for the central continuum
source. The required mass flow rate through shocks in the NLR is thus a few
orders of magnitude higher than the mass accretion rate required to power the
NLR by the central continuum source. Since gravity appears to dominate the NLR
cloud dynamics, shocks must lead to an inflow, and the implied high inflow
rates can be ruled out in most active galaxies. NLR dynamics driven by a
thermal wind or by some jet configurations may produce the mass flux through
shocks required for photoionizing shocks to be viable, but the mass flux inward
from the NLR must be kept ~100-1000 times smaller. Photoionizing shocks are a
viable mechanism in very low luminosity active galaxies if they are highly
sub-Eddington (<~10^{-4}) and if they convert mass to radiation with a very low
efficiency (<~10^{-4}).

good approximation to the loop corrections (next to leading orders), indicating
negligible tidal effects. Here, we derive predictions for the (smoothed)
cumulants of the velocity divergence field $\theta \equiv \nabla\cdot\vv$ for
an irrotational fluid in the SC model. By comparing with the exact analytic
results by Scoccimarro & Frieman (1996), it is shown that, at least for the
unsmoothed case, the loop corrections to the cumulants of $\theta$ are
dominated by tidal effects. However, most of the tidal contribution seems to
cancel out when computing the hierarchical ratios, $T_J = {<\theta^J>

give predictions for the cumulants of the density and velocity divergence
fields in non-flat spaces. In particular, we show the equivalence between the
spherically symmetric solution to the equations of motion in the SC model
(given in terms of the density) and that of the Lagrangian PT approach (in
terms of the displacement field). It is shown that the $\Omega$-dependence is
very weak for both cosmic fields even at one-loop (a 10% effect at most),

predict a change in the observed slope of the red sequence of ellipticals as a
function of redshift. This change occurs primarily because the metal-rich
galaxies become redder faster than the metal-poorer galaxies with increasing
age. This effect is most pronounced within ~ 4 Gyr of formation. Observations
of the change of the slope of the red sequence with redshift may thus be used
to constrain the formation epoch for galaxy clusters. We examine the red
sequence of cluster ellipticals using publicly available HST imaging data for a
set of six 0.75>z>0.2 clusters, and a sample of 44 Abell clusters at z<0.15
imaged with the KPNO 0.9 m. We compare the derived slopes of the red sequences

considerations of absolute color evolution and scatter in the red sequence.

have been a source of substantial systematic errors in the statistical parallax

we showed that the statistical parallax method is extremely robust and rather
insensitive to various systematic effects. The main potential problem with this
method would therefore arise from systematically bad observational inputs,
primarily radial velocities and proper motions. In that paper, we demonstrated
that the radial velocities have not been systematically misestimated. Here we
turn our attention to proper motions. We compare three different catalogs of
proper motions --- Lick, Hipparcos and the one compiled by Wan et al. (WMJ). We
find that the WMJ catalog is too heterogeneous to be a reliable source.
  We analyze the sample of 165 halo RR Lyrae stars with either Lick or
Hipparcos proper motions. For the stars with both Lick and Hipparcos proper
motions we use the weighted means of reported values. Various possible biases
are investigated through vigorous Monte Carlo simulations and we evaluate small
corrections due to Malmquist bias, anisotropic positions of the stars on the
sky, and non-Gaussian distribution of stellar velocities. The mean RR Lyrae
absolute magnitude is M_V = 0.74 +/- 0.12 at the mean metallicity of the sample

DIRBE, which extends far-infrared wavelength coverage to 240 um, so that we are
reliably sampling the emission of large, thermal-equilibrium grains that
dominate the dust mass. The H I data are from the combined Leiden-Dwingeloo and
Parkes 21-cm line surveys. Using the maps of excess infrared emission at 100,
140, and 240 um, we created an atlas and identified the coherent structures.
These infrared excess clouds can be caused both by dust that is warmer than
average, or by dust associated with gas other than the atomic interstellar
medium. We find very few warm clouds, such as the H II region around Spica. The
majority of the infrared excess clouds are colder than the average atomic
interstellar medium. These clouds are peaks of column density, and their excess
infrared emission is due to dust associated with molecular gas. We identify
essentially all known high-latitude molecular clouds in the infrared excess
maps, and further identify a sample of new clouds with similar infrared
properties. The infrared excess was correlated with CO line brightness,
allowing us to measure the ratio of N(H2)/W(CO) for high-latitude clouds. The
atlas of infrared excess may be a useful guide to regions of relatively high
column density, which might cause high extinction toward extragalactic objects
at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths and confusion for cosmic infrared and
microwave backgrounds.

offers a powerful cosmological probe, because the predicted flow field is
proportional to the parameter Omega^{0.6}/b, where Omega is the matter density
and b is the bias of the galaxy distribution. The more densely sampled ORS
gravity field, to excellent approximation, matches that of the earlier IRAS
1.2-Jy redshift survey (Fisher et al. 1995), provided beta is reduced by a
factor b(opt)/b(IRAS)=1.4. Apart from this scaling, the most significant
difference between the ORS and IRAS fields is induced by differing estimates of
the over-density of the Virgo cluster. Neither of these gravity fields is
consistent with the peculiar velocity field constructed from the full Mark III

some important consequences for the resulting X-ray absorption spectra of AGN.
Pronounced effects of the presence of dust in warm material are (i) an apparent
flattening of the observed X-ray spectrum in the ROSAT band due to a sequence
of absorption edges and a shift to lower gas ionization, (ii) the presence of a
strong carbon edge at 0.28 keV, and (iii) the expectation of increased time
variability of the warm absorber parameters. The first two effects can be
drastic and may completely hamper an X-ray spectral fit with a dusty warm
absorber even if a dust-free one was successfully applied to the data. In order
to demonstrate facets of the dusty warm absorber model and test the recently
reported important, albeit indirect, evidence for dusty warm material in the
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 17020+4544 we have analyzed ROSAT PSPC and
HRI observations of this galaxy. The X-ray spectrum can be successfully
described by a single powerlaw with index Gamma_x = -2.4 plus small excess cold
absorption, or alternatively by a steeper intrinsic powerlaw (G_x = -2.8)
absorbed by a dusty warm absorber. The findings are discussed in light of the
NLSy1 character of IRAS 17020 and consequences for NLSy1s in general are
pointed out. In particular, the presence of dusty warm gas results in a steeper
intrinsic powerlaw than observed, thus exaggerating the `FeII problem'. It also
implies weaker potential warm-absorber contribution to high-ionization Fe
coronal lines.

supernovae, various stages of the explosion are described in terms of the
burning regimes of the thermonuclear flame front. In the early flamelet regime
following the ``smoldering'' phase prior to the explosion, the flame is
sufficiently thin and fast to remain laminar on small scales. As the white
dwarf density declines, the thermal flame structure becomes subject to
penetration by turbulent eddies, and it enters the ``distributed burning''
regime. A specific control parameter for this transition is proposed.
Furthermore, we outline an argument for the coincidence of the transition
between burning regimes with the onset of a deflagration-detonation-transition
(DDT) in the late phase of the explosion.

parameter that does not preserve the dynamics in the invariant subspace but is
otherwise generic, in a smooth dynamical system. We refer to such a parameter
as ``non-normal''. If there is chaos in the invariant subspace that is not
structurally stable, this has the effect of ``blurring out'' blowout
bifurcations over a range of parameter values that we show can have positive
measure in parameter space.
  Associated with such blowout bifurcations are bifurcations to attractors
displaying a new type of intermittency that is phenomenologically similar to
on-off intermittency, but where the intersection of the attractor by the
invariant subspace is larger than a minimal attractor. The presence of distinct
repelling and attracting invariant sets leads us to refer to this as ``in-out''
intermittency. Such behaviour cannot appear in systems where the transverse
dynamics is a skew product over the system on the invariant subspace.
  We characterise in-out intermittency in terms of its structure in phase space
and in terms of invariants of the dynamics obtained from a Markov model of the
attractor. This model predicts a scaling of the length of laminar phases that
is similar to that for on-off intermittency but which has some differences.

random external potential possesses a simple critical point which describes the
proliferation of disorder-induced topological defects in the superfluid ground
state, and which is located at weak disorder close to and above one dimension.
This makes it possible to address the critical behavior at the superfluid-Bose
glass transition in dirty boson systems by expanding around the lower critical
dimension d=1. Within the formulated renormalization procedure near d=1 the
dynamical critical exponent is obtained exactly and the correlation length
exponent is calculated as a Laurent series in the parameter \sqrt{\epsilon},
with \epsilon=d-1: z=d, \nu=1/\sqrt{3\epsilon} for the short range, and z=1,
\nu=\sqrt{2/3\epsilon}, for the long-range Coulomb interaction between bosons.
The identified critical point should be stable against the residual
perturbations in the effective action for the superfluid, at least in
dimensions 1\leq d \leq 2, for both short-range and Coulomb interactions. For
the superfluid-Mott insulator transition in the system in a periodic potential
and at a commensurate density of bosons I find \nu=(1/2\sqrt{\epsilon})+
1/4+O(\sqrt{\epsilon}), which yields a result reasonably close to the known XY
critical exponent in d=2+1. The critical behavior of the superfluid density,
phonon velocity and the compressibility in the system with the short-range
interactions is discussed.

modulated by torsions. Next, ring torsional disorder effects simulated by the

inherent to the (non-)equilibrium real time Green's function description (or

quantum field to an exemplaric heat bath with some given temperature T. It will
be shown in detail that the emerging transport equations have to be understood
as the ensemble average over stochastic equations of Langevin type. This
corresponds to the equivalence of the influence functional approach by Feynman
and Vernon and the CTP technique. The former, however, gives a more intuitive
physical picture. In particular the physical role of (quantum) noise and the
connection of its correlation kernel to the Kadanoff-Baym equations will be
discussed. The inherent presence of noise and dissipation related by the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem guarantees that the modes or particles become
thermally populated on average in the long-time limit. For long wavelength
modes with momenta much less than the temperature the emerging wave equation do
behave nearly as classical. On the other hand, a kinetic transport description
can be obtained in the semi-classical particle regime. Including fluctuations,
its form resembles that of a phenomenological Boltzmann-Langevin description.
However, we will point out some severe discrepancies in comparison to the
Boltzmann- Langevin scheme. As a further byproduct we also note how the
occurrence of so called pinch singularities is circumvented by a clear physical
necessity of damping within the one-particle propagator.

of stationary systems containing atoms in spatially inhomogeneous external
electric fields. In this context the subtle interplay of P-violation and time
reversal (T) invariance plays an important role. If the entire field
configuration is chosen to exhibit chirality the energies are in general
shifted by pseudoscalar contributions which change sign under a planar
reflection of the field. To calculate the effects we use the standard model of
elementary particle physics where the P-odd interaction arises through the
exchange of Z-bosons between the quarks in the nucleus and the atomic
electrons. We consider in detail hydrogen-like systems in unstable levels of
principal quantum number n=2. The nominal order of P-violating effects is
10^-5...10^-9 Hz which is determined by the mixing of the 2S_1/2 and 2P_1/2
states. However we point out that it is possible to enhance the P-violating
energy shifts dramatically! Instead of energy shifts linear in the P-violation
parameters we get then shifts proportional to the square root of these
parameters. Numerically we find such energy shifts to be of order 10^-5...1 Hz.
Application of our technique to hydrogen-like atoms with a nucleus of spin
I=1/2 yields P-violating energy shifts which are very sensitive to the nuclear
spin dependent P-odd force, which receives a rather large contribution from the
polarized strange quark density in polarized nuclei. Thus, a measurement of
these energy shifts could provide an important tool to elucidate nuclear
properties connected to the so called ``spin crisis''. We also present a method
for treating degenerate perturbation theory which combines advantages of both,
Kato's and Bloch's methods.

temperature (of initial and final states) Green functions. Two possible
boundary conditions are considered. One of them is usual in a field theory
vacuum boundary condition. Corresponding generating functional of Wigner
functions can be used in the particle physics. Another type of the boundary
condition assumes that the system under consideration is in environment of the
black-body radiation. This leads to the usual in statistics
Kubo-Martin-Schwinger boundary condition at the equilibrium (one-temperature)

finite-temperature field theory and with nonstationary statistical operator
approach of Zubarev are considered. The range of applicability of the

on the bifurcation line ($l=\infty$) of the problem. In our terms the H-atom
problem is exactly quasiclassical and is completely integrable by this reasons.

multiplets of the N=2 effective low-energy heterotic strings is calculated
directly in N=1 six-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the heterotic

the N=2 vector multiplet prepotential for compactifications of the heterotic
string for any rank three and four models, as well for compactifications on
$K_3 \times T^2$. In addition, we complete previous calculations, derived from
string amplitudes, by deriving the differential equation for the third
derivative of the prepotential with respect of the usual complex structure U
moduli of the $T^2$ torus. Moreover, we calculate the one loop prepotential,
using its modular properties, for N=2 compactifications of the heterotic string
exhibiting modular groups similar with those appearing in N=2 sectors of N=1
orbifolds based on non-decomposable torus lattices and on N=2 supersymmetric

number of a smooth map of a closed manifold. Applied to the identity map, this
formula reduces to the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The formula is computed
explicitly for constant curvature metrics. There is in fact a one-parameter
family of integral expressions. As the parameter goes to infinity, a
topological version of the heat equation proof of the Lefschetz fixed
submanifold formula is obtained. As the parameter goes to zero and under a
transversality assumption, a lower bound for the number of points mapped into
their cut locus is obtained. For diffeomorphisms with Lefschetz number unequal
to the Euler characteristic, this number is infinite for most metrics, in
particular for metrics of non-positive curvature.

e.g. homogeneous spaces and their compactifications.
  As another appplication of equivariant intersection theory, we obtain simple
versions of criteria for smoothness or rational smoothness of Schubert

demonstrate the importance of regularization of pi-N scattering amplitudes
involving Delta isobars and derivative meson-nucleon couplings, as this model
always yields finite amplitudes without recourse to phenomenological form
factors. We find an empirical scaling relation of the meson self interaction
coupling constants consistent with that previously found in the study of NN
scattering. Finally, we demonstrate that the OSBEP model does not contradict
