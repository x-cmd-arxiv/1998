function (IMF) claim a value of m(upper)=50+/-10 solar masses, based upon
direct comparisons of the observed oxygen and iron abundances in metal-poor
stars with the predicted stellar yields from Type II supernovae (SNe). An
unappreciated uncertainty in these analyses is the input physics intrinsic to
each SNe grid, and its effect upon stellar nucleosynthesis. We demonstrate how
such uncertainties, coupled with the uncertain metal-poor halo star
normalization, while allowing us to set a lower bound to m(upper) of
approximately 40 solar masses, nullifies any attempt at constraining the upper
bound.

the morphological data of Odewahn et al. (1996) for all galaxies with I < 26.0
detected in the Hubble Deep Field. From this combined catalog we generate the
morphological galaxy number-counts and corresponding redshift distributions and
compare these to the predictions of high normalization zero- and passive-
evolution models. From this comparison we conclude the following: (1) E/S0s are
seen in numbers and over a redshift range consistent with zero- or minimal
passive- evolution to I = 24. Beyond this limit fewer E/S0s are observed than
predicted implying a net negative evolutionary process --- luminosity dimming,
disassembly or masking by dust --- at I > 24. (2) Spiral galaxies are present
in numbers consistent with zero- evolution predictions to I = 22. Beyond this
magnitude some net- positive evolution is required. Although the number-counts
are consistent with the passive-evolution predictions to I=26.0 the redshift
distributions favor number AND luminosity evolution. (3) There is no obvious
explanation for the late-type/irregular class and this category requires
further subdivision. While a small fraction of the population lies at low
redshift (i.e. true irregulars), the majority lie at redshifts, 1 < z < 3. At z
> 1.5 mergers are frequent and, taken in conjunction with the absence of normal
spirals at z > 2, the logical inference is that they represent the progenitors
of normal spirals forming via hierarchical merging.

approximately 5-10% in the region where the cross section is large and could
therefore be measured in the next round of experiments. At the LHC the

latter have an ingoing nucleon with a variable momentum Q incident on the
daughter nucleus as a target, with as many outgoing channels as desirable. The
Dirac Eqs. for the electron part of the wave function acquire inhomogeneous
terms, and require the use of distorted electron Green's functions for their

appropriate momentum Q_k for the outgoing nucleon, which corresponds to the
electron momentum k through energy conservation, is achieved through the use of
the steepest descent saddle point method, commonly used in three-body
