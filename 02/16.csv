observations of the cosmic background radiation and large-scale structure, then
one might hope to reconstruct a unique single-field inflaton potential capable
of generating the observed spectra. In this paper we examine conditions under
which such a potential can be reliably reconstructed. For it to be possible at
all, the spectra must be well fit by a Taylor series expansion. A complete
reconstruction requires a statistically-significant tensor mode to be measured
in the microwave background. We find that the observational uncertainties
dominate the theoretical error from use of the slow-roll approximation, and
conclude that the reconstruction procedure will never insidiously lead to an
irrelevant potential.

Virgo Cluster and isolated spiral galaxies. For isolated spirals, there is a
good correlation between these two parameters and assigned Hubble types. In the
Virgo Cluster, the correlation between central light concentration and star
formation activity is significantly weaker. Virgo Cluster spirals have
systematically reduced global star formation with respect to isolated spirals,
with severe reduction in the outer disk, but normal or enhanced activity in the
inner disk. Assigned Hubble types are thus inadequate to describe the range in
morphologies of bright Virgo Cluster spirals. In particular, spirals with
reduced global star formation activity are often assigned misleading early-type
classifications, irrespective of their central light concentrations. 45+-25% of
the galaxies classified as Sa in the Virgo Cluster sample have central light
concentrations more characteristic of isolated Sb-Sc galaxies. The misleading
classification of low concentration galaxies with low star formation rates as
early-type spirals may account for part of the excess of `early-type' spiral
galaxies in clusters. Thus the morphology-density relationship is not all due
to a systematic increase in the bulge-to-disk ratio with environmental density.

that there is no possible self-consistent solution to the present existence of
the Sagittarius dwarf if its distribution of luminous matter traces the
underlying distribution of mass. The luminous component of the dwarf galaxy
must therefore be shielded within a small dark matter halo. Though at present
we are unable to construct a fully self-consistent model that includes both the

that a pure dark matter model, approximating the dark matter halo deduced for
the Sagittarius dwarf from analytical arguments, may indeed survive the

  The orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy around the Milky Way is considered,
taking into account the perturbative effects of the Magellanic Clouds. It is
shown that at the present time, the orbital period must be short, ~ 0.7 Gyr;
the initial orbital period for a 10^9 Solar mass model will have been ~ 1 Gyr.

emerged through a neutral column of N_H ~ 2.5 x 10^{25}/m^2, possibly located
within the AGN narrow-line region as argued in several high redshift

implies an an extreme density (n_e ~ 10^{17}/m^3) more typical of broad line
region clouds. However, we attribute this instead to the damping wings of Ly
beta from the resonant absorption. (iii) A tentative detection of HeII 1086

quadrupole moment of the system with the tidal field of the matter of the
neighbouring proto-clusters. We show that within high-density environments,
such as rich clusters of galaxies, tidal torques slow down the collapse of low
\nu peaks producing an observable variation in the time of collapse of the
shell and, as a consequence, a reduction in the mass bound to the collapsed
perturbation. Moreover, the delay of the collapse produces a tendency for less
dense regions to accrete less mass, with respect to a classical spherical
model, inducing a biasing of over-dense regions toward higher mass. Finally we
calculate the bias coefficient using a selection function properly defined
showing that for a Standard Cold Dark Matter (SCDM) model this bias can account
for a substantial part of the total bias required by observations on cluster
scales.

ordered regions of localized spins being gradually destroyed as the coupling to
the conduction electrons is reduced. For incommensurate conduction band
filling, the low-energy properties of the localized spins near the transition
are dominated by anomalous ordered (disordered) regions of localized spins
which survive into the paramagnetic (ferromagnetic) phase. Many interesting
properties follow, including a diverging susceptibility for a finite range of
couplings into the paramagnetic phase. Our critical line equation, together
with numerically determined transition points, are used to determine the range

Certainly, the ground state of this system is a spin liquid, but its properties
are rather unusual. The magnetic ($\Delta S=1$) excitations are separated from
the ground state by a gap. However, this gap is filled with nonmagnetic
($\Delta S=0$) excitations. In the thermodynamic limit the spectrum of these
nonmagnetic excitations will presumably develop into a gapless continuum
adjacent to the ground state. Surprisingly, the eigenstates of samples with an
odd number of sites, i.e. samples with an unsaturated spin, exhibit symmetries
which could support long range chiral order. We do not know if these states
will be true thermodynamic states or only metastable ones. In any case, the low
energy properties of the spin 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom\'e
lattice clearly distinguish this system from either a short range RVB spin
liquid or a standard chiral spin liquid. Presumably they are facets of a
generically new state of frustrated two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets.

approximation, using quark model, $\xi = 1 / N_c$ as a free parameter. It is
shown that the experimental branching ratio for $\Lambda_b \longrightarrow
\Lambda {J/\psi}$ restricts $\xi$ and this ratio can be understood for a value
of $\xi$ which lies in the range $ 0 \leq \xi \leq 0.5 $ suggested by two body
B meson decays. The branching ratios for $\Lambda_b \longrightarrow \Lambda_{c}
D^*_s(D_s) $ are predicted to be larger than the previous estimates. Finally it
is pointed that CKM-Wolfenstein parameter $\rho^2 + \eta^2$, where $\eta$ is CP
phase, can be determined from the ratio of widths of $\Lambda_b \longrightarrow
\Lambda \bar{D}$ and $\Lambda_b \longrightarrow \Lambda {J/\psi}$ or that of
$\Lambda_b \longrightarrow p D_s$ and $\Lambda_b \longrightarrow \Lambda_c D_s$
