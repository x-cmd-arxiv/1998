select a reliable sample from the the FIRST catalogue, paying particular
attention to the problem of how to define single radio sources from the
multiple components listed. We also consider the incompleteness of the
catalogue. We estimate the angular two-point correlation function $w(\theta)$,
the variance $\Psi_2$, and skewness $\Psi_3$ of the distribution for the
various sub-samples chosen on different criteria. Both $w(\theta)$ and $\Psi_2$
show power-law behaviour with an amplitude corresponding a spatial correlation
length of $r_0 \sim 10 h^{-1}$Mpc. We detect significant skewness in the
distribution, the first such detection in radio surveys. This skewness is found
to be related to the variance through $\Psi_3=S_3(\Psi_2)^{\alpha}$, with
$\alpha=1.9\pm 0.1$, consistent with the non-linear gravitational growth of
perturbations from primordial Gaussian initial conditions. We show that the
amplitude of variance and skewness are consistent with realistic models of
galaxy clustering.

demonstrating conclusively that this component cannot be emitted by the white
dwarf. Instead I show that its spectrum and luminosity are consistent with
coronal emission from the tidally spun-up K star. The star is more active than
other K stars in the Hyades, but equally active as K stars in the Pleiades with
the same rotation periods, demonstrating that rotation--and not age--is the key
parameter in determining the level of stellar activity.
  The soft X-ray emission (<0.4keV) is emitted predominately by the white dwarf
and is modulated on its spin period. I find that the pulse-profile is stable on
timescales of hours and years, supporting the idea that it is caused by opacity
of accreted material. The profile itself shows that the magnetic field
configuration of the white dwarf is dipolar and that the magnetic axis passes
through the centre of the star.
  There is an absorption feature in the lightcurve of the white dwarf, which
occurs at a time when our line-of-sight passes within a stellar radius of the K
star. The column density and duration of this feature imply a volume and mass
for the absorber which are similiar to those of coronal mass ejections of the

and polarization with period $\sim 1.66$ years, and for another signal that
dominates activity in the 1980s with period $\sim 1.12$ years. The relationship
between these two variations can be understood in terms of a `shock-in-jet'
model, in which the longer time scale periodicity is associated with an
otherwise quiescent jet, and the shorter time scale activity is associated with
the passage of a shock; the different periodicities of these two components may
reflect different internal conditions of the two flow domains, leading to
different wave speeds, or different contractions of a single underlying
periodicity, due to the different Doppler factors of the two flow components.
We suggest that the modulation arises from a wave driven by some asymmetric
disturbance close to the central engine. The periodic behavior in polarization
exhibits excursions in $U$ which correspond to a direction $\sim 45^{\circ}$
from the VLBI jet axis. This behavior is not explained by the random walk in
the $Q$-$U$ plane which is expected from models in which a pattern of randomly
aligned magnetic field elements propagate across the visible portion of the
flow, and suggests a small amplitude, cyclic variation in the flow direction in
that part of the flow that dominates cm-wavelength emission.

cold, oblique C-type shocks in dense molecular gas. Gas pressure, the inertia
of the charged components, and changes in ionisation are neglected. The grain
charge and rate coefficients for electron-neutral and grain-neutral elastic
scattering are assumed constant at values appropriate to the shock interior. An
MRN size distribution is accounted for by estimating an effective grain
abundance and Hall parameter for single-size grains.
  A one-parameter family of intermediate shocks exists for each shock speed v_s
between the intermediate signal speed v_A cos theta and sqrt{2} v_A cot theta,
where v_A is the preshock Alfven speed and theta is the angle between the
preshock magnetic field and the normal to the shock front. In addition, there
is a unique fast shock for each v_s > v_A.
  If the preshock density n_H is greater than about 10^5 cm^-3 and the preshock
magnetic field satisfies B(mG) less than about n_H(10^5 cm^-3) grains are
partially decoupled from the magnetic field and the field and velocity
components within fast shocks do not lie in the plane containing the preshock
field and the shock normal. The resulting shock structure is significantly
thinner than in models that do not take this into account. Existing models
systematically underestimate the grain-neutral drift speed and the heating rate
within the shock front. At densities in excess of 10^8 cm^-3 these effects may
be reduced by the nearly-equal abundances of positive and negative grains.

allowed us to study exhaustively the stability and conformational structure of

extended coil, the homogeneous globule, the micro-phase separated globule, and
a large number of frustrated states, which result in conformational phases of
the random coil and the frozen globule. We have also found that for a certain

masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this
correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on
