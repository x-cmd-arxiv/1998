Scott Gaudi, Andrew Gould","Spectrophotometric Resolution of Stellar Atmospheres with Microlensing","20 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/306867","OSU-TA-2/98","astro-ph",,"  Microlensing is a powerful tool for studying stellar atmospheres because as
the source crosses regions of formally infinite magnification (caustics) the
surfaceof the star is resolved, thereby allowing one to measure the radial
intensity profile, both photometrically and spectroscopically. However, caustic
crossing events are relatively rare, and monitoring them requires intensive
application of telescope resources. It is therefore essential that the
observational parameters needed to accurately measure the intensity profile are
quantified. We calculate the expected errors in the recovered radial intensity
profile as a function of the unlensed flux, source radius, spatial resolution
the recovered intensity profile, and caustic crossing time for the two
principle types of caustics: point-mass and binary lenses. We demonstrate that
for both cases there exist simple scaling relations between these parameters
and the resultant errors. We find that the error as a function of the spatial
resolution of the recovered profile, parameterized by the number of radial
bins, increases as $N_R^{3/2}$, considerably faster than the naive $N_R^{1/2}$
expectation. Finally, we discuss the relative advantages of binary
caustic-crossing events and point-lens events. Binary events are more common,
easier to plan for, and provide more homogeneous information about the stellar
atmosphere. However, a sub-class of point-mass events with low impact
parameters can provide dramatically more information provided that they can be
recognized in time to initiate observations.

  I: smooth lensing potentials","AAS Latex. 19 pages, 9 postscript figures",,"10.1086/305892","98-101","astro-ph",,"  We describe a new approach for the determination of cosmological parameters
using gravitational lensing systems with multiple arcs, exploiting the fact
that a given cluster can produce multiple arcs from sources over a broad range
in redshift. The coupling between the critical radius of a single arc and the
projected mass density of the lensing cluster can be avoided by considering the
relative positions of two or more arcs. Cosmological sensitivity appears
through the angular size-redshift relation. We consider simulated data
constructed using a more general form for the potential, realistic sources, and
an assumed cosmology and present a method for simultaneously inverting the lens
and extracting the cosmological parameters. The input data required are the
image and measured redshifts for the arcs. The technique relies upon the
conservation of surface brightness in gravitationally lensed systems. We find
that for a simple lens model our approach can recover the cosmological
parameters assumed in the construction of the simulated images.

exploits the quantum parallelism. This allows us to obtain new positive and
negative results. The positive results are novel quantum communication
protocols that are built from nontrivial quantum algorithms via this
simulation. These protocols, combined with (old and new) classical lower
bounds, are shown to provide the first asymptotic separation results between
the quantum and classical (probabilistic) two-party communication complexity
models. In particular, we obtain a quadratic separation for the bounded-error
model, and an exponential separation for the zero-error model. The negative
results transform known quantum communication lower bounds to computational
lower bounds in the black-box model. In particular, we show that the quadratic
speed-up achieved by Grover for the OR function is impossible for the PARITY
function or the MAJORITY function in the bounded-error model, nor is it
possible for the OR function itself in the exact case. This dichotomy naturally
suggests a study of bounded-depth predicates (i.e. those in the polynomial
hierarchy) between OR and MAJORITY. We present black-box algorithms that
achieve near quadratic speed up for all such predicates.
