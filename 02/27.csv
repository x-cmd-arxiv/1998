source associated to the remnant of the gamma-ray burst GRB970508 performed at
SAO RAS (Russia) from May to August 1997. The observations were carried out
with the standard (Johnson-Kron-Cousins) photometric BVRcIc system using the
1-meter and 6-meter telescopes. The brightness of the optical source increased
from Rc=21.19 (May 9.75 UT) to Rc=19.70 (May 10.77 UT), whereupon it was
decaying in all the four BVRcIc bands during about one month after the burst.
Between the 3rd and the 6th night after the GRB970508 event, the flux decrease
of the optical source follows an exponential law in all the four bands. In that
period the broad-band spectrum of the object does not change and can be
approximately described by a power with index -1.1. The subsequent observations
showed a reduction of the source brightness decrease rate in all bands. The
source flux decay after the maximum in the Rc band is well described by a
single power-law with index -1.171 for the whole set of observations during 86
days. In the other bands the decay seems to slow down from the 31th day
onwards. In particular, in the Ic band the source magnitude is about 23.1 from
the 36th day after the GRB to the end of the observations (August 4, 1997).

ionization Sedov-phase SNR models. All the remnants were well described by the
model, allowing us to derive accurate values for their ages, densities, initial
explosion energies, and metal abundances. Four SNRs are fully consistent with
the Sedov model and yield a mean value of the initial SN explosion energy of
(1.1+/-0.5)x10^51 erg. We show that it is likely that the other three remnants
exploded within preexisting cavities in the interstellar medium. The limits on
high energy X-ray emission (>3 keV) that we present indicate that these SNRs do
not contain very luminous pulsar-powered synchrotron nebulae. We find
statistical evidence for enrichment by supernova ejecta in the sense that
smaller remnants show a somewhat higher mean metallicity than the larger ones.
For DEM71, the remnant of a SN Ia, the derived Fe abundance is about a factor
of two larger than the other remnants in the sample. These things being said,
however, the derived abundances are in general dominated by swept-up
interstellar material and so we use the SNR sample to estimate the mean LMC
gas-phase abundances. We find that the astrophysically common elements from O
to Fe are less abundant than the solar values by factors of 2--4. Overall these
results are consistent with previous ones based on optical and UV data, but do
not show the anomalous overabundance of Mg and Si seen by others.

$\nu_e$ ($\bar\nu_e$) absorption on neutrons (protons) depends on the local
magnetic field strength due to the quantization of energy levels for the $e^-$

asymmetric magnetic field topology in the sense that the magnitude of magnetic
field in the north pole is different from that in the south pole, then
asymmetric neutrino emission may be generated. We calculate the absorption
cross sections of $\nue$ and $\bnue$ in strong magnetic fields as a function of
the neutrino energy. These cross sections exhibit oscillatory behaviors which
occur because new Landau levels for the $e^-$ ($e^+$) become accessible as the
neutrino energy increases. By evaluating the appropriately averaged neutrino
opacities, we demonstrate that the change in the local neutrino flux due to the
modified opacities is rather small. To generate appreciable kick velocity
($\sim 300$ km~s$^{-1}$) to the newly-formed neutron star, the difference in
the field strengths at the two opposite poles of the star must be at least
$10^{16}$~G. We also consider the magnetic field effect on the spectral
neutrino energy fluxes. The oscillatory features in the absorption opacities
give rise to modulations in the emergent spectra of $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$.

line shifts observed in eight transitions between 71 and 125 microns show good
agreement with models of thermal emission arising from a molecular cloud
subjected to a magnetohydrodynamic C-type shock. Both the breadth and the
relative strengths of the observed lines argue for emission from a shock rather
than from warm quiescent gas in the Orion core. Though one of the eight
transitions appears anomalously strong, and may be subject to the effects of
radiative pumping, the other seven indicate an H2O/H2 abundance ratio of order
5E-4, and a corresponding gas-phase oxygen-to-hydrogen abundance ratio of order
4E-4. Given current estimates of the interstellar, gas-phase, oxygen and carbon
abundances in the solar vicinity, this value is consistent with theoretical
shock models that predict the conversion into water of all the gas-phase oxygen
that is not bound as CO. The overall cooling provided by rotational transitions
of H2O in this region appears to be comparable to the cooling through
rotational lines of CO, but is an order of magnitude lower than cooling through
H2 emission. However, the model that best fits our observations shows cooling
by H2O and CO dominant in that portion of the post-shock region where
temperatures are below ~ 800 K and neither vibrational nor rotational radiative
cooling by H2 is appreciable.

very close to the stellar surface and have frequencies related to the orbital
frequencies of the gas. The 360-600 Hz brightness oscillations seen during
thermonuclear X-ray bursts are produced by one or two hotter regions on the
stellar surface and have frequencies equal to the stellar spin frequency or its
first overtone. Measurements of these oscillations are providing tight upper
bounds on the masses and radii of neutron stars, and important new constraints
on the equation of state of neutron star matter.

maximum likelihood estimate (which requires additional assumptions about
cluster luminosities), lead to the estimate Omega_0 \approx 0.45+/-0.2 (1-sigma
statistical error). Various systematic uncertainties are considered, none of
which enhance significantly the probability that Omega_0=1. These conclusions
hold for models with or without a cosmological constant. The statistical
uncertainties are at least as large as the individual systematic errors that
have been considered here, suggesting that additional temperature measurements
of distant clusters will allow an improvement in this estimate. An alternative
method that uses the highest redshift clusters to place an upper limit on
Omega_0 is also presented and tentatively applied, with the result that
Omega_0=1 can be ruled out at the 98 per cent confidence level. Whilst this
method does not require a well-defined statistical sample of distant clusters,
there are still modelling uncertainties that preclude a firmer conclusion at

dissipation due to collisions, in hot (dense) plasma the correlations form on

of the potential energy of binary interactions which measures the extent of
correlations. We discuss the dynamical formation of screening and compare with
the statical screened result.Comparisons are made with molecular dynamic

disconnected exterior regions. We investigate the Hawking(-Unruh) effect for a
real scalar field on the $\RPthree$ geon: an inextendible, globally hyperbolic,
space and time orientable eternal black hole spacetime that is locally
isometric to Kruskal but contains only one exterior region. The
Hartle-Hawking-like vacuum~$\hhvacgeon$, which can be characterized
alternatively by the positive frequency properties along the horizons or by the
complex analytic properties of the Feynman propagator, turns out to contain
exterior region Boulware modes in correlated pairs, and any operator in the
exterior that only couples to one member of each correlated Boulware pair has
thermal expectation values in the usual Hawking temperature. Generic operators
in the exterior do not have this special form; however, we use a Bogoliubov
transformation, a particle detector analysis, and a particle
emission-absorption analysis that invokes the analytic properties of the
Feynman propagator, to argue that $\hhvacgeon$ appears as a thermal bath with
the standard Hawking temperature to any exterior observer at asymptotically
early and late Schwarzschild times. A~(naive) saddle-point estimate for the
path-integral-approach partition function yields for the geon only half of the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole with the same ADM
mass: possible implications of this result for the validity of path-integral
methods or for the statistical interpretation of black-hole entropy are
discussed. Analogous results hold for a Rindler observer in a flat spacetime
whose global properties mimic those of the geon.

that this mode might be observable in asymmetric systems. This soft mode
approaches the isovector mode for high temperatures. At the same time the

in a three dimensional space $V_{3}$. The sign of the self-interacting terms of
the soliton equations are related to the signature of $V_{3}$. It is shown that
there corresponds a moving curve to each soliton equations.
