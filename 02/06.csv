Spectrometer (MECS) on board Beppo-SAX shows that the ratio of the flux of the

complex (dominated by Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission) is significantly larger than
predicted by standard thermal emission codes. Moreover the analysis of
spatially resolved spectra shows that the above ratio decreases with increasing
cluster radius. We find that, amongst the various explanations we consider, the
most likely requires the plasma to be optically thick for resonant scattering
at the energy of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line. We argue that if this is the case,
then measures of the iron abundance made using standard thermal emission codes,
that assume optically thin emission, can significantly underestimate the true
iron abundance. In the case of the core of Perseus we estimate the true
abundance to be $\sim$ 0.9 solar in a circular region with radius of $\sim 60$
kpc and centered on NGC 1275. Finally we speculate that similar results may

that the initial helium content of the stars populating these clusters is close
to the solar one. We also revisit a total of 28 halo clusters, for which we use
an updated [Fe/H] scale. This new metallicity scale leads on average to an age
reduction of around 0.8 Gyr relative to our previous results. We compare the
predicted cluster distances, which result from our dating method, with the most

The evolutionary models, on the other hand, predict that the vast majority

times smaller than observed. For nonradial Delta Scuti pulsators of Pop. I, the
discrepancies are even larger. The behavior suggests that for these relatively
unevolved stars the rate of evolution cannot be deduced from the period
changes. The period changes of most Pop. II Delta Scuti (SX Phe) stars are
characterized by sudden jumps of the order of Delta P/P approx. 10^-6. However,
at least one star, BL Cam, shows a large, continuous period increase. The
variety of observed behavior also seems to exclude an evolutionary origin of
the changes. Model calculations show that the evolutionary period changes of

changes. We present the basic equations for thermonuclear reaction rates and
nuclear reaction networks. The required nuclear physics input for reaction
rates is discussed, i.e. cross sections for nuclear reactions,
photodisintegrations, electron and positron captures, neutrino captures,
inelastic neutrino scattering, and beta-decay half-lives. We examine especially
the present state of uncertainties in predicting thermonuclear reaction rates,
while the status of experiments is discussed by others in this volume (see M.
Wiescher). It follows a brief review of hydrostatic burning stages in stellar
evolution before discussing the fate of massive stars, i.e. the nucleosynthesis
in type II supernova explosions (SNe II). Except for SNe Ia, which are
explained by exploding white dwarfs in binary stellar systems (which will not
be discussed here), all other supernova types seem to be linked to the
gravitational collapse of massive stars (M$>$8M$_\odot$) at the end of their
hydrostatic evolution. SN1987A, the first type II supernova for which the
progenitor star was known, is used as an example for nucleosynthesis
calculations. Finally, we discuss the production of heavy elements in the
r-process up to Th and U and its possible connection to supernovae.

  Reference : Phys. Rev. B (accepted for publication)",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.57.13414",,"cond-mat",,"  The co-existence of band Jahn-Teller (BJT) effect with superconductivity (SC)
is studied for correlated systems, with orbitally degenerate bands using a
simple model. The Hubbard model for a doubly degenerate orbital with the
on-site intraorbital Coulomb repulsion treated in the slave boson formalism and
the interorbital Coulomb repulsion treated in the Hartree-Fock mean field
approximation, describes the correlated system. The model further incorporates
the BJT interaction and a pairing term to account for the lattice distortion
and superconductivity respectively. It is found that structural distortion
tends to suppress superconductivity and when SC sets in at low temperatures,
the growth of the lattice distortion is arrested. The phase diagram comprising
of the SC and structural transition temperatures $T_c$ and $T_s$ versus the
dopant concentration $\delta $ reveals that the highest obtainable $T_c$ for an
optimum doping is limited by structural transition. The dependence of the
occupation probabilities of the different bands as well as the density of
states (DOS) in the distorted-superconducting phase, on electron correlation
has been discussed.

A ""fine moduli

an integral variety M such that : F is flat on M; for all distinct points x, y
of M the sheaves F_x, F_y on X are not isomorphic and F is a complete

is devoted to the study of such fine moduli spaces. We first give some general
results, and apply them in three cases on the projective plane : the fine
moduli spaces of prioritary sheaves, the fine moduli spaces consisting of
simple rank 1 sheaves, and those which come from moduli spaces of morphisms. In
the first case we give an exemple of a fine moduli space defined locally but
not globally, in the second an exemple of a maximal non projective fine moduli
space, and in the third we find a projective fine moduli space consisting of
simple torsion free sheaves, containing stable sheaves, but which is different
from the corresponding moduli space of stable sheaves.

the mixed phase model successfully reproduces both the available lattice data

systems evaluated within the modern models. The 'softest point' of the equation
of state resulting in a possible formation of a long-lived fireball in nuclear
collisions (the 'softest point' effect) is analyzed. The obtained results are
confronted with the data on the two-phase model. Some manifestation of the

expansion dynamics. We discuss experimental possibilities of observing the

of adding a small amount of ionic compound XY to pure water leads to the

structure of the cluster around the ion depends strongly on the equation of
state. We explore the consequences of possible polymorphic states of H2O in the
liquid phase at room temperature. If there are low-lying polymorphic states,
the local dipole moment and the local density will change discontinuously as a
function of the radial distance from the ion, and regions of different
polymorphic states will be found at different separations from the ion.
Fragmentation of the cluster by vigorous shaking may break up the cluster into
small domains to allow subsequent coalescence of these domains or the growth of
the domains as seeds to form greater domains of polymorphic states. Further
experimental and theoretical analyses are needed to study these pictures.

allows us to study arbitrary deformations in space and time of the perfectly
reflecting (conducting) boundaries of a cavity. The mechanical response of the
intervening vacuum is calculated to linear order in the frequency-wavevector
plane, using which a plethora of interesting phenomena can be studied. For a
single corrugated plate we find a correction to mass at low frequencies, and an
effective shear viscosity at high frequencies that are both anisotropic. The
anisotropy is set by the wavevector of the corrugation. For two plates, the
mass renormalization is modified by a function of the ratio between the
separation of the plates and the wave-length of corrugations. The dissipation
rate is not modified for frequencies below the lowest optical mode of the
cavity, and there is a resonant dissipation for all frequencies greater than
that. In this regime, a divergence in the response function implies that such
high frequency deformation modes of the cavity can not be excited by any
macroscopic external forces. This phenomenon is intimately related to resonant
particle creation. For particular examples of two corrugated plates that are
stationary, or moving uniformly in the lateral directions, Josephson-like
effects are observed. For capillary waves on the surface of mercury a
renormalization to surface tension, and sound velocity is obtained.
