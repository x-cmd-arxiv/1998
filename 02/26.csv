energy dependent variations. BATSE observed five additional weak outbursts from
GRO J2058+42, each with two week duration and peak pulsed flux of about 15
mCrab (20-50 keV), that were spaced by about 110 days. An observation of the
1996 November outburst by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Proportional

circle (90 % confidence) centered on R.A. = 20h 59m.0, Decl. = 41 deg 43 arcmin

were detected by BATSE halfway between the first four 15 mCrab outbursts. The
RXTE All-Sky Monitor detected all 8 weak outbursts with approximately equal
durations and intensities. GRO J2058+42 is most likely a Be/X-ray binary that
appears to outburst at periastron and apastron. No optical counterpart has been

bounded, at most, between the inner and outer Lindblad resonances of the spiral

Studying such galaxies can teach us how the action of resonances sculpts the

for large scale (square degree) mapping of line and continuum radiation from

core of the cluster accretes from the surrounding gas, thereby decreasing its
radius until collisions between individual components become significant. These
components are, in general, intermediate-mass stars that have formed through
accretion onto low-mass protostars. Once a sufficiently massive star has formed
to expel the remaining gas, the cluster expands in accordance with this loss of
mass, halting further collisions. This process implies a critical stellar
density for the formation of massive stars, and a high rate of binaries formed
by tidal capture.

viscosity of PPM represent a substantial advance over previous studies using
SPH. We find that in flat, hierarchical cosmological models, the ICM is in a
turbulent state long after turbulence generated by the last major merger should
have decayed away. Turbulent velocites are found to vary slowly with cluster
radius, being $\sim 25%$ of $\sigma_{vir}$ in the core, increasing to $\sim
60%$ at the virial radius. We argue that more frequent minor mergers maintain
the high level of turbulence found in the core where dynamical times are short.
Turbulent pressure support is thus significant throughout the cluster, and
results in a somewhat cooler cluster ($T/T_{vir} \sim .8$) for its mass. Some

is that there is no invariant way to split a given four geometry into
background plus perturbations. So the prescription would have to violate
general coordinate invariance. There are other indications that a sign change
is problematic. With the choice $P \sim e^{+S}$ the nucleation of primordial

approximations. In particular, this parametrization takes into account both
rescattering and electroweak penguin effects, which limit the theoretical
accuracy of bounds on $\gamma$ arising from the combined $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K$,
$B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$ branching ratios. Generalized bounds making also use of

argue using the spacetime string theory, and check using the beta functions
(exactly for N=2,1 and so far at 1-loop for the gauge couplings in the N=0

potentially gives well-defined non-supersymmetric vacua of string theory, with
a mechanism for making the curvature and cosmological constant small at
nontrivial string coupling. We suggest a correspondence between
nonsupersymmetric conformal fixed lines and nonsupersymmetric string vacua with
vanishing vacuum energy.

Hermitian to have a real, positive spectrum. What seems to be required is
symmetry under combined parity and time-reversal transformations. This idea is
extended to massless electrodynamics, in which the photon couples to the
axial-vector current with an imaginary coupling constant. The eigenvalue
condition necessary for the finiteness of the theory can now be solved; the
value for the charge appears to be stable order-by-order. Similarly, the
semiclassical Casimir model for the fine-structure constant yields a positive

We express the expected distance <D_k(N)> from an arbitrary point on the
surface to its kth-nearest neighboring site, in terms of the function A(l)
giving the area of a disc of radius l about that point. We then find two
universalities. First, for a flat surface, where A(l)=\pi l^2, the k-dependence
and the N-dependence separate in <D_k(N)>. All kth-nearest neighbor distances
thus have the same scaling law in N. Second, for a curved surface, the average
\int <D_k(N)> d\mu over the surface is a topological invariant at leading and
subleading order in a large N expansion. The 1/N scaling series then depends,
up through O(1/N), only on the surface's topology and not on its precise shape.

using Regge calculus.
