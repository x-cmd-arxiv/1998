been completed. 327 QSOs (Mb<-23, 0.3<z<2.2) have been selected over 555 deg^2

2.2 higher than what measured by the PG survey, corresponding to a surface
density of 0.013+/-.006 deg^{-2}. If the Edinburgh QSO Survey is included, an
overdensity of a factor 2.7 is observed, corresponding to a density of
0.016+/-0.005 deg^{-2}. In order to derive the QSO optical luminosity function
(LF) we used Monte Carlo simulations that take into account of the selection
criteria, photometric errors and QSO spectral slope distribution. The LF can be
represented with a Pure Luminosity Evolution (L(z)\propto(1+z)^k) of a two
power law both for q_0=0.5 and q_0=0.1. For q_0=0.5 k=3.26, slower than the
previous Boyle's (1992) estimations of k=3.45. A flatter slope beta=-3.72 of
the bright part of the LF is also required. The observed overdensity of bright
QSOs is concentrated at z<0.6. It results that in the range 0.3<z<0.6 the
luminosity function is flatter than observed at higher redshifts. In this
redshift range, for Mb<-25, 32 QSOs are observed instead of 19 expected from
our best-fit PLE model. This feature requires a luminosity dependent luminosity
evolution in order to satisfactorily represent the data in the whole 0.3<z<2.2

neutrino flares if protons takes most of the energy from the reconnection

fitting its predictions to exact Pariser-Parr-Pople model calculations of
benzene and biphenyl, and it is solved using the density matrix renormalisation
group method. It is shown that there exists a band of Bu (s-wave) excitons
below the band states. In the long chain limit the lowest exciton is situated
3.3 eV above the ground state, consistent with experimental data. The
calculated particle-hole separation of these excitons indicates that they are
tightly bound, extending over only a few repeat units. The lowest band state is
found to be a covalent 2Ag state, whose energy almost coincides with the charge
gap Eg. Lying just above the 2Ag state is a band Bu state (the nBu state). The
particle-hole separation of the band states scales linearly with oligomer size.
The binding energy of the 1Bu exciton is determined rigorously as 0.74 eV. The

electroabsorption (EA) and third harmonic generation, are investigated. A

be observed in near future experiments. From the data on neutrino oscillation
and the electric dipole moment of electron, under some circumstances it is
possible to obtain constraint on the complex phase of some supersymmetry

the framework of a variant of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking. It comes
clear, that the parameters of the theory, being obtained earlier and describing
deviations from SM in Z --> \bar b b decay, are also consistent with the
existence of a nontrivial solution for vertex \bar t (Z,\gamma) c. The
occurrence of this solution leads to a significant enhancement in neutral
flavor changing transition t --> c. The intensity of this transition is
connected with the c-quark mass, that leads to estimates of probabilities of
exotic decays t --> c (Z,\gamma) (few %) and of the cross-section of a single
t-quark production in process e^+e^- --> t \bar c at LEP2 (around 0.03 pb at

finite-size neutron star is studied. We use an effective Lagrangian, which
incorporates the effect of the neutrons on the neutrinos. Following Schwinger,
it is shown that the total interaction energy density is computed by comparing
the zero point energy of the neutrino sea with and without the star. It has
already been shown that in an infinite-size star the total energy due to
neutrino exchange vanishes exactly. The opposite claim that massless neutrino
exchange would produce a huge energy is due to an improper summation of an
infrared-divergent quantity. The same vanishing of the total energy has been
proved exactly in the case of a finite star in a one-dimensional toy model.
  Here we study the three-dimensional case. We first consider the effect of a
sharp star border, assumed to be a plane. We find that there is a non-
vanishing of the zero point energy density difference between the inside and
the outside due to the refraction index at the border and the consequent
non-penetrating waves. An analytical and numerical calculation for the case of
a spherical star with a sharp border confirms that the preceding border effect
is the dominant one. The total result is shown to be infrared-safe, thus
confirming that there is no need to assume a neutrino mass. The ultraviolet
cut-offs, which correspond in some sense to the matching of the effective
theory with the exact one, are discussed. Finally the energy due to long
distance neutrino exchange is of the order of $10^{-8} -- 10^{-13} GeV per
neutron$, i.e. negligible with respect to the neutron mass density.

results on a nonnegative matrix that are given in terms of its classes to
results for a cone-preserving map on a polyhedral cone, formulated in terms of
its invariant faces. In particular, we obtain the following extension of the
famous Rothblum Index Theorem for a nonnegative matrix: If $A$ leaves invariant
a polyhedral cone $K$, then for each distinguished eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $A$
for $K$, there is a chain of $m_\lambda$ distinct $A$-invariant
join-irreducible faces of $K$, each containing in its relative interior a
generalized eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to $\lambda$ (referred to as
semi-distinguished $A$-invariant faces associated with $\lambda$), where
$m_\lambda$ is the maximal order of distinguished generalized eigenvectors of
$A$ corresponding to $\lambda$, but there is no such chain with more than
$m_\lambda$ members. We introduce the important new concepts of
semi-distinguished $A$-invariant faces, and of spectral pairs of faces
associated with a cone-preserving map, and obtain several properties of a
