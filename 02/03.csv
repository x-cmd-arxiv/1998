HST/WFPC2, IRAM and CFHT/FOCAM images data. The WFPC2 data shows a significant
overdensity of galaxies around the Cloverleaf that we interpret as the presence
of a distant cluster of galaxies along the line of sight. The Cloverleaf is
probably the result of the lensing effects which include, in addition to a
single galaxy, a distant clusters of galaxies. We have modelled the lens
accordingly. The high-resolution IRAM/CO map provides the orientation and the
ellipticity of the CO spots induced by the shear component. Velocity-positional
effects are detected at the 8$\sigma$ level in the CO map. A strong limit can
then be put on the size, shape and location of the CO source around the quasar.
  The CO source is found to form a disk- or ring- structure orbiting the
central engine at $\sim$ 100km/s at a radial distance of $\sim$ 100pc, leading
to a central mass of $\sim$ 10$^{9}$ M$_\odot$ possibly in the form of a black
hole.

dissipation of bulk energy in relativistic outflows, but their engine has not
been unambiguously identified. The engine could be a young pulsar formed from
accretion induced collapse with a dynamo amplified field. Elsewhere, we suggest
that such a ``Usov type'' strong field pulsar may help explain the bimodal
distribution in GRB durations. Here we discuss possible roles of a pulsar for
the afterglow. We derive the expected bolometric luminosity decay. The
extracted rotational energy could dissipate by shocks or by large amplitude
electromagnetic waves (LAEMW). The simplest LAEMW approach predicts a slower
decay in observed afterglow peak frequency and faster decay in flux than the
simplest blast-wave model, though more complicated models of both can provide
different dependences. LAEMW do not require the rapid magnetic field
amplification demanded of the blast-wave approach because the emission
originates from a nearly fixed radius. Different time dependent behavior of GRB
and post-GRB emission is also predicted. Observational evidence for a pulsar in
a GRB would make some GRB engine models, such as neutron star mergers and black
holes unlikely. Therefore, the question of whether a pulsar is present is an
important one even if it could drive a canonical fireball.

are present. The small spread in the colors of the blue clusters is consistent
with the hypothesis that they are a single age population, with an inferred age
of 0.1 to 1 Gyr. The luminosity function shows increasing numbers of blue
clusters to the limit of our photometry, which reaches several magnitudes past
the turnover predicted if the cluster population were identical to current
Galactic globulars seen at a younger age. The blue clusters have a spatial
distribution which is more centrally peaked than that of the red clusters. The
individual clusters are slightly resolved, with core radii <~ 0.75 pc if they
have modified Hubble profiles. We estimate the specific frequencies of the old
and young populations and discuss the uncertainties in these estimates. We find
that the specific frequency of the young population in NGC 1275 is currently
larger than that of the old population and will remain so as the young
population evolves, even if the majority of the low mass clusters are
eventually destroyed. If the young population formed during a previous merger,
this suggests that mergers can increase the specific frequency of globulars in
a galaxy. However, the presently observed young population likely contains too
few clusters to have a significant impact on the overall specific frequency as
it will be observed in the future.

slope coincident with the direction of the extragalactic magnetic field. In

real warp curves, in particular the 21 cm warp curve of NGC 5907. If the

allow rough estimations of the strength and direction of the magnetic field. We
also propose a magnetic field distribution for the outermost part of the

studying the rotation curve of the Galaxy. These kinematics -- usually
parameterized by the Oort constants A and B -- depend on the local gradient of
the rotation curve as well as its absolute value (Theta_0), and the Sun's
distance to the Galactic center (R_0). The density of interstellar gas in the
Milky Way is shown to vary non-monotonically with radius, and so contributes
significantly to the local gradient of the rotation curve. We have therefore
calculated mass models for the Milky Way that include this component, and have
derived the corresponding radial variation in the Oort constants. Between
0.9R_0 and 1.2R_0, the Oort functions, A(R) and B(R), differ significantly from
the general Theta/R dependence. Various previously-inexplicable observations
are shown to be consistent with these predictions. These models can explain the
40% difference between the values for 2 A R_0 derived from radial velocity data
originating in the inner and outer Galaxy. They also go some way toward
explaining the different shapes of the velocity ellipsoids of giant and dwarf
stars in the solar neighbourhood. However, a consistent picture only emerges if
one adopts small values of R_0 = 7.1 +/- 0.4 kpc and Theta_0 = 184 +/- 8 km/s.
With these Galactic constants, the Milky Way's rotation curve declines slowly
in the outer Galaxy; V_rot(20 kpc) = 166 kms. Our low value for R_0 agrees well
with the only direct determination (7.2 +/- 0.7 kpc, Reid 1993). Using these
Galactic constants, we find that the proper motion of Sgr A^* is consistent
with the observational constraints. The radial velocities and proper motions of
our best fit model are entirely consistent with the radial velocities of
Cepheids and the Hipparcos measurements of their proper motions.

spatial luminosity distribution approaches a power law form at small radii, in
accordance with the results of recent ground based observations, and with the
Hubble Space Telescope; the dark matter has a peaked profile too, as indicated
by high resolution numerical simulations of dissipationless collapse; the dark
to luminous mass ratio spans a large range of values, including low values
found by optical studies confined to within two effective radii; finally, the
type Ia supernova rate is that given by the latest estimates of optical
surveys, or zero, as suggested by the iron abundances recently measured in the
hot gas. We find that the resulting gas flows are strongly decoupled: an inflow
develops in the central region of the galaxies, while the external parts are
still degassing, i.e., the flows are mostly partial winds. This behavior can be
explained in terms of the local energy balance of the hot gas. A large spread
in the X-ray luminosity Lx at fixed optical luminosity Lb can be produced as in
previous simulations that used King models plus massive quasi-isothermal dark
halos, and higher supernova rates; the key factor causing large Lx variations
is now the size of the central inflow region. The highest Lx observed
correspond to global inflows. Finally, non negligible amounts of cold gas can
be produced by the partial winds; this could be an explanation for the possible
discovery of cold matter at the center of elliptical galaxies, an alternative
to the presence of a steady state cooling flow.

in the fraction of peculiar galaxies on deep HST images. A new technique is
then described which models the spatially resolved internal colors of high
redshift galaxies, as a probe of the processes driving galaxy evolution. This
``morphophotometric'' approach investigates directly the evolutionary history
of stellar populations, and is a sensitive test of the mechanisms through which
galaxies build up and evolve in the field. As a case study, we analyse several
``chain galaxies'' in the Hubble Deep Field. These chain galaxies are shown to
be protogalaxies undergoing their first significant episodes of star-formation,
and not simply distant edge-on spirals.

Monte Carlo method in conjunction with the finite size scaling method, of the
critical properties of the Ising model on some two dimensional deterministic
fractal lattices with different Hausdorff dimensions. Those with finite
ramification order do not display ordered phases at any finite temperature,
whereas the lattices with infinite connectivity show genuine critical behavior.
In particular we considered two Sierpinski carpets constructed using different
generators and characterized by Hausdorff dimensions d_H=log 8/log 3 = 1.8927..
and d_H=log 12/log 4 = 1.7924.., respectively.
  The data show in a clear way the existence of an order-disorder transition at
finite temperature in both Sierpinski carpets.
  By performing several Monte Carlo simulations at different temperatures and
on lattices of increasing size in conjunction with a finite size scaling
analysis, we were able to determine numerically the critical exponents in each
case and to provide an estimate of their errors.
  Finally we considered the hyperscaling relation and found indications that it
holds, if one assumes that the relevant dimension in this case is the Hausdorff
dimension of the lattice.

magnitude of the persistent spin current in a ring depends on the direction of
the direct current flow from one reservoir to another. The persistent spin
current is modulated by the cosine function of the spin precession angle. The
nonadiabatic Aharonov-Casher phase gives anomalous behaviors. The
Aharonov-Anandan phase is determined by the solid angle of spin precession.
When the nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase approaches a constant value with
the increase of the electric field, the periodic behavior of the spin

implementation of a philosophical bias related to the equivalence principle, we

In particular we argue that the theorem proved by Kay, Radzikowski, and Wald to
the effect that time machines with compactly generated Cauchy horizons are
incompatible with the F-locality condition actually does not support the
""chronology protection conjecture"", but rather testifies that the F-locality
condition must be modified or abandoned. We also show that this condition
imposes a severe restriction on the geometry of the world (it is just this
restriction that comes into conflict with the existence of a time machine),
which does not follow from the above mentioned philosophical bias. So, one need
not sacrifice the GH-equivalence principle to ""emend"" the F-locality condition.
As an example we consider a particular modification, the ""MF-locality
condition"". The theory obtained by replacing the F-locality condition with the
MF-locality condition possesses a few attractive features. One of them is that
it is consistent with both locality and the existence of time machines.

vector meson dominance, we have developed a model for the forward vector
meson-nucleon scattering amplitudes. We use this as an input to calculate the
low energy part of the current-current correlation function in nuclear matter.
For the isovector channel we find a significant enhancement of the in-medium
spectral density below the $\rho$ resonance while the $\rho$ meson mass itself
changes only slightly. The situation is different in the isoscalar channel,
where the mass and peak position of the $\omega$ meson move downward while its
width increases moderately. For the $\phi$ meson we find almost no mass shift,
but the width of the peak increases significantly. We use these spectra as
``left hand side'' of in medium QCD sum rules and observe a remarkable degree
of consistency with the operator product expansion ``right hand''side in all
three channels. We point out, however, that these results cannot simply be
interpreted, as commonly done, in terms of a universal rescaling of vector
meson masses in matter. We also compare the resulting thermal dilepton rates of
our model with CERES data. We find satisfactory agreement but we point out that
the dilepton rates from completely uncorrelated quark-antiquark pairs also fit
the data quite well. Considering the strongly attractive potential for the
$\omega$ together with its comparably small width, we discuss the possible
formation of bound $\omega$ states in nuclei. Using a Green's function approach
we investigate the possibility of detecting these bound states in the $A(d,

different observables. Assuming that the existence of a fixed point requires
convergence of the BZ expansion for any observable, we can be pretty sure that
there is no fixed point for N_f\lsim 12. The consequences of the Crewther
relation concerning perturbative freezing are analyzed. We also emphasize that
time-like quantities have a consistent infrared limit only when the

freezing can lead to an analyticity structure in the complex momentum-squared

$\bar{\theta}$ which violate bounds coming from the neutron electric dipole
moment (EDM), one needs a scheme for the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters
which can naturally give sufficient squark degeneracies and proportionality of
trilinear soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters to Yukawa couplings. We show
that a gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking sector can provide the needed
degeneracy and proportionality, though that proves to be a problem for generic
Nelson-Barr models. The workable model we consider here has the Nelson-Barr
mass texture enforced by a gauge symmetry; one also expects a new U(1) gauge
superfield with mass in the TeV range. The resulting model is predictive. We
predict a measureable neutron EDM and the existence of extra vector-like quark
superfields which can be discovered at the LHC. Because the $3\times 3$
Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is approximately real, the model also predicts
a flat unitarity triangle and the absence of substantial CP violation in the
$B$ system at future $B$ factories. We discuss the general issues pertaining to
the construction of such a workable model and how they lead to the successful
strategy. A detailed renormalization group study is then used to establish the

A scenario describing the physics beyond the standard model is developed based
on a finite quantum field theory (FQFT) and the group G=$SO(3,1)\otimes
SU(3)\otimes SU(2)\otimes U(1)$. The field theory is Poincar\'e invariant,
gauge invariant, finite and unitary to all orders of perturbation theory and
has a fundamental scale which is chosen to be $\Lambda_F =1/\sqrt{G_F}\sim 300$
GeV, where $G_F$ is the Fermi coupling constant. The physical Higgs particle is
protected from acquiring a large mass beyond $\sim 1$ TeV, removing the gauge
hierarchy problem associated with the scalar Higgs field. This avoids the need
for a composite Higgs field or supersymmetry. The coupling constants and the
fermion masses can be calculated from a set of low-energy relativistic
eigenvalue equations based on truncated Green's functions and the FQFT,
reducing the number of free parameters in the model without a grand unification
scheme. The proton is predicted to be stable. Quantum gravity is perturbatively
finite and unitary to all orders.

of a survey lecture at the September 1997 Obergurgl working week---is to
indicate some (not all) of the efforts that have been made to interpret
equisingularity, and connections among them; and to suggest directions for
further exploration.
  Zariski defined equisingularity on an n-dimensional hypersurface V via
stratification by ``dimensionality type,"" an integer associated to a point by
means of a generic local projection to affine n-space. A possibly more
intuitive concept of equisingularity can be based on stratification by
simultaneous resolvability of singularities. The two approaches are known to be
equivalent for families of plane curve singularities. In higher dimension we
ask whether constancy of dimensionality type along a smooth subvariety W of V
implies the existence of a simultaneous resolution of the singularities of V
along W. (The converse is false.)
  The underlying idea is to follow the classical inductive strategy of
Jung--begin by desingularizing the discriminant of a generic projection--to
reduce to asking if there is a canonical resolution process which when applied
to quasi-ordinary singularities depends only on their characteristic monomials.
This appears to be so in dimension 2. In higher dimensions the question is
quite open.

E81-A (1998) 1762-1768",,,"quant-ph chao-dyn cond-mat nlin.CD",,"  In this paper, we show that two-dimensional billiards with point interactions
inside exhibit a chaotic nature in the microscopic world, although their
classical counterpart is non-chaotic. After deriving the transition matrix of
the system by using the self-adjoint extension theory of functional analysis,
we deduce the general condition for the appearance of chaos. The prediction is
confirmed by numerically examining the statistical properties of energy
spectrum of rectangular billiards with multiple point interactions inside. The
dependence of the level statistics on the strength as well as the number of the
scatterers is displayed.

  Berlin, 1996","Int.J.Theor.Phys. 37 (1998) 241-247",,,"quant-ph",,"  The quantum measurement problem is formulated in the form of an insolubility
theorem that states the impossibility of obtaining, for all available object
preparations, a mixture of states of the compound object and apparatus system
that would represent definite pointer positions. A proof is given that
comprises arbitrary object observables, whether sharp or unsharp, and besides
sharp pointer observables a certain class of unsharp pointers, namely, those
allowing for the property of pointer value definiteness. A recent result of H.
Stein is applied to allow for the possibility that a given measurement may not
be applicable to all possible object states but only to a subset of them. The
question is raised whether the statement of the insolubility theorem remains
true for genuinely unsharp observables. This gives rise to a precise notion of
unsharp objectification.

exactly solvable models like the Coulomb and the harmonic oscillator
potentials. The $D$ dimensional generalized Coulomb potential contains these
potentials as limiting cases, thus it establishes a continuous link between the
Coulomb and harmonic oscillator potentials in various dimensions. We present
results which are necessary for the utilization of this potential as a model
and practical reference problem for quantum mechanical calculations. We define
a Hilbert space basis, the generalized Coulomb-Sturmian basis, and calculate
the Green's operator on this basis and also present an SU(1,1) algebra
associated with it. We formulate the problem for the one-dimensional case too,
and point out that the complications arising due to the singularity of the
one-dimensional Coulomb problem can be avoided with the use of the generalized
Coulomb potential.

integrable equations, like the KdV, mKdV and NLS hierarchies etc. In this paper
we consider whether integrable equations in ($2 + 1$) dimensions have also the
analogous hierarchies to those in ($1 + 1$) dimensions. Explicitly is discussed
the Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff(BS) equation. For the BS hierarchy, there appears an
ambiguity in the Painlev\'e test. Nevertheless, it may be concluded that the BS
hierarchy is integrable.
