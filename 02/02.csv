for cosmology because it probes the amount and the nature of dark matter, and
provides information on the density parameter $\Omega$, the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ and the Hubble constant $H_{o}$. Therefore, gravitational
lensing can constrain the cosmological scenario which gave birth to the
Universe as it appears today. The ongoing programs and future projects which
are developing now all over the world show that gravitational lensing is
considered as a major cosmological tool for the coming years as well. In this
review, we summarize some of the most recent advances in the fields relevant
for the dark matter issue. We will focus on the microlensing, the arc(let)s and
the weak lensing studies. The possibility to check the existence of a non-zero
$\Lambda$ is presented elsewhere.

where $F$ denotes the force acting on the vortex ($F_{c}$ is the critical
force).
  The dynamics of the vortex is supposed to be of the Hall type. The Euclidean
action $S_{Eucl}(T)$ is calculated in the entire temperature range; the result
is universal and does not depend on the detailed form of the pinning potential.
We show that the transition from quantum to classical behavior is second-order
like with the temperature $T_{c}$ of the transition scaling like $F^{{4}/{3}}.$
Special attention is paid to the regime of applicability of our results, in
particular, the influence of the large vortex mass appearing in the superclean
limit is discussed.

on the puzzling semiconducting behavior of the Pb/Ge(111), K/Si(111):B and

appears to be an extremely narrow surface state band. We have carried out so

their inherent quantum gravitational nature to classical behaviour comes about
-- a transition whereby none of the successful quantitative predictions of the
inflationary scenario for the present-day universe is changed. This is made
possible by two properties. First, the quantum state for the spacetime metric
perturbations produced by quantum gravitational effects in the early Universe
becomes very special (highly squeezed) as a result of the expansion of the
Universe (as long as the wavelength of the perturbations exceeds the Hubble
radius). Second, decoherence through the environment distinguishes the field
amplitude basis as being the pointer basis. This renders the perturbations
presently indistinguishable from stochastic classical inhomogeneities.
