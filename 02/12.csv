momentum of their main sequence progenitors but a result of the mass loss
process on the AGB. Weak magnetic fields, if present in stellar interiors, are
likely to maintain approximately uniform rotation in stars, both on the main
sequence and on the giant branches. The nearly uniform rotation of the core of
the Sun is evidence for the existence of such fields. Exactly axisymmetric mass
loss on the AGB from uniformly rotating stars would lead lead to white dwarfs
with very long rotation periods ($>$ 10 yr). Small random non-axisymmetries
($\sim 10^{-3}$) in the mass loss process, on the other hand, add sufficient
angular momentum to explain the observed rotation periods around one day. The
process illustrated with a computation of the probability distribution of the
rotation periods under the combined influence of random forcing by weak
nonaxisymmetries and angular momentum loss in the AGB superwind. Such
asymmetries can in principle be observed by proper motion studies of the clumps

is modeled with a generalized exponential law of integer index n, and the disk
with a simple exponential. We find that the derived bulge parameters, for a
given galaxy, vary systematically with the bulge shape index n. The mean
early-type bulge has a best-fit n = 2.6, and 80% of the sample has best n of 2
or 3. Bulges are rarely spherical; the median bulge intrinsic ellipticity is
0.33. The median early-type disk has (J-K)_d more than 0.1 mag bluer than the
bulge, and a NIR disk surface brightness more than 1 mag arcsec^{-2} brighter
than later-type disks. Our data are consistent with the well-established
correlation of both bulge and disk surface brightness with physical scale
length, and we note that the location of bulges within this projection of the
fundamental plane depends on their shape index n. In agreement with previous
work, the ratios of bulge and disk scale lengths are consistent with a constant
value r_e/r_d = 0.3; however, such value again depends on the bulge index n,

X-ray data. This feature may be interpreted in terms of cyclotron emission
originated from a mixture of H/He ions in the neutron star's atmosphere. In the
case of pure Hydrogen, the feature wavelength would imply a magnetic field of
order 3-5 10d11 G, consistent with the value deduced from the dynamical
parameters of the pulsar. If due to a cyclotron emission, the observation of
this feature would represent the first case of an in situ measurement of the
surface magnetic field of an isolated neutron star.

projected mass density of a galaxy cluster using its gravitational lensing
effects on background galaxies. We demonstrate the method by reconstructing the
mass distribution in a model cluster using simulated shear and magnification
data to which Gaussian noise is added. The mass distribution is reconstructed
directly and the inversion is regularised using the entropic prior for this
positive additive distribution. For realistic noise levels, we find that the
method faithfully reproduces the main features of the cluster mass distribution
not only within the observed field but also slightly beyond it. We estimate the
uncertainties on the reconstruction by calculating an analytic approximation to
the covariance matrix of the reconstruction values of each pixel. This result
is compared with error estimates derived from Monte-Carlo simulations for
different noise realisations and found to be in good agreement.

experimental evidence, we stress the need for novel methods of averaging and
propose a novel ``canonical'' averaging scheme for the analysis of structure
factors of turbulent flows. The strategy is to determine the scale $r_c$ at
which the dissipation rate is the largest in a given turn-over time series.
This specific scale $r_c$ translates into a specific ``phase'' in the logarithm
of the scale which, when used as the origin, allows one to phase up the
different measurements of a structure factor $S_p(r) = A_p (\bar\epsilon
r)^{p/3}$ in different turn-over time realizations. We expect, as in Laplacian
growth and in rupture, that the log-periodic oscillations will be reinforced by
this canonical averaging. Demonstrating unambiguously the presence of
log-periodicity and thus of discrete scale invariance (DSI) in turbulent
time-series would provide an important step towards a direct demonstration of
the Kolmogorov cascade or at least of its hierarchical imprint.

generated from the Wilson gauge action, an improved gauge action, and several

characterization of the spectrum. In region I defined by $m\le m_1$, the
spectrum has a gap. In region II defined by $m_1\le m \le 2$, the gap is
closed. The level crossings in H(m) that occur in region II correspond to
localized eigenmodes and the localization size decreases monotonically with the
crossing point down to a size of about one lattice spacing. These small modes
are unphysical, and we find the topological susceptibility is relatively stable
in the part of region II where the small modes cross. We argue that the lack of
a gap in region II is expected to persist in the infinite volume limit at any
gauge coupling. The presence of a gap is important for the implementation of
domain wall fermions.

at zero temperature and of QCD at temperatures around the phase transition. To
smooth out dislocations and the UV noise we cool the configurations with an
action which has scale invariant instanton solutions for instanton size above
about 2.3 lattice spacings. The corresponding ""improved"" topological charge
stabilizes at an integer value after few cooling sweeps. At zero temperature
the susceptibility calculated from this charge (about (195MeV)^4 for SU(2) and
(185 MeV)^4 for SU(3)) agrees very well with the phenomenological expectation.
At the minimal amount of cooling necessary to resolve the structure in terms of
instantons and anti-instantons we observe a dense ensemble where the total
number of peaks is by a factor 5-10 larger than the net charge. The average
size observed for these peaks at zero temperature is about 0.4-0.45 fm for
SU(2) and 0.5-0.6 fm for SU(3). The size distribution changes very little with
further cooling, although in this process up to 90% of the peaks disappear by
pair annihilation. For QCD we observe below T_c a reduction of the topological
susceptibility as an effect of the dynamical fermions. Nevertheless also here
the instantons form a dense ensemble with general characteristics similar to
those of the quenched theory. A further drop in the susceptibility above T_c is
also in rough agreement with what has been observed for pure SU(3). We see no
clear signal for dominant formation of instanton - anti-instanton molecules.

to look for possible mistakes in the structure of these coefficient functions

a kinematical operator which acts just as the two-dimensional Galilean boost
generator in non-relativistic dynamics, it may provide some constraint on the
resulting structures. In this work we investigate the utility of Galilean
symmetry beyond tree level in the context of coupling constant renormalization
in light-front QCD using the two-component formalism. We show that for each

relative signs of terms in the coefficient functions accompanying the diverging

gives the asymptotic isometries of the black hole, and at the horizon it gives
an explicit form for a set of deformations of the horizon whose algebra is the

function by using a surface term at infinity that is compatible with fixing the

of the type IIB superstring theory. While the planar limit of the model is
known to reproduce the two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we find through Monte
Carlo simulation that the model allows a different large N limit, which can be
considered as the double scaling limit in matrix models.

assumed that W-algebras originating from the Hamiltonian reduction of an
SL(n,C)-bundle over a Riemann surface give rise to a flat connection, in which
the Beltrami differential may be identified. In this Letter, it is shown that
the use of the Beltrami parametrisation of complex structures on a compact
Riemann surface over which flat complex vector bundles are considered, allows
to construct the above mentioned flat connection. It is stressed that the
modulus of the Beltrami differential is of necessity less than one, and that
solutions of the so-called Beltrami equation give rise to an orientation
preserving smooth change of local complex coordinates. In particular, the
latter yields a smooth equivalence between flat complex vector bundles. The
role of smooth diffeomorphisms which induce equivalent complex structures is
specially emphasized. Furthermore, it is shown that, while the construction
given here applies to the special case of the Virasoro algebra, the extension
to flat complex vector bundles of arbitrary rank does not provide
""generalizations"" of the Beltrami differential usually considered as central
objects for such non-linear symmetries.

of local complex coordinates can be implemented with respect to an integrable
complex structure parametrized by a Beltrami differential. The question of
constructing a local field theory on a complex compact manifold is addressed
and the action of smooth diffeomorphisms is studied in the BRS algebraic
approach. The BRS cohomology for the diffeomorphisms gives rise to generalized
Gel'fand-Fuchs cocycles provided that the Kodaira-Spencer integrability

the formation of a partonic plasma.

dependence of the fidelity on the alignment parameters and on the statistical
evolution parameters characterizing the sequence correlations. Specific
criteria for the optimal choice of alignment parameters emerge from this
