  surface acoustic wave","some technical corrections for pictures were made",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  The heating of a two-dimensional electron gas by an rf electric field
generated by a surface acoustic wave, which can be described by an electron
temperature $T_e$, has been investigated. It is shown that the energy balance
of the electron gas is determined by electron scattering by the piezoelectric
potential of the acoustic phonons with $T_e$ determined from measurements at
frequencies $f$= 30 and 150 MHz. The experimental curves of the energy loss $Q$
versus $T_e$ at different SAW frequencies depend on the value of $\omega
\bar{\tau}_{\epsilon}$, compared to 1, where $ \bar {\tau}_{\epsilon}$ is the
relaxation time of the average electron energy. Theoretical calculations of the
heating of a two-dimensional electron gas by the electric field of the surface
acoustic wave are presented for the case of thermal electrons ($\Delta T \ll
T$). The calculations show that for the same energy losses $Q$ the degree of
heating of the two-dimensional electrons (i.e., the ratio $T_e/T$) for $\omega
\bar{\tau}_{\epsilon}>1$ ($f$= 150 MHz) is less than for $\omega
\bar{\tau}_{\epsilon}<1$ ($f$=30 MHz). Experimental results confirming this
calculation are presented.

  published in the Review of High Pressure Science and Technology",,,"cond-mat.str-el",,"  We report the NQR study on the pressure-induced paramagnetic state in the
antiferromagnetic (AF) intermetallic compound YMn$_2$ with the N\'eel
temperature T_N=100 K at ambient pressure. From the $T$ variation of the
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, $^{55}(1/T_1)$ of $^{55}$Mn above the
critical pressure of 4 kbar, the spin fluctuation feature is found to change
below a temperature $T_{sf}$. At higher temperature than $T_{sf}$, the nuclear
relaxation behavior is well described in terms of the self-consistent
renomalized (SCR) spin fluctuation theory for nearly AF metals, whereas below
$T_{sf}$ a deviation is significant and $1/T_1T$ exhibits a weak $T$ variation.
It is pointed out that $T_{sf}$ coincides with the temperature below which a
$T^{2}$ law in electrical resistivity is valid as expected for a Fermi liquid
ground state. We proposed that these features are understood from the
standpoint that the development of AF spin fluctuation remains in short-range
associated with the singlet formation among Mn spins in each tetrahedron as
suggested by the inelastic neutron experiments on $Y_{1-x}Sc_xMn_2$.

Q,star- ting from its certain boundary numbe Q*,are used in this paper for the

as a func- tion of their kinetic energies T in the lab. system for 4HeC and

arise out of higher dimensional operators needed to stabilize the charge

that the $\Delta B=2$ processes such as neutron-anti-neutron oscillation can
have observable rates while at the same time yielding neutrino masses in the

generally inherited from the IIB Green-Schwarz superstring action except
specific gauge choices which make the ground state massive, such as the static
