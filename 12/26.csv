neutron-star crust at densities (10^9 - 1.5x10^{14}) g/cm^3 is analyzed. The
processes taken into account are neutrino emission due to Coulomb scattering of
electrons by atomic nuclei in a Coulomb liquid, and electron-phonon scattering
and Bragg diffraction (the static-lattice contribution) in a Coulomb crystal.
The static-lattice contribution is calculated including the electron
band-structure effects for cubic Coulomb crystals of different types and also
for the liquid crystal phases composed of rod- and plate-like nuclei in the
neutron-star mantle (at 10^{14} - 1.5x10^{14} g/cm^3). The phonon contribution
is evaluated with proper treatment of the multi-phonon processes which removes
a jump in the neutrino bremsstrahlung emissivity at the melting point obtained
in previous works. Below 10^{13} g/cm^3, the results are rather insensitive to
the nuclear form factor, but results for the solid state near the melting point
are affected significantly by the Debye-Waller factor and multi-phonon
processes. At higher densities, the nuclear form factor becomes more
significant. A comparison of the various neutrino generation mechanisms in
neutron star crusts shows that electron bremsstrahlung is among the most
important ones.

years to annually monitor the broadband linear polarization of a sample of
bright northern Be stars. This is the fourth report on a program started in
1985 at McDonald Observatory and the first one to come entirely from the new
installation. Although no variability was detected at the 3-sigma level during
the current reporting period, analysis of the full 13-year data set is
beginning to reveal hints of long-term variability that may provide clues for
understanding the Be phenomenon.

their results to deduce that the model is behaving like in the droplet approach
and not like the mean-field theory. We show here, by using some unpublished
data, that this very interesting method and numerical results are completely
compatible with the behavior implied by the Replica Symmetry Breaking theory.

interpreted. This is done by using a new path equation other than the geodesic
one. It is shown that this discrepancy is possibly due to a type of interaction
between the torsion, of space-time generated by the background field, and the
spin of the moving neutron. The results obtained are discussed and compared
with the experimental interpretation suggested by Arif et al. in 1994. As a
byproduct, an upper limit is imposed on the free parameter of the new path
equation used.

foliation associated with the pencil. We also describe the algebra of functions
