input physics has been calculated for comparison with the old, metal-rich open
cluster NGC 6791. The isochrones have been simultaneously fit to BV and VI
color magnitude diagrams, with the same composition, reddening and distance
modulus required for both colors. Our best fitting isochrone assumes [Fe/H] =
+0.4, scaled solar abundance ratios, and dY/dZ = 2 (Y = 0.31), yielding an
excellent fit to the data at all points along the major sequences. The
resulting age is 8 Gyr, with E(B-V) = 0.10 and (m-M)_v = 13.42. The derived
cluster parameters are fairly robust to variations in the isochrone [Fe/H] and
helium abundances. All of the acceptable fits indicate that 0.07 < E(B-V) <
0.14$, 13.29 < (m-M)_v < 13.46, and that NGC 6791 has an age of 8.0+/- 0.5 Gyr.
The fits also suggest that dY/dZ lies between 1 and 3. A metallicity as low as
solar is clearly ruled out, as is dY/dZ = 0. Comparison with previous isochrone
studies indicates that the derived reddening is primarily due to our use of the
most recent color transformations, whereas the age depends upon both the colors
and the input physics. Our isochrones provide an excellent fit to the Hyades
zero-age main sequence as determined by Hipparcos, providing evidence that our
derived reddening and distance modulus are reliable.

are formed by plasma from the streamer that is swept up in the trough of the

observations from SOHO/LASCO. Additionally, we propose a thorough statistical

importance to modern cosmology; these studies, however, are hampered by the
complexity of the competing effects of spectral and density evolution.
Constructing a spectroscopic sample that is able to unambiguously disentangle
these processes is currently excessively prohibitive due to the observational
requirements. This paper extends and applies an alternative approach that
relies on statistical estimates for both distance (z) and spectral type to a
deep multi-band dataset that was obtained for this exact purpose.
  These statistical estimates are extracted directly from the photometric data
by capitalizing on the inherent relationships between flux, redshift, and
spectral type. These relationships are encapsulated in the empirical
photometric redshift relation which we extend to z ~ 1.2, with an intrinsic
dispersion of dz = 0.06. We also develop realistic estimates for the
photometric redshift error for individual objects, and introduce the
utilization of the galaxy ensemble as a tool for quantifying both a
cosmological parameter and its measured error. We present deep, multi-band,
optical number counts as a demonstration of the integrity of our sample. Using
the photometric redshift and the corresponding redshift error, we can divide
our data into different redshift intervals and spectral types. As an example
application, we present the number redshift distribution as a function of
spectral type.

that in which it is highly ionized and is at the Compton temperature ($\sim $
few keV). We show that this accounts for the difference in spectrum of GBHCs

disks, the magnetic energy transport can indeed power the corona in a way
consistent with observations, {\it if} magnetic field in the disk is mostly
contained to strong magnetic flux tubes. However, in radiation dominated disks
radiation diffusion makes the field weak/diffuse, and thus the magnetic energy
transport is less efficient, i.e., in such disks the disk intrinsic emission
should be the dominant component in the overall spectrum. We compare our
findings to observations, and conclude that our theory can account for the
often observed ``steeper when brighter'' behavior in AGN and the hard-soft

components to be consistent with classical theoretical models of binary cluster
formation (Fujimoto & Kumai 1997). We refer to this as the ``overmerging''

molecular complexes giving birth to groups of clusters over a few $10^7$ yr. In
these groups the expected cluster encounter rate is larger, and tidal capture
has higher probability. Cluster pairs are not born together through the
splitting of the parent cloud, but formed later by tidal capture. For 3 pairs,
we tentatively identify the star cluster group (SCG) memberships. The SCG
formation, through the recent cluster starburst triggered by the LMC-SMC

terms of T_c versus $1/\lambda_{\Vert}^{2}(T=0)$ will not tend to a straight
line with universal slope as the underdoped limit is approached. Implications

systems are derived from a macroscopic formalism. The full tensorial structure
of the transport coefficients and the effect of the sample boundaries are

microscopic model relevant for multi-valleyed materials is introduced which
utilizes the effective-mass and relaxation-time approximations. The thermopower
and Lorentz number are independent of the tensorial structure of the transport

vanishing lattice thermal conductivity \kappa_\ell. For non-vanishing but
sufficiently isotropic \kappa_\ell, ZT is maximal along the direction of
highest electrical conductivity \sigma. Numerical calculations suggest that
maximal ZT generally occurs along the principal direction with the largest
\sigma/\kappa_\ell. An explicit bound on ZT is derived. Several results for
specific systems are obtained: (1) Bulk n-type Bi_2Te_3 exhibits easily
observable induced transverse fields and anisotropic ZTs. (2) Increased
anisotropy in HgTe/ Hg_{1-x}Cd_xTe superlattices (SLs) is associated with
larger induced fields. (3) The valley degeneracy is split and the bulk masses
modified in isolated Bi_2Te_3 quantum wells, resulting in optimal ZTs for wells
grown along the trigonal direction. (4) Non-parabolic dispersion in SLs has
little effect on the thermopower at the carrier concentrations which maximize

biaxial nematic-director fluctuation modes, located in the domain occupied by

orientational order promote the existence of uniaxial nematic-director local

exciations are strongly softened as compared to their bulk counterparts and
acquire characteristic cusplike low-energy spectra. These spectrum

dwell in the strong gravitational field near the event horizon of the black
hole. The role of string tension is also investigated by comparing the

a perturbation with axial parity. Similarly (as we show here) rotating stars of
this kind have no pure g-modes, no modes whose spherical limit is a
perturbation with polar parity and vanishing perturbed pressure and density.
Where have these modes gone?
  In spherical stars of this kind, r-modes and g-modes form a degenerate
zero-frequency subspace. We find that rotation splits the degeneracy to zeroth
order in the star's angular velocity $\Omega$, and the resulting modes are
generically hybrids, whose limit as $\Omega\to 0$ is a stationary current with
axial and polar parts. Because each mode has definite parity, its axial and
polar parts have alternating values of $l$. We show that each mode belongs to
one of two classes, axial-led or polar-led, depending on whether the spherical
harmonic with lowest value of $l$ that contributes to its velocity field is
axial or polar. We numerically compute these modes for slowly rotating
polytropes and for Maclaurin spheroids, using a straightforward method that
appears to be novel and robust. Timescales for the gravitational-wave driven
instability and for viscous damping are computed using assumptions appropriate
to neutron stars.

AdS_3 has an infinite-dimensional symmetry group forming a Virasoro algebra.
More recently, Giveon, Kutasov and Seiberg (GKS) constructed the corresponding
Virasoro generators in the first-quantized string theory on AdS_3. In this
paper, we explore various aspects of string theory on AdS_3 and study the
relation between these two works. We show how semi-classical properties of the
string theory reproduce many features of the AdS/CFT duality. Furthermore, we
examine how the Virasoro symmetry of Brown and Henneaux is realized in string
theory, and show how it leads to the Virasoro Ward identities of the boundary
CFT. The Virasoro generators of GKS emerge naturally in this analysis. Our work
clarifies several aspects of the GKS construction: why the Brown-Henneaux
Virasoro algebra can be realized on the first-quantized Hilbert space, to what
extent the free-field approximation is valid, and why the Virasoro generators
act on the string worldsheet localized near the boundary of AdS_3. On the other
hand, we find that the way the central charge of the Virasoro algebra is
generated is different from the mechanism proposed by GKS.

density matrix representation); definitions for all observable quantities are
given and the values associated to the ""particle"" solutions are the correct
ones, both for the non-relativistic and the relativistic case. Finally, a
non-linear interaction (the electromagnetic one) is introduced in an attempt to
single out the ""particle"" solutions of the Dirac equation from all other
solutions; the dynamical evolution of the electromagnetic field is described by
the classical (unquantized) Maxwell equations.
