between an elliptical and a small disk galaxy. Simulations of the stellar
component have shown that the shells are created either by ``phase-wrapping''
of debris on nearly radial orbits (Quinn 1984), or by ``spatial-wrapping'' of
matter in thin disks (Dupraz & Combes 1987; Hernquist & Quinn 1989; Quillen
etal 1993). However, recent HI observations of several shell galaxies
(Schiminovich etal 1994, 1995) revealed the presence of gaseous shells
displaced from the stellar ones, which questioned the validity of the
``phase-wrapping'' mechanism. Our numerical simulations indicate that these new
observations can actually be accommodated within the standard picture for the
formation of shell galaxies.

(NS-BH) binary, oscillation modes of the NS can be resonantly excited by the
companion during the final minutes of the inspiral. The resonant energy
transfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and
induces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A
tidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the
orbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS
must have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance
and nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,
these spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal
coupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital
cycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for
(33,3)- resonance. Such resonant effects, if present, must be included in
constructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wave
signals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but
N_orb<0.1. For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation
(nu_s<100Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonance
to a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling, N_orb
lies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the NS EOS) and is probably
negligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. R-mode resonances
require misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances
correspond to (22,3) and (22,1). Since tidal coupling depends strongly on
rotation rate, N_orb<10^-2(R/10km)^(10)(M/1.4Mo)^(-20/3) is negligible for
canonical NS parameters but can be appreciable if the NS radius is larger.

evolution of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, consisting of equal amounts of
carbon and oxygen, from the onset of violent thermonuclear burning, by means of
a new two-dimensional numerical code. Since in the interior of such a massive
white dwarf nuclear burning progresses on microscopic scales as a sharp
discontinuity, a so-called flamelet, which cannot be resolved by any numerical
scheme, and since on macroscopic scales the burning front propagates due to
turbulence, we make an attempt to model both effects explicitly in the
framework of a finite-volume hydrodynamics code. Turbulence is included by a
sub-grid model, following the spirit of large eddy simulations, and the
well-localized burning front is treated by means of a level set, which allows
us to compute the geometrical structure of the front more accurately than with
previous methods. The only free parameters of our simulations are the location
and the amount of nuclear fuel that is ignited as an initial perturbation. We
find that models in which explosive carbon burning is ignited at the center
remain bound by the time the front reaches low densities, where we stopped the
computations because our description of combustion is no longer applicable. In
contrast, off-center ignition models give rise to explosions which, however,
are still too weak for typical Type Ia supernovae. Possible reasons for this
rather disappointing result are discussed.

fundamental frequencies (in the radial and azimuthal directions) for test
particle motion in the gravitational field of the neutron star, for reasonable
star masses, and nearly independent of the star spin. The radial frequency must
be much smaller than the azimuthal one, testifying that kHz QPOs are produced
close to the innermost stable orbit. These results are not reproduced through

numerically to the Wigner Band Random Matrix model. The perturbation theory
tells that a perturbed energy eigenstate can be divided into a perturbative
part and a non-perturbative part with the perturbative part expressed as a
perturbation expansion. Numerically it is found that such a division is
important in understanding many properties of both eigenstates and the
so-called local spectral density of states (LDOS). For the average shape of
eigenstates, its central part is found to be composed of its non-perturbative
part and a region of its perturbative part, which is close to the
non-perturbative part. A relationship between the average shape of eigenstates
and that of LDOS can be explained. Numerical results also show that the
transition for the average shape of LDOS from the Breit-Wigner form to the
semicircle form is related to a qualitative change in some properties of the
perturbation expansion of the perturbative parts of eigenstates. The transition
for the half-width of the LDOS from quadratic dependence to linear dependence
on the perturbation strength is accompanied by a transition of a similar form
for the average size of the non-perturbative parts of eigenstates. For both
transitions, the same critical perturbation strength $\lambda_b$ has been found
to play important roles. When perturbation strength is larger than $\lambda_b$,
the average shape of LDOS obeys an approximate scaling law.

isotropize fully anisotropic solutions whose scale factors describe accelerated

the string phase. We follow the fate of the shear parameter in a decelerated
phase where, dilaton, magnetic fields and radiation fluid are simultaneously
present. In the absence of any magnetic field a long string phase immediately
followed by radiation is able to erase large anisotropies. Conversely, if a
short string phase is followed by a long dilaton dominated phase the
anisotropies can be present, in principle, also at later times. The presence of
magnetic seeds after the end of the string phase can induce further
anisotropies which can be studied within the formalism reported in this paper.

isovector reggeons in inclusive production of nucleons and Delta isobars in

pion-exchange induced mechanism of $\Delta$ production and provides a
constraint on the $\pi N \Delta$ form factor. The production of leading pions
in proton-proton collisions at ISR puts additional constraints on the $\pi NN$

a negligible contribution to the proton structure function from DIS off the
exchanged $\rho,a_2$ reggeons. All these constraints are used then to estimate
the pion content of the nucleon and allow to calculate parameter-free the

photoelectron spectra of Cs atoms subject to intense chirped laser pulses, with
gaussian beams. We include above threshold ionization spectral peaks. The
frequency of the laser is near resonance with the 6s-7p transition. Dominant
couplings are included exactly, weaker ones accounted for perturbatively. We
calculate the relevant transition matrix elements, including spin-orbit
coupling. The pulse is taken to be a hyperbolic secant in time and the chirping
a hyperbolic tangent. This choice allows the equations of motions for the
probability amplitudes to be solved analytically as a series expansion in the
variable u=(tanh(pi t/tau)+1)/2, where tau is a measure of the pulse length. We
find that the chirping changes the ionization dynamics and the photoelectron
spectra noticeably, especially for longer pulses of the order of 10^4 a.u. The
peaks shift and change in height, and interference effects between the 7p
levels are enhanced or diminished according to the amount of chirping and its
sign. The integrated ionization probability is not strongly affected.

and interact by Coulomb repulsion. Sideband cooling in the Lamb-Dicke regime is
shown to work analogously to sideband cooling of a single ion. Outside the
Lamb-Dicke regime, the incommensurable frequencies of the two vibrational modes
result in a quasi-continuous energy spectrum that significantly alters the
cooling dynamics. The cooling time decreases nonlinearly with the linewidth of
the cooling transition, and the effect of trapping states which may slow down
the cooling is considerably reduced. We show that cooling to the ground state
is possible also outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. We develop the model and use
Quantum Monte Carlo calculations for specific examples. We show that a rate
equation treatment is a good approximation in all cases.

features) results from the interaction of the system with the environment, and
is well described in the framework of the theory of continuous quantum
measurements (CQM). Reviewed are the various approaches to the CQM theory, and
the approach based on the effective complex Hamiltonians is discussed in
greater detail. The effective complex Hamiltonian is derived from the
restricted path integral, which emphasizes the role of information in the
dynamics of the system being measured. The complex Hamiltonian is used for
analyzing the CQM of energy in a two-level system. Such measurement is
demonstrated to be capable of monitoring the quantum transition, and the back
effect of monitoring on the probability of transition is analyzed. The
realization of this type of measurement by a long series of soft observations
of the system is presented.
