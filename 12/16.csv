collide with the infalling gas and produce the super-shell in which stars are

bubble is blown by stellar winds from the O-type stars in the association. The
Kompaneets approximation is adapted to model a wind-blown bubble in a
stratified interstellar medium. We describe some general principles necessary
for understanding the dynamics of an expanding bubble and the associated
ionization structure in a stratified atmosphere. The Kompaneets model can be
used to determine the mean scale height of the ambient medium as well as the
age of the bubble. The ionization structure also places constraints on the
ambient density near the cluster. We also estimate the surface brightness of
the shell and the fraction of ionizing photons which escape the bubble. The
prescription we use can be applied to any observed bubble that is blown by the
effectively continuous energy output of stellar winds or multiple supernovae.
Application to the W4 superbubble shows that the mean scale height of the
ambient gas around the cluster is remarkably small, 25 pc for a cluster
distance of 2.35 kpc. The age of the bubble is estimated to be about 2.5 Myr,
consistent with the notion that the bubble is blown by stellar winds from a
very young cluster in which no supernovae have yet occurred.

ionization state, chemical abundances, and kinematic characteristics of two
metal-line systems at z=1.92 and z=1.94 toward J2233-606. We focus on these two
systems because (i) the observations provide full coverage of the Lyman series,
hence an accurate determination of their HI column densities and (ii) the
metal-line transitions allow a measurement of their ionization state.
  Line-profile fits of the Lyman series for the two systems indicate log N(HI)
= 17.15 \pm 0.02 cm^-2 evenly distributed between two components for the z=1.92
system and log N(HI) = 16.33 \pm 0.04 cm^-2 for the z=1.94 system. By comparing
observed ionic ratios of C and Si against calculations performed with the
CLOUDY software package, we find the ionization state is high and well
constrained in both systems. Applying ionization corrections to the measured
ionic column densities, we determine that the systems exhibit significantly
different metallicities: ~ 1/50 solar and < 1/200 solar for the two components
of z=1.92 and ~40% solar at z=1.94. The properties of the z=1.92 system are
consistent with a low metallicity galaxy (e.g. a dwarf galaxy) as well as
absorption by large scale structure of the IGM. On the other hand, the high
metallicity of the z=1.94 system suggests significant star formation and is
therefore most likely associated with a galactic system. Furthermore, we
predict it is the most likely to be observed with the STIS imaging and
follow-up observations. If a galaxy is identified, our results provide direct

field of the globular cluster M55. We have discovered nine new RR Lyrae stars,
increasing the number of known variables in this cluster to 15 objects. Five of
the newly discovered variables belong to Bailey type RRc and two to type RRab.
Two background RRab stars are probable members of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.
Fourier decomposition of the light curves was used to derive basic properties
of the present sample of RR Lyrae variables. From an analysis of the RRc
variables we obtain a mean mass of $M=0.53\pm0.03 M_\odot$, luminosity $\log
L=1.75\pm0.01$, effective temperature $T_{eff}=7193\pm27$ K, and helium
abundance $Y=0.27\pm0.01$. Based on the $B-V$ colors, periods and metallicities
of the RRab stars we estimate the value of the color excess for M55 to be equal
to $E(B-V)=0.11\pm0.03$. Using this value we derive the colors of the blue and
red edges of the instability strip in M55. The blue edge lies at $(B-V)_0=0.20$
mag and the red edge lies at $(B-V)_0=0.38$ mag. We estimate the values of the
visual apparent and dereddened distance moduli to be $13.65\pm0.11$ and
$13.31\pm0.11$, respectively. The light curves of three of the RRc variables
exhibit changes in amplitude of over 0.1 mag on the time scale of less than a
week, rather short for the Blazhko effect, but with no evidence for another
radial pulsational frequency. However we do detect other periodicities which
are clearly visible in the light curve after removing variations with the first
overtone radial frequency. This is strong evidence for the presence of
non-radial pulsations, a behavior common for $\delta$ Scuti stars but not yet
observed among RR Lyr variables.

Rees","Reionization of the Inhomogeneous Universe","to be published in The Astrophysical Journal","Astrophys.J. 530 (2000) 1-16","10.1086/308330",,"astro-ph",,"  A model of the density distribution in the intergalactic medium, motivated by
that found in numerical simulations, is used to demonstrate the effect of a
clumpy IGM and discrete sources on the reionization of the universe. In an
inhomogeneous universe reionization occurs outside-in, starting in voids and
gradually penetrating into overdense regions. Reionization should not be sudden
but gradual, with a continuous rise of the photon mean free path over a fair
fraction of the Hubble time as the emissivity increases. We show that a
hydrogen Gunn-Peterson trough should be present at $z\simeq 6$ unless the
emissivity increases with redshift at $z>4$. However, the epoch of overlap of
cosmological \hii regions could have occurred at a higher redshift if sources
of low luminosity reionized the IGM; the Gunn-Peterson trough at $z\sim 6$
would then appear because even the most underdense voids have a large enough
neutral fraction in ionization equilibrium to be optically thick to \lya
photons. Cosmological \hii regions near the epoch of overlap can produce gaps
of transmitted flux only if luminous quasars contributed to the reionization.
Despite the clumpiness of the matter distribution, recombinations are not very
important during the reionization of hydrogen because the high density gas is
not ionized until a late time. We show that the \heii reionization was most
likely delayed relative to the hydrogen reionization, but should be completed
by $z\sim 3$, the redshift where observations are available. The reported large
optical depth fluctuations of \heii are probably not due to an incomplete \heii
reionization, but arise from a combination of density fluctuations and the
variations in the intensity of the ionizing background due to luminous QSO's.

contrast with those of our predecessors. In particular, we completely revise
previous calculations of the lower critical field and refute the concept of a
triangular Josephson vortex lattice. We show that Josephson vortices penetrate
into all the barriers simultaneously and form peculiar structures that we term
''vortex planes''. We calculate the superheating field of the Meissner state
and predict hysteresis in the magnetization. In the vortex state, the
magnetization exhibits distinctive oscillatory behavior and jumps due to
successive penetration of the vortex planes. We prove that the vortex-plane
penetration and pinning by the edges of the sample cause the Fraunhofer pattern
of the critical Josephson current. We calculate the critical temperature and
the upper critical field of infinite (along the layers) multilayers. For finite
multilayers, we predict a series of first-order phase transitions to the normal

formula for the entropy of massless radiation valid either for black-hole or
for acceleration horizons is derived. It is argued that, as a black hole
horizon in the limit under consideration turns into an acceleration one, the
thermodynamic entropy $S_{q}$ of quantum radiation is due to the Unruh effect
entirely and $S_{q}=0$ exactly. The contribution to the quasilocal energy from
a given curved spacetime is equal to zero and the only nonvanishing term stems
from a reference metric. In the variation procedure necessary for the
derivation of the general first law, the metric on a horizon surface changes
along with the boundary one, and the account for gravitational and matter
stresses is an essential ingredient of the first law. This law confirms the
property $S_{q}=0$. The quantum-corrected geometry of the Bertotti - Robinson

the effect of the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{eff\text{}}$ and can
drastically change the character of spacetime depending on the sign of $\Lambda

exponents of the leading power corrections to various observables. Any viable
dynamical framework is to reproduce this pattern of the power corrections. In
this mini-review, we emphasize that a simple dynamical framework satisfying
this requirement may well be provided by the strings inherent to the Abelian
Higgs model. This model comes naturally into consideration within the U(1)
projection of QCD which makes explicit the dual-superconductor model of the
confinement. At large distances (compared to $\LQ^{-1}$) there are
Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen strings which develop a characteristic
non-perturbative transverse size of order $\LQ^{-1}$ and match in this way the
infrared renormalons. At short distances there are no ANO strings but there
still exist dynamical manifestations of the stringy topological condition that
(external) quarks are connected by a mathematically thin line along which the
vacuum is trivial. These manifestations may match ultraviolet renormalons.

results in their context, asking what the implications to other issues in
computer science and physics are. In the end of this review I make these
connections explicit, discussing the possible implications of quantum
computation on fundamental physical questions, such as the transition from
quantum to classical physics.

an unitary operator is shown to transform the quantum states of the system to
those of a harmonic oscillator system of unit mass and time-dependent
frequency, as well as operators. For a driven harmonic oscillator, it is also
shown that, there are unitary transformations which give the driven system from
the system of same mass and frequency without driving force. The transformation
for a driven oscillator depends on the solution of classical equation of motion
of the driven system. These transformations, thus, give a simple way of finding
exact wave functions of a driven harmonic oscillator system, provided the
quantum states of the corresponding system of unit mass are given.

Hamiltonian $H=p^2+{1/4}x^2+i \lambda x^3$, is performed using high-order
Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger perturbation theory. The energy spectrum of this
Hamiltonian has recently been shown to be real using numerical methods. The
Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger perturbation series is Borel summable, and Pad\'e
summation provides excellent agreement with the real energy spectrum. Pad\'e
analysis provides strong numerical evidence that the once-subtracted
ground-state energy considered as a function of $\lambda^2$ is a Stieltjes
function. The analyticity properties of this Stieltjes function lead to a
dispersion relation that can be used to compute the imaginary part of the
energy for the related real but unstable Hamiltonian $H=p^2+{1/4}x^2-\epsilon
x^3$.

associated with these two nonstandard super Lax hierarchies, we obtain the
