from a compact and erratically variable source in the nucleus. The observed
time delays, 0.1-2 days for the continuum, 1-100 days for the broad emission
lines, probe regions only micro-arcseconds away from the nucleus. The continuum
time delays map the temperature-radius profiles of the AGN accretion discs. The
emission-line delays reveal radially stratified ionization zones, identify the
nature of the gas motions, and estimate the masses of the central black holes.
By using light travel time to measure the sizes of AGN accretion discs and

  Smith",,"10.1063/1.58626",,"astro-ph",,"  Recently we have elaborated a new cosmological model of gamma-ray burst (GRB)
origin (1998, ApJ 502, 192), which employs the dynamical evolution of central
dense stellar clusters in the galactic nuclei. Those clusters inevitably
contain a large fraction of compact stellar remnants (CSRs), such as neutron
stars (NSs) and stellar mass black holes (BHs), and close encounters between
them result in radiative captures into short-living binaries, with subsequent
merging of the components, thereby producing GRBs (typically at large distances
from the nucleus).
  In the present paper, we calculate the redshift distribution of the rate of
GRBs produced by close encounters of NSs in distant galactic nuclei. To this
end, the following steps are undertaken: (i) we establish a connection between
the parameters of the fast evolving central stellar clusters (i.e. those for
which the time of dynamical evolution exceeds the age of the Universe) with
masses of the forming central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using a
dynamical evolution model; (ii) we connect these masses with the inferred mass
distributions of SMBHs in the galactic nuclei and the redshift distribution of
quasars by assuming a certain `Eddington luminosity phase' in their activity;
(iii) we incorporate available observational data on the redshift distribution
of quasars as well as a recently found correlation between the masses of
galaxies and their central SMBHs. The resulting redshift distribution of the
GRB rate, which accounts for both fast and slowly evolving galactic nuclei is
consistent with that inferred from the BATSE data if the fraction of fast
evolving galactic nuclei is in the range $0.016-0.16$.

calculate the detailed consequences of such scaling. We generalise the

predictions are confronted with {\it Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) star count

studied using a simple ansatz for the variation in the color-magnitude relation
with position and while it is shown to lead to better agreement with the star

to the disk, and we consider two different field topologies (with and without
tension effects): parallel and perpendicular to the plane of motion of the
clouds. The impinging clouds move in oblique trajectories and fall toward the
central disk with different initial velocities. The $B$-field lines are
distorted and compressed during the collision, increasing the field pressure
and tension. This prevents the cloud material from penetrating into the disk,
and can even transform a high-velocity inflow into an outflow, moving away from
the disk. The perturbation creates a complex, turbulent, pattern of MHD waves
that are able to traverse the disk of the Galaxy, and induce oscillations on
both sides of the plane. Thus, the magnetic field efficiently transmits the
perturbation over a large volume, but also acts like a shield that inhibits the
mass exchange between the halo and the disk. For the non-magnetized cases, we
also uncover some novel features: the evolution of the shocked layer generates
a tail that oscillates, creating vorticity and turbulent flows along its

We show that this star closely resembles a remnant of early massive Case B
evolution, during which the neutron star ejected most of the $\sim 3\msun$
transferred from the donor (initial mass $M_{\rm 2i}\sim 3.6\msun$) on its
thermal time-scale $\sim 10^6$ yr. As the system is far too wide to result from
common-envelope evolution, this strongly supports the idea that a neutron star
efficiently ejects the excess inflow during super--Eddington mass transfer.
Cygnus X-2 is unusual in having had an initial mass ratio $q_{\rm i} = M_{\rm
2i}/M_1$ in a narrow critical range near $q_{\rm i}\simeq 2.6$. Smaller $q_{\rm
i}$ lead to long-period systems with the former donor near the Hayashi line,
and larger $q_{\rm i}$ to pulsar binaries with shorter periods and relatively
massive white dwarf companions. The latter naturally explain the surprisingly
large companion masses in several millisecond pulsar binaries. Systems like

still significant variations (a factor of 2). In contrast, no variation was
detected in the strong broad MgII+UV FeII emission-line complex. While
historically the flux in the broad MgII emission line has varied (a factor of 2
within a few years), the profile shape has not been observed to change over the
past decade. In contrast, the high ionization lines (HILs) show both
emission-line flux and profile changes on relatively short timescales, which
appear to be correlated with changes in the continuum level. Significantly, on
1996, February 21, the profile shapes of the HILs (e.g. Ly-alpha, CIV) and low

Einstein Observatory Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey (EMSS) that are
observable from Mauna Kea (dec > -40deg). The sample spans a redshift range of
0.15 < z < 0.823 and includes 5 clusters with z > 0.5. CCD images of the
clusters were obtained in excellent seeing. There is evidence of strong
gravitational lensing in the form of giant arcs (length l > 8'', axis ratio l/w
> 10) in 8 of the 38 clusters. Two additional clusters contain shorter arclets,
and 6 more clusters contain candidate arcs that require follow-up observations
to confirm their lensing origin. Since the survey does not have a uniform
surface brightness limit we do not draw any conclusion based on the statistics
of the arcs found. We note, however, that 60% (3 of 5) of the clusters with Lx
> 10^{45} erg s^{-1}, and none of the 15 clusters with Lx < 4x10^{44} erg
s^{-1} contain giant arcs, thereby confirming that high X-ray luminosity does
identify the most massive systems, and thus X-ray selection is the preferred
method for finding true, rich clusters at intermediate and high redshifts. The
observed geometry of the arcs, most of which are thin, have large axis ratios
(l/w > 10), and are aligned orthogonal to the optical major axes of the
clusters, indicate the cluster core mass density profiles must be compact
(steeper than isothermal). In several cases, however, there is also some
evidence, in the form of possible radial arcs, for density profiles with finite
core radii.

keep some mobility, but this mobility must be compatible with the local

level (LL) flattening can be discarded. The profile of the unperturbed electron
density is sharp and the dissipation taken into account comes only from
electron intra-edge and intra-LL transitions due to scattering by acoustic
phonons. For wide channels and filling factors $\nu =1$ and 2, there exist
independent EMP modes spatially symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to the
edge. Some of these modes, named edge helicons, can propagate nearly undamped
even when the dissipation is strong. Their density profile changes
qualitatively during propagation and is given by a rotation of a complex vector
function. For $\nu >2,$ the Coulomb coupling between the LLs leads to a
repulsion of the uncoupled fundamental LL modes: the new modes have very
different group velocities and are nearly undamped. The theory accounts well
for the experimentally observed plateau structure of the delay times as well as

is inserted in d=2 by effectively tuning the couplings to a few short-ranged
lattice paths, based on the behavior of topological zero modes. We simulate the
Schwinger model with this action, applying a new variant of Hybrid Monte Carlo,
which damps the computational overhead due to the non-standard couplings. We
obtain a tiny ``pion'' mass down to very small \beta, while the ``\eta'' mass

describe the work done on the multibaryon minima using rational maps, on the

gauge coupling unification is as precise (at one loop) as in the MSSM, and
occurs in the TeV range. One of the key ingredients of this model is the
presence of new states neutral under $SU(3)_c\otimes SU(2)_w$ but charged under
$U(1)_Y$ whose mass scale is around that of the electroweak Higgs doublets. In
this paper we show that introduction of these states allows to gauge novel
anomaly free discrete (as well as continuous) symmetries (similar to ``lepton''
and ``baryon'' numbers) which suppress dangerous higher dimensional operators
and stabilize proton. Moreover, we argue that these gauge symmetries are
essential for successfully generating small neutrino masses via a recently
proposed higher dimensional mechanism. Furthermore, the mass hierarchy between
the up and down quarks (e.g., $t$ vs. $b$) can be explained without appealing
to large $\tan\beta$, and the $\mu$-term for the electroweak Higgs doublets (as
well as for the new states) can be generated. We also discuss various
phenomenological implications of our model which lead to predictions testable
in the present or near future collider experiments. In particular, we point out
that signatures of scenarios with high vs. low unification (string) scale might
be rather different. This suggest a possibility that the collider experiments
may distinguish between these scenarios even without a direct production of
heavy Kaluza-Klein or string states.

Gibbs formalism applied on the level of space-time histories. The assumptions
(chaoticity principle) underlying the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem make
it possible, using symbolic dynamics, to employ the theory of one-dimensional
lattice spin systems. The Kurchan and Lebowitz-Spohn analysis of this
fluctuation theorem for stochastic dynamics can be restated on the level of the
space-time measure which is a Gibbs measure for an interaction determined by
the transition probabilities. In this note we understand the fluctuation
theorem as a Gibbs property as it follows from the very definition of Gibbs
state. We give a local version of the fluctuation theorem in the Gibbsian
context and we derive from this a version also for some class of spatially
extended stochastic dynamics.
