provide estimates of its hot young star population. Our approach differs from
previous investigations in that we are able to distinguish between the regions
in which different infrared fine-structure lines form, using complementary
ground-based observations. The high excitation nebular [SIV] emission is formed
in a very compact region, which we attribute to the central super-star-nucleus,
and lower excitation [NeII] nebular emission originates in the galactic core.
We use photo-ionization modelling coupled with the latest theoretical O-star
flux distributions to derive effective stellar temperatures and ionization
parameters of Teff>38kK, logQ=8.25 for the compact nucleus, with Teff=35kK,
logQ<8 for the larger core. Results are supported by more sophisticated
calculations using evolutionary synthesis models. We assess the contribution
that Wolf-Rayet stars may make to highly ionized nebular lines (e.g. [OIV]).
  From our Br(alpha) flux, the 2"" nucleus contains the equivalent of
approximately 1000 O7V star equivalents and the starburst there is 2-3Myr old;
the 20"" core contains about 2500 O7V star equivalents, with a representative
age of 5Myr. The Lyman ionizing flux of the nucleus is equivalent to the 30
Doradus region. These quantities are in good agreement with the observed mid-IR
dust luminosity of 7.8x10^8 L(sun) Since this structure of hot clusters
embedded in cooler emission may be common in dwarf starbursts, observing a
galaxy solely with a large aperture may result in confusion. Neglecting the
spatial distribution of nebular emission in NGC5253, implies `global' stellar
temperatures (or ages) of 36kK (4.8Myr) and 39kK (2.9 or 4.4Myr) from the

galaxy luminosity functions that are consistent with both source counts at
2800, 850, 450 and and 175 microns, and far-infrared background radiation

luminosities >= 10^12 L_sun. As for many local ULIGs it is not possible to
determine whether these luminous galaxies are powered by starbursts, like the
local galaxy Arp 220, or by active galactic nuclei (AGN), like the local galaxy
Markarian 231. If the submillimetre-luminous galaxies are all starbursts, then
we predict that the fraction of the cosmic star-formation rate in these objects
is large, but but does not necessarily dominate the star-formation rate of the
Universe at any redshift. Only a few per cent by mass of the present-epoch
spheroidal stellar population would have been formed in such a population of
star-forming galaxies, consistent with constraints on the number of galaxies
with old stellar populations in the field at low and intermediate redshift
derived from K-band surves. If the submillimetre-luminous galaxies are all

for the observed distributions of recession velocity, apparent magnitude,
angular offset, and projected radial distance between the supernova and the

includes biases due to the flux-limited nature of the survey, the different
light curve morphologies displayed by different SNe Ia, and the difficulty of
finding events projected near the central regions of the host galaxies. From
these simulations we estimate the bias in the zero-point and slope of the
absolute magnitude-decline rate relation used in SNe Ia distance measurements.
For an assumed intrinsic scatter of 0.15 mag about this relation, these
selection effects decrease the zero-point by 0.04 mag. The slope of the
relation is not significantly biased. We conclude that despite selection
effects in the survey, the shape and zero-point of the relation determined from
the Calan/Tololo sample are quite reliable. We estimate the degree of
incompleteness of the survey as a function of decline rate and estimate a
corrected luminosity function for SNe Ia in which the frequency of SNe appears
to increase with decline rate (the fainter SNe are more common). Finally, we
compute the integrated detection efficiency of the survey in order to infer the
rate of SNe Ia from the 31 events found. For a value of Ho=65 km/sec/Mpc we
obtain a SN Ia rate of 0.21(+0.30)(-0.13) SNu. This is in good agreement with

$\omega \tau_c \approx 1$ for the $n=1$ mode. Here $\omega$ is radian frequency
and $\tau_c$ is about four times the thermal timescale at the bottom of the
surface convection zone. As a ZZ Ceti cools, its convection zone deepens,
longer period modes become overstable, but the critical value of $\omega\tau_c$
separating overstable and damped modes rises. The latter is a consequence of
enhanced radiative damping for modes which propagate immediately below the
convection zone. The critical value of $\omega\tau_c$ is of observational
significance because modes with the smallest value of $\omega\tau_c$ are most
observable photometrically. Maximum periods for overstable modes predicted for
our cooler model envelopes are about a factor two longer than the observational

promising. The nonadiabatic eigenfunctions enable us to predict relative

Like other radiative SNRs, this object is characterized by prominent
line-emitting filaments and relatively strong IRAS 12 and 25 micron emission
which is commonly interpreted as thermal radiation from very small grains
stochastically heated by collisions with the hot plasma behind the shock front.
This interpretation is challenged by the data presented in this Letter which
indicate that most of the 12 and 25 micron IRAS flux is accounted for by
ionized line emission (mainly [NeII] and [FeII]). This result also seems to
hold for other radiative SNRs. We also discuss the possible contribution of H_2
lines to the IRAS 12 micron flux from the southern rim of IC443 and briefly
analyze the element abundances derived from the observed ionic lines.

those structures which are induced in quantum eigenstates by unstable periodic

mechanics of the billiard in the triaxial ellipsoid is investigated. The system
is separable in ellipsoidal coordinates. A smooth description of the motion is
given in terms of a geodesic flow on a solid torus, which is a fourfold cover
of the interior of the ellipsoid. Two crossing separatrices lead to four
generic types of motion. The action variables of the system are integrals of a
single Abelian differential of second kind on a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.
The classical separability carries over to quantum mechanics giving two
versions of generalized Lam{\'e} equations according to the two sets of
classical coordinates. The quantum eigenvalues define a lattice when
transformed to classical action space. Away from the separatrix surfaces the
lattice is given by EBK quantization rules for the four types of classical
motion. The transition between the four lattices is described by a uniform
semiclassical quantization scheme based on a WKB ansatz. The tunneling between
tori is given by penetration integrals which again are integrals of the same
Abelian differential that gives the classical action variables. It turns out
that the quantum mechanics of ellipsoidal billiards is semiclassically most
elegantly explained by the investigation of its hyperelliptic curve and the
real and purely imaginary periods of a single Abelian differential.

lattice and we study its finite size scaling behavior. Bootstrap percolation is
an example of Cellular Automata defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice
$\{1,2,...,L\}^d$ in which each site can be empty or occupied by a single
particle; in the starting configuration each site is occupied with probability
$p$, occupied sites remain occupied for ever, while empty sites are occupied by
a particle if at least $\ell$ among their $2d$ nearest neighbor sites are
occupied. When $d$ is fixed, the most interesting case is the one $\ell=d$:
this is a sort of threshold, in the sense that the critical probability $p_c$
for the dynamics on the infinite lattice ${\Bbb Z}^d$ switches from zero to one
when this limit is crossed. Finite size effects in the three-dimensional case
are already known in the cases $\ell\le 2$: in this paper we discuss the case
$\ell=3$ and we show that the finite size scaling function for this problem is
of the form $f(L)={\mathrm{const}}/\ln\ln L$. We prove a conjecture proposed by
A.C.D. van Enter.

shown to appear so as to complement the fermion anti-fermion condensate, which
breaks the flavor U(2N) symmetry and causes fermion mass generation. The
solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson gap equation show that the fermion self-energy
contributes to the induction of a finite fermion density and/or fermion mass.
The magnetization can be supported by charge condensation for theories with the
Chern-Simons coefficient $\kappa=N e^2/2 \pi$, and $\kappa=N e^2/4 \pi$, under
the Gauss law constraint. For $\kappa=N e^2/4 \pi$, both the magnetic field and
the fermion mass are simultaneously generated in the half-filled ground state,
which breaks the U(2N) symmetry as well as the Lorentz symmetry.

connection really useful? The answer to these questions leads to a new and
unifying approach to the theory of random matrices. Introducing an appropriate
time t-dependence in the probability distribution of the matrix ensemble, leads
to vertex operator expressions for the n-point correlation functions
(probabilities of n eigenvalues in infinitesimal intervals) and the
corresponding Fredholm determinants (probabilities of no eigenvalue in a Borel
subset E); the latter probability is a ratio of tau-functions for the
KP-equation, whose numerator satisfy partial differential equations, which
decouple into the sum of two parts: a Virasoro-like part depending on time only
and a Vect(S^1)-part depending on the boundary points A_i of E. Upon setting
t=0, and using the KP-hierarchy to eliminate t-derivatives, these PDE's lead to
a hierarchy of non-linear PDE's, purely in terms of the A_i. These PDE's are
nothing else but the KP hierarchy for which the t-partials, viewed as commuting
operators, are replaced by non-commuting operators in the endpoints A_i of the
E under consideration. When the boundary of E consists of one point and for the
known kernels, one recovers the Painleve equations, found in prior work on the
subject.
