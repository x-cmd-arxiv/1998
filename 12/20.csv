applications, such as mapping the peculiar velocity field in the nearby
Universe. Of particular concern are systematic errors which vary slowly as a
function of position on the sky, as these would induce spurious bulk flow. We
have compared the reddenings of Burstein & Heiles (BH) and those of Schlegel,
Finkbeiner & Davis (SFD) to independent estimates of the reddening, for
Galactic latitudes |b| > 10. Our primary source of Galactic reddening estimates
comes from comparing the difference between the observed B-V colors of
early-type galaxies, and the predicted B-V color determined from the B-V--Mg_2
relation. We have fitted a dipole to the residuals in order to look for
large-scale systematic deviations. There is marginal evidence for a dipolar
residual in the comparison between the SFD maps and the observed early-type
galaxy reddenings. If this is due to an error in the SFD maps, then it can be
corrected with a small (13%) multiplicative dipole term. We argue, however,
that this difference is more likely to be due to a small (0.01 mag.) systematic
error in the measured B-V colors of the early-type galaxies. This
interpretation is supported by a smaller, independent data set (globular
cluster and RR Lyrae stars), which yields a result inconsistent with the
early-type galaxy residual dipole. BH reddenings are found to have no
significant systematic residuals, apart from the known problem in the region
230 < l < 310, -20 < b < 20.

galaxies (LBGs) at redshift z~3, previously discussed in Wechsler et al (1998).
We examine the likelihood of spikes found by Steidel et al (1998) in the
redshift distribution of LBGs, within a suite of models for the evolution of
structure in the Universe. Using high-resolution dissipationless N-body
simulations, we analyze deep pencil-beam surveys from these models in the same
way that they are actually observed, identifying LBGs with the most massive
dark matter halos. We find that all the models (with SCDM as a marginal
exception) have a substantial probability of producing spikes similar to those
observed, because the massive halos are much more clumped than the underlying
matter -- i.e., they are biased. Therefore, the likelihood of such a spike is
not a good discriminator among these models. The LBG correlation functions are
less steep than galaxies today (gamma~1.4), but show similar or slightly longer
correlation lengths. We have extened this analysis and include a preliminary
comparison to the new data presented in Adelberger et al (1998). We also
discuss work in progress, in which we use semi-analytic models to identify
Lyman-break galaxies within dark-matter halos.

Prochaska and Wolfe have argued that the flat distribution of velocity widths
combined with the asymmetric line profiles indicate that the DLAS are disks
with large rotation velocities. An alternative explanation has been proposed by
Haehnelt, Steinmetz, and Rauch, in which the observed large velocity widths and
asymmetric profiles can be produced by lines of sight passing through two or
more clumps each having relatively small internal velocity dispersions. We
investigate the plausibility of this scenario in the context of semi-analytic
models based on hierarchical merging trees and including simple treatments of
gas dynamics, star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical evolution. We
find that all the observed properties of the metal-line systems including the
distribution of velocities and the asymmetric profiles, can be reproduced by
lines of sight passing through sub-clumps that are bound within larger
virialized dark matter halos. In order to produce enough multiple hits, we find
that the cold gas must be considerably more extended than the optical radius of
the proto-galaxies, perhaps even beyond the tidal radius of the sub-halo. This
could occur due to tidal stripping or supernova-driven outflows.

B455 (1999) 55-61","10.1016/S0370-2693(99)00380-9",,"nucl-th",,"  We study the gamma p ---> K^+ Lambda(1405) reaction at energies close to
threshold using a chiral unitary model where the resonance is generated
dynamically from K^-p interaction with other channels constructed from the
octets of baryons and mesons. Predictions are made for cross sections into
several channels and it is shown that the detection of the K^+ is sufficient to
determine the shape and strength of the Lambda(1405) resonance. The
determination of the resonance properties in nuclei requires instead the
detection of the resonance decay channels. Pauli blocking effects on the
resonance, which have been shown to be very important for the resonance at rest
in the nucleus, are irrelevant here where the resonance is produced with a
large momentum. The nuclear modifications here would thus offer information on
the resonance and K^- nucleus dynamics complementary to the one offered so far
by K^- atoms.
