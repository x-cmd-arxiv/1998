associated with supernova (SN) 1998bw, has no X-ray afterglow, and has a single
peak light curve and a soft spectrum. The supernova is itself unusual in that
its expansion velocity exceeds c/6. We suggest that many of these features can
be accounted for with the hypothesis that we observe the GRB along a penumbral
line of sight that contains mainly photons that have scattered off ejected
baryons. The hypothesis suggests a baryon poor jet (BPJ) existing within a
baryon rich outflow. The sharp distinction can be attributed to whether or not
the magnetic field lines thread an event horizon. Such a configuration suggests
that there will be some non-thermal acceleration of pick-up ex-neutrons within
the BPJ. This scenario might produce observable spallation products and
neutrinos.

by Sadler and Gilmer. We again find a fixed-point attractor which describes the
dynamical convergence of the crystal thickness to a value just larger than the
minimum stable thickness, l_min. This convergence arises from the combined
effect of two constraints on the length of stems in a layer: it is unfavourable
for a stem to be shorter than l_min and for a stem to overhang the edge of the
previous layer. The relationship between this new mechanism and the explanation
given by Sadler and Gilmer in terms of an entropic barrier is discussed. We
also examine the behaviour of the Sadler-Gilmer model when an energetic
contribution from chain folds is included.

the front velocity as a function of the applied acceleration. This phenomenon
is explained by a model based on a single vibrated particle with multiple
attractors that is perturbed by collisions. A simulation shows that a
sufficiently high rate of interparticle collisions can prevent trapping in the
attractor corresponding to the nonmoving ground state.
