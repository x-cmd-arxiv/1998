spatial distribution of the dust temperature associated with the diffuse cirrus
and the dense molecular clouds. For a $\nu^2$ emissivity law, we find that the
equilibrium dust temperature of the cirrus is about 17.5 K with only small
variations over the high latitude sky. Comparison of the far Infrared DIRBE
maps shows the presence of a colder emission component with a temperature
around 15 K, assuming a $\nu^2$ emissivity law. The lowest values of the
temperature found in the cold regions ($\sim 13 K$) are compatible with the
results recently obtained for dense cores in star forming regions by the
balloon-borne experiment SPM-PRONAOS (Ristorcelli et al., 1996, 1998, Serra et
al., 1997). This cold component is in particular present in the direction of
known molecular complexes with low star forming activity such as Taurus. The
association between the cold component and molecular clouds is further
demonstrated by the fact that all sky pixels with significant cold emission
have an excess IR emission with respect to the high latitude IR/HI correlation.
We have deduced a threshold value of the column density, $N_{HI} = 2.5 10^{20}
H/cm^2$, below which cold dust is not detected within the FIRAS beam of $\sim
7\degr$. We have re-examined the problem of the existence of a very cold dust
component ($T \sim 7 K$) by combining DIRBE maps of the cold emission with
FIRAS spectra, corrected for the isotropic component found in Puget et al.
(1996). The warm and cold component deduced from the analysis of DIRBE maps
account for the Galactic FIRAS spectra with no need for a very cold component

gravitational perturbations, i.e. in a non-dissipative way. If plotted in the

between resonant groups), quite similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the main
asteroid belt. An appreciable fraction of the test bodies reveals, for some
time, an accumulation near (rather than in) the resonances, both interior and
exterior, with the giant planets. An accompanying paper considers the
population simulated in this work as the major source of dust in the outer

taken into account: 1) gravitational scattering on four giant planets; 2)
planetary resonances; and 3) the Poynting-Robertson (P-R) and solar wind drags.
A file consisting of $0.9\times 10^6$ particle positions has been computed to
simulate the dust distribution in the outer parts of the Solar system. We find
that this distribution is highly non-uniform, with most of the dust
concentrating into four belts associated with the orbits of four giant planets,
with a sharp rise (depending on the size of particles) at the innermost part of
the ring. As in I, we reveal a rich and sophisticated resonant structure of
these belts containing families of resonances and gaps. A dissipative nature of
the P-R drag results in specific features of particle's capture into, and
evolution in, the resonances. Based on our simulations, we expect a new,
quasi-stationary dust population to exist in the belts near Jupiter and Saturn,
which is highly inclined and possesses large eccentricities. This population is
basically non-resonant and is an important addition to otherwise resonant dust
belts. The simulated dust is likely the main source of the zodiacal light in

study its consequences, which are not restricted to near equilibrium

role of polarons (composite particles formed by a charge strongly coupled with
a local lattice deformation) in doped perovskites, hosting colossal
magnetoresistance (CMR) and high Tc superconductivity. While the role of
polarons is generally recognized in manganites due to the large amplitude of
the local lattice deformation, the scientific debate remains open on the
cuprates where the lattice deformation is smaller and the anomalous normal
metallic phase becomes complex due to the coexistence of polarons with
itinerant carriers. Moreover the segregation of polarons and itinerant charges
in different spatial domains forming lattice-charge stripes as well as the slow
dynamic 1D spin fluctuations have been observed. The debate on the driving
force for the stripe formation remains object of discussion since it could be
purely due to electronic interactions and/or due to strong electron-lattice
(polaronic) interactions. In order to explore the important role of the latter
in stripe charge segregation, we have studied isotope effects on the dynamical

The magnetoresistance depends quadratically on the magnetic field in low fields

rearrangement of the electron wave function in magnetic field. Using the fact
that the incoherent part of the scattering probability for electron scattering
on impurities and bulk defects is proportional to the integral of the forth
power of the envelope wave function, the calculated field dependence of the

find that near J2/J1 = 0.5, i.e., in the region where the classical spin
configuration changes from a Neel ordered phase to a spiral phase, the
staggered magnetization vanishes, suggesting the possibility of a quantum
disordered state. In this region, the quantum correction to the magnetization
is large but finite. This is in contrast to the frustrated Heisenberg model on
a square lattice, for which the quantum correction diverges logarithmically at
the transition from the Neel to the collinear phase. For large J2/J1, the model

properties of an anisotropic XY spin chain in a transverse field. The continuum
limit of the corresponding fermion model is taken and in various cases results
in a Dirac equation with a random mass. Exact analytic techniques can then be
used to evaluate the density of states and the localization length. In the
presence of disorder the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic or Ising transition of the
model is in the same universality class as the random transverse field Ising
model solved by Fisher using a real space renormalization group decimation
technique (RSRGDT). If there is only randomness in the anisotropy of the
magnetic exchange then the anisotropy transition (from a ferromagnet in the $x$
direction to a ferromagnet in the $y$ direction) is also in this universality
class. However, if there is randomness in the isotropic part of the exchange or
in the transverse field then in a non-zero transverse field the anisotropy
transition is destroyed by the disorder. We show that in the Griffiths' phase
near the Ising transition that the ground state energy has an essential
singularity. The results obtained for the dynamical critical exponent, the
typical correlation length, and the temperature dependence of the specific heat
near the Ising transition agree with the results of the RSRGDT and numerical

crossing symmetry of the S-Matrix and of formfactors (cyclicity relation) in
such theories is intimately related to the KMS properties of new quantum-local
PFG (one-particle polarization-free generators) of these wedge algebras. These
generators are ``on-shell'' and their Fourier transforms turn out to fulfill
the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra. As the wedge algebras contain the crossing
symmetry informations, the double cone algebras reveal the particle content of
fields. Modular theory associates with this double cone algebra two very useful
chiral conformal quantum field theories which are the algebraic versions of the
light ray algebras.

  Fourier Analysis and Spectral Sensitivity of Timing Observations to

standards which admits to introduce modified versions of universal and
ephemeris time scales based correspondingly on the intrinsic rotation of pulsar
and on its orbital motion around barycenter of a binary system. Measured
stability of these time scales depends on numerous physical phenomena which
affect rotational and orbital motion of the pulsar and observer on the Earth,
perturb propagation of electromagnetic pulses from pulsar to the observer and
bring about random fluctuations in the rate of atomic clock used as a primary
time reference in timing observations. On the long time intervals the main
reason for the instability of the pulsar time scales is the presence of
correlated, low-frequency timing noise in residuals of times of arrivals (TOA)
of pulses from the pulsar which has both astrophysical and geophysical origin.
Hence, the timing noise can carry out the important physical information about
interstellar medium, interior structure of the pulsar, stochastic gravitational
waves coming from the early universe, etc. Each specific type of the
low-frequency noise can be described in framework of power law spectrum model.
Although the data processing of pulsar timing observations in time domain seems
to be the most imformative it is significantly important to know to which
spectral bands single and binary pulsars, considered as detectors of the
low-frequency noise signal, are the most sensitive. The given problem is
examined in the present article.

isopoincar\'e symmetry and the isospecial relativity provide a formulation of
arbitrary speeds of light within physical media as invariant as that of the
special relativity for the propagation of light in vacuum; we prove that the
isospecial relativity is directly universal, in the sense of holding for all
possible spacetime models with a symmetric metric directly in the frame of the
observer; we outline the broader genotopic and hyperstructural formulations

quadrature for which optimal squeezing occurs depends on the squeezing phase
$\Phi ,$ the Rabi frequency $\Omega ,$ and the atomic detuning $\Delta $. Pure
states are described for arbitrary $\Phi ,$ not just $\Phi =0$ or $\pi $ as in

entangled states, such as the Bell-states and the GHZ-states, which is
essential in certain processes of quantum communication, computation, and
teleportation. No interaction between the individual parts of the entangled
system, nor with any environment is required. A small probe (e.g. a single
qubit) takes care of all interaction with the system, and is used repeatedly.
The probe-qubit interaction is of the simplest form, and only this one type of
interaction is required to perform a complete measurement. The process may be
divided into elementary local operations and interactions, taking place
sequentially as the probe visits each of the qubits. A shuttle mode is
described, which may be repeated indefinitely. By the quantum Zeno effect, the
entangled states can be maintained until released in a predictable state. This
shuttle process is stable, and self-correcting, by virtue of the standard
measurements performed repeatedly on the probe.
