phenomena that are difficult to explain using rational expectations models.
This paper studies these using a nonequilibrium price formation rule, developed
in the context of trading with market orders. Because this is so much simpler
than a standard inter-temporal equilibrium model, it is possible to study
multi-period markets analytically. There price dynamics have second order
oscillatory terms.
  Value investing does not necessarily cause prices to track values. Trend
following causes short term trends in prices, but also causes longer-term
oscillations. When value investing and trend following are combined, even
though there is little linear structure, there can be boom-bust cycles,excess
and temporally correlated volatility, and fat tails in price fluctuations. The
long term evolution of markets can be studied in terms of flows of money.
  Profits can be decomposed in terms of aggregate pairwise correlations.
  Under reinvestment of profits this leads to a capital allocation model that
is equivalent to a standard model in population biology. An investigation of
market efficiency shows that patterns created by trend followers are more
resistant to efficiency than those created by value investors, and that profit
maximizing behavior slows the progression to efficiency. Order of magnitude
estimates suggest that the timescale for efficiency is years to decades.

  Post Hipparcos Era"", eds Egret and Heck. 18 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Thanks to HST, there are now many galaxies with Cepheid distances and these
provide the main platform for the calibration of the secondary distance
indicators. I review recent progress in our understanding of the standard
candle properties of Cepheids with particular emphasis on the techniques used
in the HST studies. The PL relation defined by Cepheids in the LMC is shown to
be excellent, although the distance to the LMC, which determines the
zero-point, is still rather controversial. This LMC relation is consistent with
the galactic calibrations which use Hipparcos parallaxes or Baade-Wesselink
distances. However, the PL plot for Cepheids observed in galactic open-clusters
is suggestive of an age dependence of the main-sequence fitting distances,
similar to that seen for clusters with Hipparcos parallax distances.
Observational and theoretical studies suggest that the metallicity dependence
of Cepheid properties is not large, but is sufficiently important that it
should be accounted for. However, the fact that target galaxies are typically
of similar metallicities to the calibrators, suggest that metallicity
corrections won't have a major impact on estimates of the Hubble constant.
Incompleteness biases can also affect Cepheid samples, but are usually best
dealt with by imposing a conservative lower limit on period.

stellar populations in super star clusters which also provide useful contraints
on evolutionary models for massive stars e.g. at very low metallicities

ICM-ISM stripping in action. Optical broadband and H-alpha images from the WIYN
telescope of the highly inclined galaxy reveal a relatively undisturbed stellar
disk and a peculiar distribution of H-alpha emission. Ten percent of the
H-alpha emission arises from extraplanar HII regions which appear to lie within
filamentary structures >3 kpc long above one side of the disk. The filaments
emerge from the outer edge of a disk of bright H-alpha emission which is
abruptly truncated beyond 0.35R(25). Together the truncated H-alpha disk and
extraplanar H-alpha filaments are reminiscent of a bow shock morphology, which
strongly suggests that the interstellar medium (ISM) of NGC 4522 is being
stripped by the gas pressure of the intracluster medium (ICM). The galaxy has a
line-of-sight velocity of 1300 km/sec with respect to the mean Virgo cluster
velocity, and thus is expected to experience a strong interaction with the
intracluster gas. The existence of HII regions apparently located above the
disk plane suggests that star formation is occuring in the stripped gas, and
that newly formed stars will enter the galaxy halo and/or intracluster space.
The absence of HII regions in the disk beyond 0.35R(25), and the existence of
HII regions in the stripped gas suggest that even molecular gas has been
effectively removed from the disk of the galaxy.

statistical rotational symmetry in the infinite volume limit. A finite patch,
however, cannot be perfectly isotropic, and we compute the rates at which the
anisotropy scales with size. In a sample of volume N, tiles appear in
O(N^{1/6}) distinct orientations. However, the orientations are not uniformly
populated. A small (O(N^{1/84})) set of these orientations account for the
majority of the tiles. Furthermore, these orientations are not uniformly
distributed on SO(3). Sample averages of functions on SO(3) seem to approach
their ergodic limits as N^{-1/336}. Since even macroscopic patches of a
quaquaversal tiling maintain noticable anisotropy, a hypothetical physical
quasicrystal whose structure was similar to the quaquaversal tiling could be
identified by anisotropic features of its electron diffraction pattern.

  THE OLD ABSTRACT: We give a construction of Connes-Moscovici's cyclic
cohomology for any Hopf algebra equipped with a twisted antipode. Furthermore,
we introduce a non-commutative Weil complex, which connects the work of Gelfand

naturally when looking at Hopf algebra actions and invariant higher traces, to
give a non-commutative version of the usual Chern-Weil theory.

spontaneous magnetization of the Heisenberg XXZ chain (Delta >1) on the finite
lattice as the ratio of two determinants. In the thermodynamic limit (the
lattice of infinite length), the Baxter formula is reproduced in the framework
of Algebraic Bethe Ansatz. It is shown that the finite size corrections to the
Baxter formula are exponentially small.
