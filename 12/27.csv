  Francisco: ASP), p. 16",,,"astro-ph",,"  Selected topics dealing with X-ray/soft gamma-ray emission from accreting
black-hole sources are reviewed. The shape of soft gamma-ray spectra of
Seyferts observed by OSSE can be well modelled by thermal Comptonization. A
very strong correlation between the X-ray slope and the strength of Compton
reflection in these sources can then be explained by thermal Comptonization in
vicinity of the reflecting cold media. Similar correlation is seen for the hard
state of black-hole binaries, but the strength of Compton reflection at a given
X-ray slope is larger than in Seyferts. This appears to be due to seed photons
(for Comptonization) emitted by the cold media having larger energies in
stellar-mass systems than in Seyferts. Broad-line radio galaxies have hard
X-ray spectra with weak reflection, which reflection is similar to that in
Seyferts with hard X-ray spectra. Two main models for the source geometry, a
hot inner disk surrounded by a cold outer disk, and a dynamic corona above a
cold disk, appear about equally viable based on the presently available data.

non-ohmic current-voltage characteristics for the tunneling into fractional
quantum Hall liquids. We give a possible explanation for the experiment in
terms of the chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. We study the interaction
between the charge and neutral modes, and found that the leading order
correction to the exponent $\alpha$ $(I\sim V^\alpha)$ is of the order of
$\sqrt{\epsilon}$ $(\epsilon=v_n/v_c)$, which reduces the exponent $\alpha$. We
suggest that it could explain the systematic discrepancy between the observed
exponents and the exact $\alpha =1/\nu$ dependence.

  Cotton-Mouton effect","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  We demonstrate that the boundary of two optical isomers with opposite
directions of the gyration vectors (both parallel to boundary) can support
propagation of electromagnetic wave in the direction perpendicular to the
gyration axes (Cotton-Mouton geometry). The components of electromagnetic field
in this wave decay exponentially into both media. The characteristic decay
length is of the order of the Faraday rotation length for the propagation along
the gyration axis. The remarkable property of the boundary wave is its
chirality. Namely, the wave can propagate only in one direction determined by
the relative sign of non-diagonal components of the dielectric tensor in
contacting media. We find the dispersion law of the boundary wave for the cases
of abrupt and smooth boundaries. We also study the effect of asymmetry between
the contacting media on the boundary wave and generalize the result to the case
of two parallel boundaries. Finally we consider the arrangement when the
boundaries form a random network. We argue that at a point, when this network
percolates, the corresponding boundary waves undergo quantum delocalization
transition, similar to the quantum Hall transition.

spin and orbital orderings are examined as functions of carrier concentration
in the mean-field approximation applied to the effective Hamiltonian. We obtain
the first order phase transition between ferromagnetic metallic and
ferromagnetic insulating states in the lightly doped region. The transition is
accompanied with the orbital order-disorder one which is directly observed in
the anomalous X-ray scattering experiments. The present investigation shows a
novel role of the orbital degree of freedom on metal-insulator transition in
manganites.
