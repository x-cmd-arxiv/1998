absorption line systems seen in the HST spectrum of the QSO. We detect a new
quasar with z=1.3360 at only 45"" angular separation from this QSO. This quasar
pair is thus an ideal target for QSO environment studies: indeed, strong HI
absorptions are seen at z(abs) = 1.3367 in the QSO spectrum, consistent with
neutral hydrogen column densities log N(HI) > 16. A bright galaxy at 4""7 from
the QSO is at z = 0.570, corresponding also to HI absorption in the QSO's
spectrum. Other galaxies are also discussed.

  at http://panisse.lbl.gov/public/bruce/irsn",,"10.1086/300962",,"astro-ph",,"  IR and Radio band observations of heavily extinguished regions in starburst
galaxies suggest a very high SN rate associated with such regions. Optically
measured supernova (SN) rates may therefore underestimate the total SN rate by
factors of up to 10, due to the high extinction to SNe in starburst regions.
The IR/radio SN rates come from a variety of indirect means, however, which
suffer from model dependence and other problems.
  We describe a direct measurement of the SN rate from a regular patrol of
starburst galaxies done with K' band imaging to minimize the effects of
extinction. A collection of K' measurements of core-collapse SNe near maximum
light is presented. Results of a preliminary SN search using the MIRC camera at
the Wyoming IR Observatory (WIRO), and an improved search using the ORCA optics
are described. A monthly patrol of starburst galaxies within 25 Mpc should
yield 1.6 - 9.6 SNe/year. Our MIRC search with low-resolution (2.2"" pixels)
failed to find extinguished SNe, limiting the SN rate outside the nucleus (at >
15"" radius) to less than 3.8 Supernova Rate Units (SRU or SNe/century/10^10
L(solar); 90% confidence). The MIRC camera had insufficient resolution to
search nuclear starburst regions, where SN activity is concentrated, explaining
why we found no heavily obscured SNe. We conclude that high-resolution, small
field SN searches in starburst nuclei are more productive than low resolution,
large-field searches, even for our large galaxies. With our ORCA
high-resolution optics, we could limit the total SN rate to < 1.3 SRU at 90%
confidence in 3 years of observations, lower than the most pessimistic
estimate.

absorption lines are blueshifted (or in a few cases at rest) with respect to
the narrow emission lines, indicating that the absorbing gas is undergoing net
radial outflow. At high resolution, the absorption often splits into distinct
kinematic components that show a wide range in widths (20 - 400 km/s FWHM),
indicating macroscopic motions (e.g., radial velocity subcomponents or
turbulence) within a component. The strong absorption components have cores

extensive Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (NEMD) simulations, we show that
when the contact angle is large enough, the boundary condition can drastically
differ (at a microscopic level) from a ""no-slip"" condition. Slipping lengths
exceeding 30 molecular diameters are obtained for a contact angle of 140
degrees, characteristic of Mercury on glass. On the basis of a Kubo expression
for $\delta$, we derive an expression for the slipping length in terms of
equilibrium quantities of the system. The predicted behaviour is in very good
agreement with the numerical results for the slipping length obtained in the

transitions between expanding and contracting solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation. We first show that upon neglecting only backscattering, one obtains
an intermediate regime in which matter evolves unitarily but which does not
correspond to any Schr\""odinger equation in a given geometry since
gravitational backreaction effects are taken into account at the quantum level.
We then show that backscattering amplitudes are exponentially smaller than
matter transition amplitudes. Both results follow from an adiabatic treatment
valid for macroscopic universes. To understand how backscattering and the
intermediate regime should be interpreted, we review the problem of electronic
transitions induced by nuclear motion since it is mathematically very similar.
In this problem, transition amplitudes are obtained from the conserved current.
The same applies to quantum cosmology and shows that the unique consistent
interpretation is based on the current when backscattering is neglected. We
then review why, in a relativistic context, backscattering is interpreted as
pair production whereas it is not in the non relativistic case. In each example
the correct interpretation is obtained by coupling the system to an external
quantum device. From the absence of such external systems in cosmology, we
conclude that backscattering does not have a unique consistent interpretation
in quantum cosmology.

rare heavy-to-light transitions in the region where the energy release E is
large compared to the strong interaction scale and to the mass of the final
hadron, i.e. for q^2 not close to the zero-recoil point. We derive the
Effective Lagrangian from the QCD one, and show that in the limit of heavy mass
M for the initial hadron and large energy E for the final one, the heavy and
light quark fields behave as two-component spinors. Neglecting QCD
short-distance corrections, this implies that there are only three form factors
describing all the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar or vector weak current matrix
elements. We argue that the dependence of these form factors with respect to M
and E should be factorizable, the M-dependence (sqrt(M)) being derived from the
usual heavy quark expansion while the E-dependence is controlled by the
behaviour of the light-cone distribution amplitude near the end-point u=1. The
usual expectation of the (1-u) behaviour leads to a 1/E^2 scaling law, that is
a dipole form in q^2. We also show explicitly that in the appropriate limit,
the Light-Cone Sum Rule method satisfies our general relations as well as the
scaling laws in M and E of the form factors, and obtain very compact and simple
expressions for the latter. Finally we note that this formalism gives
theoretical support to the quark model-inspired methods existing in the

subfactors, in particular in view of the system of sectors obtained by mixing
the two kinds of induction arising from the two choices of braiding. We
construct a relative braiding between the irreducible subsectors of the two
``chiral'' induced systems, providing a proper braiding on their intersection.
We also express the principal and dual principal graphs of the local subfactors
in terms of the induced sector systems. This extended theory is again applied
to conformal or orbifold embeddings of SU(n) WZW models. A simple formula for
the corresponding modular invariant matrix is established in terms of the two
inductions, and we show that it holds if and only if the sets of irreducible
subsectors of the two chiral induced systems intersect minimally on the set of
marked vertices i.e. on the ``physical spectrum'' of the embedding theory, or
if and only if the canonical endomorphism sector of the conformal or orbifold
inclusion subfactor is in the full induced system. We can prove either
condition for all simple current extensions of SU(n) and many conformal
inclusions, covering in particular all type I modular invariants of SU(2) and
SU(3), and we conjecture that it holds also for any other conformal inclusion
of SU(n) as well. As a by-product of our calculations, the dual principal graph
for the conformal inclusion $SU(3)_5 \subset SU(6)_1$ is computed for the first
time.

symmetry group of the Kepler problem. Moreover, we also show that classical
perturbation theory yields the {\it exact} evolution in time of these quantum
states, and so we explain the surprising match between purely classical
perturbative calculations and experiments. Finally, as a first application, we
propose a fast method for the excitation of circular states; these are
ultrastable hydrogenic eigenstates which have maximum total angular momentum
