implied an unusually high temperature of ~17 keV. Such a high temperature would
make it the hottest known cluster and severely constrain cosmological since, in
a Universe with critical density Omega=1 the probability of observing such a
cluster is only 4e-5. Here we test the robustness of this observational result
since it has such important implications. We analysed the data using a variety
of different data analysis methods and spectral analysis assumptions and find a
temperature of ~11-12 keV in all cases, except for one class of spectral fits.
These are fits in which the absorbing column density is fixed at the Galactic
value. We show that a high temperature of ~17 keV is artificially obtained if
the true spectrum has a stronger low- energy cut-off than that for Galactic
absorption only. The extra absorption may be astrophysical in origin, or it may
be a problem with the low-energy CCD efficiency. Although significantly lower
than previous measurements, this temperature of kT ~11-12 keV is still
relatively high since only a few clusters have been found to have temperatures
higher than 10 keV and the data therefore still present some difficulty for an
Omega=1 Universe. Our results will also be useful to anyone who wants to
estimate the systematic errors involved in different methods of background
subtraction of ASCA data for sources with similar S/N to that of the 1E0657-56

the emission from heavily obscured AGN. Recent studies have revealed the
presence of a new population of hard X-ray sources which must contribute
significantly to the XRB. However, whether the majority of these sources are
obscured AGN or some other type of object at present remains unclear. Here, we
further examine the possibility that a significant fraction of the XRB comes
from a population of galaxies undergoing advection-dominated accretion in the
high-\mdot regime and thus produce intrinsically hard spectra. When the
accretion rate is close to its critical value, above which an
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) no longer exists, the major
contribution to X-ray emission is due to inverse Compton scattering of the soft
seed photons produced by cyclo-synchrotron radiation. In this regime, the
resulting ADAF spectra are relatively hard with a fairly constant X-ray
spectral index \alpha \sim 0.2-0.4 and a spectral cut-off at \sim 200 keV. We
show that the integrated emission from such sources can provide a good fit to
the hard (> 2 keV) X-ray background, provided that the spectrum is dominated by
the contribution from objects located at redshifts z \sim 2-3. The model
requires most of the contribution to the XRB to be due to objects accreting at
the critical rate.

Such highly SMSs will have a surface density as low as $10^{-14}$ g/cm$^3$ and
they will not behave like a compact object with a ``hard surface'. For all such

in the universe after decoupling. Comparing the time-scale of dynamical
evolution with that of fragmentation, we can estimate the typical fragmentation
scale. We propose the following scenario of the formation process of first
luminous objects consisting of large number stars. First, by pancake collapse
of the overdensity regions in the expanding universe or collision between
clouds in potential wells, quasi-plane shocks form. If the shock-heated
temperature is higher than about $10^4$ K, the postshock gas cools down to
several hundred K by \Hbun line cooling, and the shock-compressed layer
fragments into filamentary clouds. The filamentary cloud collapses dynamically
once more and fragments into cloud cores. Finally, a primordial star forms in a
cloud core. We show that the minimum mass of the first star is essentially
determined by the Chandrasekhar mass. Also, we investigate the dynamical
collapse of cloud cores by numerical simulation and show that the evolution
paths of the central regions of the cores depend only very weakly on the total
core mass. After mass accretion, a massive star may be formed in a core, since
the estimated mass accretion rate is very large. In such a case, it may be
possible for many massive stars form almost simultaneously. Then the clouds can
be luminous objects. On the other hand, if the shock-heated temperature is
lower, effective star formation is delayed significantly.

good agreement between the power spectrum measured for the Durham/UKST Survey

rates, magnitude limits and survey geometries employed, on scales up to lambda

the power measured from the Stromlo-APM Survey (Tadros & Efstathiou), but find
more power than estimated from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (Lin et al). We
apply a simple model for redshift space distortions to the real space APM
Galaxy Survey power spectrum and find a shape and amplitude that is in very
good agreement with the power spectrum of the Durham/UKST Survey. This implies
beta=Omega^{0.6}/b=0.60 +/- 0.35, where Omega is the density parameter and b is
the bias between fluctuations in the galaxy and mass distributions, and also
suggests a one dimensional velocity dispersion of sigma = 320 +/-140 km/s. We
find that for any choice of normalisation, the standard CDM model has a shape
that cannot be reconciled with the Durham/UKST Survey power spectrum, unless
either unacceptably high values of the one dimensional velocity dispersion are
adopted or the assumption that bias is constant is invalid on scales greater
than 20/h Mpc. Over the range of wavenumbers for which we have a robust
measurement of the power spectrum, we find the best agreement is obtained for a
critical density CDM model in which the shape of the power spectrum is
modified. (Abridged)

derive the spatial variation of different properties (intensity, velocity and
width / line splitting) of the emission lines H\alpha and [O III] \lambda 5007
along the nuclear region. We have found that the Giant H II region around the
two most massive clusters in NGC 4214 (A and B) is resolved into two clearly
separated regions. We have not detected superbubbles with the properties we
would expect according to the evolutionary state of the stellar clusters, but
just a partial ring feature around the most massive one and two expanding
shells around cluster B. The first expanding shell seems to have experienced
blowout, whereas the second one is still complete. A possible explanation to
this phenomenon is that the most massive stars in a starburst spend a large
fraction of their lives buried inside their original molecular clouds.
Champagne flows might have formed at the borders of the regions, especially on
the SE complex, explaining the existence of the diffuse ionized gas around the
galaxy. As a consequence of these results we postulate that NGC 4214 is indeed
a dwarf spiral galaxy, with a thin (around 200 pc) disk that inhibits the
formation of large scale structures in the ISM. The mechanical input deposited
by the star formation complexes, in a variety of physical processes that
include the free expanding bubbles liberated after blowout and photoevaporation
of the parent clouds, have succeeded in generating the structures now detected
far from the disk, giving place to the large-scale structure which now enriches
the optical appearance of the galaxy.

result is likely to be modified with the availability of more data. On the
other hand, rare instances of three simultaneous subpulses in a single period
have been noticed. This is consistent with the Ruderman and Sutherland model of
the drifting phenomenon in which several sparks, uniformly spaced on a circle,
rotate around the polar cap. The third subpulse appears to show up strongly
when subpulses belonging to the primary drift bands weaken. Although this
conclusion is based mainly on two reliable examples, it suggests an anti
correlation of the subpulse energies. The normalised correlation coefficient
between the energies of the two subpulses in a period is -0.16 +- 0.02, after
accounting for a known selection effect. Simulations suggest that this result
could not be an artefact. This suggests the idea of competing drifting
subpulses which, if true, will have important ramifications for the growth and
breakdown of the particle acceleration zones in pulsars.

have absolute magnitudes far brighter than Mv~5.7, and it is suggested that
these objects (~20% of the total sample) are K0IV stars which may have been

redshift objects with larger, low redshift galaxies. These companion objects
show a continuous range of physical properties - from very compact, high
redshift quasars, through smaller active galaxies and finally to only slightly
smaller companion galaxies of slightly higher redshift. The shift in energy
distribution from high to low makes it clear that are seeing an empirical
evolution from newly created to older, more normal galaxies.
  In order to account for the evolution of intrinsic redshift we must conclude
that matter is initially born with low mass particles whose mass increase with
time (age). This requires a physics which is non-local (Machian) and which is
therefore more applicable to the cosmos than the Big Bang extrapolation of
local physics. Ambartsumian's ""superfluid"" foresaw some of the properties of
the new, low particle mass, protogalactic plasma which is required,
demonstrating again the age-old lesson that open minded observation is much
more powerful than theoretical assumptions.
  Since the ejected plasma, which preferentially emerges along the minor axis
of the parent galaxy, develops into an entire galaxy, accretion disks cannot
supply sufficient material. New matter must be created within a ""white hole""
rather than bouncing old matter off a ""black hole"".

between small-scale halo structure and the disk spins up and flattens the inner

rapidly rotating bulge. Two possible candidates for the required halo

rich dual structure.
  We derive general exact mappings of the QDV model on several dual discrete
representations, including pairs of self-dual models, for general linear
environments and arbitrary temperatures. Self-duality allows to write exact
equations for each correlation function of each representation.

presented. Finally we discuss the fundamental character of the QDV model.
  For instance, the standard Caldeira-Leggett model, which describes mesoscopic
Josephson junctions in a circuit and many other physical systems, is a special

is calculated for two distinct models for the interlayer transport. The first
model involves coherent interlayer transport and makes use of results of
semi-classical or Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory. The second model involves
weakly incoherent interlayer transport where the electron is scattered many
times within a layer before tunneling into the next layer. The results are
relevant to the interpretation of experiments on angular-dependent
magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) in quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional
metals. We find that the dependence of the magnetoresistance on the direction
of the magnetic field is identical for both models except when the field is
almost parallel to the layers. An important implication of this result is that
a three-dimensional Fermi surface is not necessary for the observation of the
Yamaji and Danner oscillations seen in quasi-two- and quasi-one-dimensional
metals, respectively. A universal expression is given for the dependence of the
resistance at AMRO maxima and minima on the magnetic field and scattering time
(and thus the temperature). We point out three distinctive features of coherent
interlayer transport: (i) a beat frequency in the magnetic oscillations of
quasi-two-dimensional systems, (ii) a peak in the angular-dependent
magnetoresistance when the field is sufficiently large and parallel to the
layers, and (iii) a crossover from a linear to a quadratic field dependence for
the magnetoresistance when the field is parallel to the layers. Properties (i)
and (ii) are compared with published experimental data for a range of
quasi-two-dimensional organic metals and for Sr2RuO4.

proportional extension are considered along directions [001] and [111]. The

calculated, and the results agree well with the experimental data. As the four
Si-C bonds along directions [111], [$\bar{1}$11], [11$\bar{1}$] and
[1$\bar{1}$1] are not the same under the loading along [111], internal
relaxation and the corresponding internal displacements must be considered. We
find that, at the beginning of loading, the effect of internal displacement
through shuffle and glide plane diminishes the difference among the four Si-C
bonds length, but will increase the difference at the subsequent loading, which
will result in a crack nucleated on \{111\} shuffle plane and a subsequently
cleavage fracture. Thus the corresponding theoretical strength is 50.8 GPa,
which agrees well with the recent experiment value, 53.4 GPa. However, with the
loading along [001], internal relaxation is not important for tetragonal
symmetry. Elastic constants during the uniaxial tension along [001] are
calculated. Based on the stability analysis with stiffness coefficients, we
find that the spinodal and Born instabilities are triggered almost at the same

excitation spectrum derived using the linear spin-wave theory is gapless. The
quantum (fluctuation) corrections to the order parameter and to the ground

in Found. Phys. Lett. [2]. Apparent disagreement with experiment as well as
internal inconsistencies found in the traditional analysis of relativistically
rotating frames/disks are summarized. As one example, a point p at 0 degrees on
the circumference of a rotating disk does not, according to the standard
theory, exist at the same moment in time as the same point p at 360 degrees.
This and other problems with the standard theory are completely resolved by a
novel analysis that directly addresses, apparently for the first time, the
non-time-orthogonal nature of rotating frames. Though ultimately consonant with
the special and general theories of relativity, due to non-time-orthogonality,
the analysis predicts several peculiar (i.e., not traditionally relativistic)
results. For example, the local circumferential speed of light is not invariant
(thereby agreeing with the Sagnac experiment), and no Lorentz contraction
exists along the disk rim. Other experimental results, including time dilation,
mass-energy dependence on speed, and what has heretofore been considered a
""spurious"" signal in the most accurate Michelson-Morley experiment performed to
date, are accurately predicted. Further, the widely accepted postulate for the
equivalence of co-moving inertial and non-inertial rods, used liberally with
prior rotating frame analyses, is shown to be invalid for non-time-orthogonal
frames. This understanding of the ramifications of non-time-orthogonality
resolves paradoxes inherent in the traditional theory.

in an uniform electric field. Both problems are approached using the method of
complex path analysis. Particle production in Schwarzchild-like spacetimes with
a horizon is obtained here by a new and simple semi-classical method based on
the method of complex paths. Hawking radiation is obtained in the (t,r)
co-ordinate system of the standard Schwarzchild metric {\it without} requiring
the Kruskal extension. The co-ordinate singularity present at the horizon
manifests itself as a singularity in the expression for the semi-classical
propagator for a scalar field. We give a prescription whereby this singularity
is regularised with Hawking's result being recovered. In the case of the
electric field, standard quantum field theoretic methods can be used to obtain
particle production in a purely time-dependent gauge. In a purely
space-dependent gauge, however, the tunnelling interpretation has to be
resorted to. We attempt, in this paper, to provide a tunnelling description for
both the time and space dependent gauges. The usefulness of such a common
description becomes evident when `mixed' gauges, which are functions of both
space and time variables, are analysed. We report, in this paper, certain mixed
gauges which have the interesting property that mode functions in these gauges
are found to be a combination of {\it elementary} functions unlike the standard
modes. Finally, we present an attempt to interpret particle production by the
electric field as a tunnelling process between the two sectors of the Rindler
spacetime.

The effective theory is shown to be a gauged version of five-dimensional N=1
supergravity coupled, for simplicity, to the universal hypermultiplet and
four-dimensional boundary theories with gauge and universal gauge matter
fields. The static vacuum of the theory is a pair of BPS three-brane domain
walls. We show that this five-dimensional theory, together with the domain wall
vacuum solution, provides the correct starting point for early universe
cosmology in Horava-Witten theory. Relevant cosmological solutions are those
associated with the BPS domain wall vacuum. Such solutions must be
inhomogeneous, depending on the orbifold coordinate as well as on time. We
present two examples of this new type of cosmological solution, obtained by
separation of variables. The first example represents the analog of a rolling
radii solution with the radii specifying the geometry of the domain wall pair.
This is generalized in the second example to include a nontrivial Ramond-Ramond
scalar.

Klein-Gordon model in (1+1) dimensions is constructed which preserves the
topological lower bound on kink energy. It is proved that, provided the lattice
spacing h is sufficiently small, there exist static kink solutions attaining
this lower bound centred anywhere relative to the spatial lattice. Hence there
is no Peierls-Nabarro barrier impeding the propagation of kinks in this
discrete system. An upper bound on h is derived and given a physical
interpretation in terms of the radiation of the system. The construction, which
works most naturally when the nonlinear Klein-Gordon model has a squared
polynomial interaction potential, is applied to a recently proposed continuum
model of polymer twistons. Numerical simulations are presented which
demonstrate that kink pinning is eliminated, and radiative kink deceleration
greatly reduced in comparison with the conventional discrete system. So even on
a very coarse lattice, kinks behave much as they do in the continuum. It is
argued, therefore, that the construction provides a natural means of
numerically simulating kink dynamics in nonlinear Klein-Gordon models of this
type. The construction is compared with the inverse method of Flach, Zolotaryuk
and Kladko. Using the latter method, alternative spatial discretizations of the
twiston and sine-Gordon models are obtained which are also free of the

latter being isomorphic to the compact group associated to S by the duality
theorem of Doplicher and Roberts. Denoting by D\subset C the full subcategory

S\subset D. Under this condition C\rtimes S has no degenerate objects iff S=D.
If the original category C is rational (i.e. has only finitely many equivalence

clarified quite explicitly in terms of group cohomology.

whose quantum group structures have been constructed on a certain twisted group
C*-algebra. In a sense, it may be considered as a ``quantum Heisenberg group
C*-algebra''. In this paper, we will find, up to equivalence, all of its
irreducible *-representations. We will point out the Kirillov type
correspondence between the irreducible representations and the so-called
``dressing orbits''. By taking advantage of its comultiplication, we will then
introduce and study the notion of ``inner tensor product representations''. We
will show that the representation theory satisfies a ``quasitriangular'' type
property, which does not appear in ordinary group representation theory.

effect of mixing of the chiral partners correlators, reflecting the phenomena
of partial restoration of chiral symmetry. The different scenarios of such

one-dimensional lattices which support these solutions. We apply this mapping -
by definition an inverse method - to acoustic solitons in chains with nonlinear
intersite interactions, to nonlinear Klein-Gordon chains, to reaction-diffusion
equations and to discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger systems. Potential functions
can be found in at least a unique way provided the pulse shape is reflection
symmetric and pulse and kink shapes are at least $C^2$ functions. For kinks we
discuss the relation of our results to the problem of a Peierls-Nabarro
potential and continuous symmetries. We then generalize our method to higher
dimensional lattices for reaction-diffusion systems. We find that increasing
also the number of components easily allows for moving solutions.

  Solution of the causal paradoxes","plain LaTeX file (22 pages), plus 7 figures in .jpg","Foundations of Physics 17 (1987) 239-296",,,"physics.class-ph",,"  Some recent experiments, performed at Berkeley, Cologne, Florence and Vienna
led to the claim that something seems to travel with a speed larger than the
speed c of light in vacuum. Various other experimental results seem to point in
the same direction: For instance, localized wavelet-type solutions of Maxwell
equations have been found, both theoretically and experimentally, that travel
with Superluminal speed. Even muonic and electronic neutrinos --it has been
proposed-- might be ""tachyons"", since their square mass appears to be negative;
not to mention the apparent Superluminal expansions observed in the core of
quasars and, recently, in the so-called galactic microquasars. In the first
part of this paper we verify, on the basis of the numerical solution of Maxwell
equations, that waves propagating down a microwave guide can travel with
Superluminal group velocity, just confirming some of the previously mentioned
experimental results. Then, we have to face the question of Superluminal
motions within the theory of Special Relativity. It is not widely recognized
that all such theoretical and experimental results do not place relativistic
causality in jeopardy. For instance, it is possible (at least in microphysics)
to solve also the known causal paradoxes, devised for ""faster than light""
motion. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the oldest causal
paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of many further
tachyon paradoxes. The key to the solution is a careful application of tachyon
mechanics, as it unambiguously follows from Special Relativity. [Subj-classes:

state admits two different teleportation protocols. These two protocols refer
to the different kinds of joint measurements that may be made by the sender.
One protocol is the recently implemented quadrature phase approach of
Braunstein and Kimble[Phys. Rev. Lett.{\bf 80}, 869 (1998)]. The other is based
on recognising that a two mode squeezed vacuum state is also entangled with
respect to photon number difference and phase sum. We show that this protocol
can also realise teleportation, however limitations can arise due to the fact
that the photon number spectrum is bounded from below by zero. Our examples
show that a given entanglement resource may admit more than a single
teleportation protocol and the question then arises as to what is the optimum
protocol in the general case.
