X-ray source AXJ2019+112, a.k.a. ``The Dark Cluster'' (Hattori et al 1997).
Using deep V,I Keck images and wide-field K_s imaging from the NTT, a tight red
sequence of galaxies is identified within a radius of 0.2 h^{-1} Mpc of the
known z=1.01 elliptical lensing galaxy. The sequence, which includes the
central elliptical galaxy, has a slope in good agreement with the model
predictions of Kodama et al (1998) for z~1. We estimate the integrated
rest-frame luminosity of the cluster to be L_V > 3.2 x 10^{11}h^{-2}L_{\sun}
(after accounting for significant extinction at the low latitude of this
field), more than an order of magnitude higher than previous estimates. The
central region of the cluster is deconvolved using the technique of Magain,
Courbin & Sohy (1998), revealing a thick central arc coincident with an
extended radio source. All the observed lensing features are readily explained
by differential magnification of a radio loud AGN by a shallow elliptical
potential. The QSO must lie just outside the diamond caustic, producing two
images, and the arc is a highly magnified image formed from a region close to
the center of the host galaxy, projecting inside the caustic. The
mass--to--light ratio within an aperture of 0.4 h ^{-1} Mpc is M_x/L_V=
224^{+112}_{-78}h(M/L_V)_{\sun}, using the X-ray temperature. The strong lens
model yields a compatible value, M/L_V= 372^{+94}_{-94}h(M/L_V)_{\sun}, whereas
an independent weak lensing analysis sets an upper limit of M/L_V <520
h(M/L_V)_{\sun}, typical of massive clusters.

computed by calculating the ratio of the flux reflected by a planet (integrated
over wavelength) to the total stellar flux incident on the planet. This
quantity is useful for estimating the effective temperature and evolution of a
planet. We find it is sensitive to the stellar type of the primary. For a 5
M_Jup planet the Bond albedo varies from 0.4 to 0.3 to 0.06 as the primary star
varies from A5V to G2V to M2V in spectral type. It is relatively insensitive to
the effective temperature and gravity for cloud--free planets. Water clouds
increase the reflectivity of the planet in the red, which increases the Bond
albedo. The Bond albedo increases by an order of magnitude for a 13 M_Jup
planet with an M2V primary when water clouds are present. Silicate clouds, on
the other hand, can either increase or decrease the Bond albedo, depending on
whether there are many small grains (the former) or few large grains (the
latter).

After an encounter, many of the simulated asteroids develop the same rotation
rate and distinctive shape (i.e., highly elongated with a single convex side,
tapered ends, and small protuberances swept back against the rotation

alpha-omega mean field dynamo model where the local helicity generates a radial
field component from an azimuthal field. The subsequent shearing of the radial
field gives rise to exponentially growing dynamo modes. There are several
problems with this model. The exponentiation time for the galactic dynamo is
hard to calculate, but is probably uncomfortably long. Moreover, numerical
simulations of magnetic fields in shearing flows indicate that the presence of
a dynamo does not depend on a non-zero average helicity. However, these
difficulties can be overcome by including a fluctuating helicity driven by
hydrodynamic or magnetic instabilities. Unlike traditional disk dynamo models,
this `incoherent' dynamo does not depend on the presence of systematic fluid
helicity or any kind of vertical symmetry breaking. It will depend on geometry,
in the sense that the dynamo growth rate becomes smaller for very thin disks,
in agreement with constraints taken from the study of X-ray novae. In this
picture the galactic dynamo will operate efficiently, but the resulting field
will have a radial coherence length which is a fraction of the galactic radius.

absorbing region is a stellar ejecta nebula. The expansion velocity and
emission measure of the nebula are consistent with those seen in ejecta nebulae
of luminous blue variables. Previous low-dispersion spectra have detected a
strong [N II]5755 line, indicating an electron density of 3-12x10^5 cm^{-3}. We

overpredicts the abundance of M ~< 0.1M_* halos at all redshifts. (3) Finally,
we discuss the assembly of these halos, in particular the merger rate of

relatively low mass (few X 10^{10} M_\odot) and young ages (few X 10^8 yr). It

diversity of the astronomical observations, as well as in the experimental and
theoretical understanding of the atomic nucleus and of its spontaneous or

the fact that large varieties of nuclei have to be dealt with, these nuclei are
immersed in highly unusual environments which may have a significant impact on
their static properties, the diversity of their transmutation modes, and on the

FWHM of only 0.5+-0.2 Hz during small time intervals (32-s of data), and showed
erratic shifts in the centroid frequency between 5.5 and 8 Hz. The rms
amplitude over the energy range 2-60 keV was 5.6%+-0.2%. The amplitude
increased with photon energy from 3.7%+-0.5% between 2.8 and 5.3 keV to

at maximum only 40% (for a companion star with cosmic abundances), but most
likely ~20% (for a helium companion star) of the Eddington accretion limit.

investigate the limit behavior of random walks in multi-connected spaces and on
non-commutative groups related to the knot theory. We discuss the application
of the above mentioned problems in statistical physics of polymer chains. On
the basis of non-commutative probability theory we derive some new results in

by the Fermi surface topology. Electrons near Brillouin zone boundaries,
special symmetry points, or accidental degeneracy lines have spin flip rates
much higher than an average electron. A realistic calculation and analytical
estimates show that these regions dominate the spin relaxation, explaining why
polyvalent metals have much higher spin relaxation rates (up to three orders of
magnitude) than similar monovalent metals. This suggests that spin relaxation
in metals can be tailored by band-structure modifications like doping,
alloying, reducing the dimensionality, etc.

  Phys.Rev.D","Phys.Rev. D59 (1999) 103505","10.1103/PhysRevD.59.103505",,"hep-ph astro-ph gr-qc",,"  We study the adiabatic density perturbation in the {\it oscillating
inflation}, proposed by Damour and Mukhanov. The recent study of the
cosmological perturbation during reheating shows that the adiabatic fluctuation
behaves like as the perfect fluid and no significant amplification occurs on
super-horizon scales. In the oscillating inflation, however, the accelerated
expansion takes place during the oscillating stage and there might be a
possibility that the parametric amplification on small scales affects the
adiabatic long-wavelength perturbation. We analytically show that the density
perturbation neglecting the metric perturbation can be amplified by the
parametric resonance and the instability band becomes very broad during the
oscillating inflation. We examined this issue by solving the evolution equation
for perturbation numerically. We found that the parametric resonance is
strongly suppressed for the long wave modes comparable to the Hubble horizon.
The result indicates that the metric perturbation plays a crucial role for the
evolution of scalar field perturbation. Therefore, in the single field case,
there would be no significant imprint of the oscillating inflation on the
primordial spectrum of the adiabatic perturbation. However, it could be
expected that the oscillating inflation in the multi-field system gives the
enormous amplification on large scales, which may lead to the production of the
primordial black holes.
