in the unusually gas-rich, oval distortion of the Seyfert galaxy NGC4151. The
gas dynamics of the oval are found to be consistent with those of a
kinematically weak bar, fully confirming previous suggestions for the presence
of a fat bar, and, for the first time, individual gaseous features in the bar
are spatially resolved. In particular, the two bright regions close to the
leading edges of the bar in NGC4151 exhibit kinematics strikingly similar to
the signature of bar shocks seen in gas-dynamical simulations, and demonstrate
how strong the gaseous response may be even in such a weak bar potential. The
residual velocity field, showing deviations from circular motion, is largely
consistent with streaming in a bar potential, and, in addition, clearly shows
that inflow is concentrated in narrow regions originating in the shocks. This
inflow may represent an early stage in the fuelling process of the AGN.
  The presence and properties of the shocks in NGC4151 indicate that, in
addition to the x_1 orbits, the family of x_2 orbits exist and are of
significant extent in the bar of NGC4151, with gas streaming from the shocks
making the transition between the two families. We therefore suggest that the
circumnuclear ellipse, identified optically by previous authors and associated
with gas flowing in x_2 orbits, has formed as a natural consequence of the gas
flows in the bar without the requirement for a second, inner bar.
  Observations of HI were previously thought to be ill-suited to the study of
bar shocks due to limitations in angular resolution and sensitivity. However,
our observations show that, following recent instrumental enhancements, such
measurements are now feasible, albeit at the limits of instrumental capability.

21cm absorption associated with optically selected Mg II absorption line

supports the hypothesis that these sources are reddened by dust, as opposed to
having an intrinsically red spectrum due to the AGN emission mechanism. The
lower limits to the spin temperatures for the neutral hydrogen are between 50 K
and 1000 K, assuming a Galactic dust-to-gas ratio. We consider the question of
biases in optically selected samples of quasars due to dust obscuration. The
data on the red quasar sub-sample support the models of Fall and Pei for dust
obscuration by damped Ly alpha absorption line systems, and suggest that: (i)
there may be a significant, but not dominant, population of quasars missing
from optically selected samples due to dust obscuration, perhaps as high as 20%

(RXTE) observations of the black hole candidate GX 339-4 that were taken during
its hard/low state. On long time scales, the RXTE All Sky Monitor data reveal
evidence of a 240 day periodicity, comparable to timescales expected from
warped, precessing accretion disks. On short timescales all observations save
one show evidence of a persistent f approximately equal to 0.3 Hz QPO. The
broad band (10^{-3}-10^2 Hz) power appears to be dominated by two independent
processes that can be modeled as very broad Lorentzians with Q approximately
less than 1. The coherence function between soft and hard photon variability
shows that if these are truly independent processes, then they are individually
coherent, but they are incoherent with one another. This is evidenced by the
fact that the coherence function between the hard and soft variability is near
unity between 0.005-10 Hz but shows evidence of a dip at f approximately equal
to 1 Hz. This is the region of overlap between the broad Lorentzian fits to the
PSD. Similar to Cyg X-1, the coherence also drops dramatically at frequencies
approximately greater than 10 Hz. Also similar to Cyg X-1, the hard photon
variability is seen to lag the soft photon variability with the lag time
increasing with decreasing Fourier frequency. The magnitude of this time lag
appears to be positively correlated with the flux of GX 339-4. We discuss all
of these observations in light of current theoretical models of both black hole

the I_[C II]/I_CO and I_[C I]/I_CO line ratios on the metallicity. We show how
to modify it to include the effects of density and radiation field, and we have
compared it with observational data. We find that the model explains the
observed trend of enhanced [C II]/CO line ratio with decreasing metallicity as
the natural result of the augmented fraction of photodissociated gas in a
clump. We show that enhanced [C II]/CO ratios can be produced by lowering the
upper limit of the clump size distribution, as may happen in 30 Doradus. We
also find that the available data favors a [C I]/CO intensity ratio essentially
independent of metallicity, albeit the paucity of observations does not exclude
other possibilities. This is difficult to understand if most of the C is

observed with ASCA often can be well described by a power law with photon index
of 1.7--2.2 and are not consistent with significant contribution of the soft
spectral component to the total luminosity. For a blackbody spectrum with
temperature of 0.2--2 keV the upper limits correspond to <10--20% of the total
0.5--10 keV luminosity. On the other hand, theoretical calculations predict
that in the case of a Keplerian accretion disk around a slowly rotating neutron
star (with radius of 3Rg) ~2/3 of the total gravitational energy released in
the system can be released in the boundary layer between the inner part of the
accretion disk and the neutron star surface.

inclination. For such aspects, the SED shortward of ~80 microns is particularly
insensitive to orientation, since short wavelength disk emission is dominated
by superheated surface layers which are optically thin. The SED of a nearly

clusters at z~1.5. Most excess galaxies are best fit as 2--3 Gyr old
ellipticals, but some are either 4--5 Gyr old or considerably more metal-rich,
and others must be extremely dusty. The latter are part of a ``J-band dropout''
population which includes a number of galaxies in one field which are probably
at z~2.5, background to the quasar.
  Finally, I discuss narrowband redshifted H-alpha imaging in two fields which
has yielded at least one detection. At z>1.3 cluster galaxy star formation
rates can be measured from H-alpha in the near-IR, rest-frame 1500-Angstrom
light in the optical, and eventually rest-frame far-IR emission using SCUBA, to
help determine the star formation histories of cluster galaxies as function of
redshift.

Malmquist bias is reduced by grouping and corrected in forward or inverse
analyses of inferred distances, (b) the smoothing into a radial velocity field
is optimized to reduce window and sampling biases, (c) the density is derived
from the velocity using an improved nonlinear approximation, and (d) the
computational errors are made negligible. The method is tested and optimized
using mock catalogs based on an N-body simulation that mimics our cosmological

III catalog, with ~3300 grouped galaxies, allows a reliable reconstruction with
fixed Gaussian smoothing of 10-12 Mpc/h out to ~60 Mpc/h. We present maps of
the 3D velocity and mass-density fields and the corresponding errors. The
typical systematic and random errors in the density fluctuations inside 40
Mpc/h are \pm 0.13 and \pm 0.18. The recovered mass distribution resembles in
its gross features the galaxy distribution in redshift surveys and the mass
distribution in a similar POTENT analysis of a complementary velocity catalog

The reconstruction inside ~40 Mpc/h is not affected much by a revised
calibration of the distance indicators (VM2, tailored to match the velocities
from the IRAS 1.2Jy redshift survey). The bulk velocity within the sphere of
radius 50 Mpc/h about the Local Group is V_50=370 \pm 110 km/s (including
systematic errors), and is shown to be mostly generated by external mass
fluctuations. With the VM2 calibration, V_50 is reduced to 305 \pm 110 km/s.

well fit by a Gaussian profile with a mean value of m_V^0=23.67 +/- 0.07 mag
and sigma=1.39 +/- 0.06 mag (compared to m_V^0=23.74 mag and sigma=1.44 mag
from an earlier study using the same data by Whitmore it et al. 1995). The GCLF
in five radial bins is found to be statistically the same at all points,
showing no clear evidence of dynamical destruction processes based on the
luminosity function (LF), in contradiction to the claim by Gnedin (1997).
Similarly, there is no obvious correlation between the half light radius of the
clusters and the galactocentric distance. The core radius of the globular
cluster density distribution is R_c=56'', considerably larger than the core of
the stellar component (R_c=6.8''). The mean color of the cluster candidates is
V-I=1.09 mag which corresponds to an average metallicity of Fe/H = -0.74 dex.
The color distribution is bimodal everywhere, with a blue peak at V-I=0.95 mag
and a red peak at V-I=1.20 mag. The red population is only 0.1 magnitude bluer
than the underlying galaxy, indicating that these clusters formed late in the
metal enrichment history of the galaxy and were possibly created in a burst of
star/cluster formation 3-6 Gyr after the blue population. We also find that
both the red and the blue cluster distributions have a more elliptical shape
(Hubble type E3.5) than the nearly spherical galaxy. The average half light
radius of the clusters is ~2.5 pc which is comparable to the 3 pc average
effective radius of the Milky Way clusters, though the red candidates are ~20%
smaller than the blue ones.

using a hierarchical scaling ansatz for the 3-point correlation function.
Scale-invariant solutions derived earlier by Davis and Peebles are then used in

($h \to $ const.), to obtain an expression for the asymptotic value of $h$, in
terms of the power law index of clustering, $\gamma$,and the tangential and

that tangential dispersions are larger than radial ones, in the non-linear

of the solution demonstrates that the allowed asymptotic values of $h$,
consistent with the stable clustering hypothesis, lie in the range $0 \leq h

hierarchical model for the 3-pt function) is correct, the standard stable

blocks the flow of current through the grain, an effect known as the Coulomb
blockade. Current can flow only if two charge states of the grain have the same
energy; in this case the conductance has a peak. In a small grain with
quantized electron states, referred to as a quantum dot, the magnitude of the
conductance peak is directly related to the magnitude of the wavefunction near
the contacts to the dot. Since dots are generally irregular in shape, the
dynamics of the electrons is chaotic, and the characteristics of Coulomb
blockade peaks reflects those of wavefunctions in chaotic systems. Previously,
a statistical theory for the peaks was derived by assuming these wavefunctions
to be completely random. Here we show that the specific internal dynamics of
the dot, even though it is chaotic, modulates the peaks: because all systems
have short-time features, chaos is not equivalent to randomness. Semiclassical
results are derived for both chaotic and integrable dots, which are
surprisingly similar, and compared to numerical calculations. We argue that
this modulation, though unappreciated, has already been seen in experiments.

locus for the vertex weights. A symmetry of the partition function under
transformations of the vertex weights, which is fundamental to the solution in
both cases, can be understood in the random graph case as a change of
integration variable in the matrix integral used to define the model.

may have a role to play in the discretisation of Lorentzian metric quantum

mass, the differently viewed Born field is static and joins a static field
outside the external shell; no radiation is produced. We discuss gravitational
analogues of these phenomena. When a massive spherical shell is accelerated, an
untouched test mass inside experiences a uniform gravity field and accelerates
parallelly to the surrounding shell. In the strong gravity regime we illustrate
these effects using exact conformastatic solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell
equations with charged dust. We consider a massive charged shell on which the
forces due to nearly uniform electrical and gravitational fields balance. Both
fields are reduced inside by the ratio of the g_00 inside the shell to that
away from it. The acceleration of a free test particle, relative to a static
observer, is reduced correspondingly. We give physical explanations of these
effects.

simplifying approximations, we find a non-zero chiral condensate. However we
also find that the spectral density diverges for small eigenvalues, so that the
chiral condensate, at zero quark mass, diverges in quenched QCD. The degree of
divergence decreases with the instanton density, so that it is negligible for
the smallest number of cooling sweeps but becomes substantial for larger number
of cools. We show that the spectral density scales, that finite volume
corrections are small and we see evidence for the screening of topological
charges. However we also find that the spectral density and chiral condensate
vary rapidly with the number of cooling sweeps -- unlike, for example, the
topological susceptibility. Whether the problem lies with the cooling or with
the identification of the topological charges is an open question. This problem
needs to be resolved before one can determine how important is the divergence

The effective masses of the $\chi$ particles may be very small at the moment

When the particles $\chi$ become sufficiently heavy, they rapidly decay to
other, lighter particles. This leads to an almost instantaneous reheating

$10^{17}-10^{18}$ GeV. This mechanism works in the usual inflationary models

limited to gluon states or states where quark masses can be neglected. This
paper builds on the previous work by including particle masses
non-perturbatively, which is necessary for a full treatment of QCD. We show
that several subtle new issues are encountered when including masses
non-perturbatively. The method with masses is algebraically and conceptually

if the QCD scale parameter is used as unique independent variable instead of
moduli, the resulting Picard-Fuchs systems are represented by a single ordinary
differential equation (ODE) whose order coincides with the total number of
independent periods. This paper discusses some properties of these Picard-Fuchs
ODEs. In contrast with the usual Picard-Fuchs systems written in terms of
moduli derivatives, there exists a Wronskian for this ordinary differential
system and this Wronskian produces a new relation among periods, moduli and QCD
scale parameter, which in the case of SU(2) is reminiscent of scaling relation
of prepotential. On the other hand, in the case of the SU(3) theory, there are
two kinds of ordinary differential equations, one of which is the equation
directly constructed from periods and the other is derived from the SU(3)
Picard-Fuchs equations in moduli derivatives identified with Appell's $F_4$
hypergeometric system, i.e., Burchnall's fifth order ordinary differential
equation published in 1942. It is shown that four of the five independent
solutions to the latter equation actually correspond to the four periods in the
SU(3) gauge theory and the closed form of the remaining one is established by
the SU(3) Picard-Fuchs ODE. The formula for this fifth solution is a new one.

the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture concerning the wall-crossing formula for the
Donaldson invariants of a four-manifold with b^+ = 1. The conjecture asserts
that the wall-crossing terms due to changes in the metric depend at most on the
homotopy type of the four-manifold and the degree of the invariant. Our
principal interest in this conjecture is due to the fact that its proof is
expected to resemble that of an important intermediate step towards a proof of
Witten's conjecture concerning the relation between Donaldson and
Seiberg-Witten invariants (hep-th/9411102, hep-th/9709193), using PU(2)
monopoles as described in (dg-ga/9709022, dg-ga/9712005). Moreover, it affords
us another venue in which to address some of the technical difficulties arising
in our work on Witten's conjecture. The additional difficulties in the case of
PU(2) monopoles are due to the more complicated gluing theory, the presence of
obstructions to deformation and gluing, and the need to consider links of
positive-dimensional families of `reducibles' even in the presence of `simple
type' assumptions. Witten's conjecture should then follow from a final step
analogous to Goettsche's computation of the wall-crossing terms, assuming that
the Kotschick-Morgan conjecture holds (alg-geom/9506018).

  $\lim_{t\to0} M''(t) = \infty$ or $M''(0) = 0$ and $M''(t)>0$ for all $t>0$.
The fact that surjective isometries of any rearrangement-invariant function
space have to preserve disjointness has been determined before. However
dropping the assumption of surjectivity invalidates the general method. In this
paper we use a differential technique.

factor of 2-3. Since the calculated e+e- spectra are relatively insensitive to
the equation of state for initial conditions that fit the observed hadronic

than so far considered, or the presence of hitherto unidentified additional

presented which can be considered to be a discrete analogue of the Painleve V
equation. Its derivation is based on the similarity reduction on the
two-dimensional lattice of integrable partial difference equations of KdV type.
The new equation which is referred to as GDP (generalised discrete Painleve
equation) contains various ``discrete Painleve equations'' as subcases for
special values/limits of the parameters, some of which were already given
before in the literature. The general solution of the GDP can be expressed in
terms of Painleve VI (PVI) transcendents. In fact, continuous PVI emerges as
the equation obeyed by the solutions of the discrete equation in terms of the
lattice parameters rather than the lattice variables that label the lattice
sites. We show that the bilinear form of PVI is embedded naturally in the
lattice systems leading to the GDP. Further results include the establishment
of Baecklund and Schlesinger transformations for the GDP, the corresponding
isomonodromic deformation problem, and the self-duality of its bilinear scheme.
