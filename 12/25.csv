described here using relativistic theory of astronomical reference frames so as
to determine the Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters of binary systems. We
apply successive Lorentz transformations and the relativistic equation of light
propagation to establish the exact treatment of Doppler effect in binary
systems both in special and general relativity theories. As a result, the
Doppler shift is a sum of (1) linear in $c^{-1}$ terms, which include the
ordinary Doppler effect and its variation due to the secular radial
acceleration of the binary with respect to observer; (2) terms proportional to
$c^{-2}$, which include the contributions from the quadratic Doppler effect
caused by the relative motion of binary star with respect to the Solar system,
motion of the particle emitting light and diurnal rotational motion of
observer, orbital motion of the star around the binary's barycenter, and
orbital motion of the Earth; and (3) terms proportional to $c^{-2}$, which
include the contributions from redshifts due to gravitational fields of the
star, star's companion, Galaxy, Solar system, and the Earth. After
parameterization of the binary's orbit we find that the presence of
periodically changing terms in the Doppler schift enables us disentangling
different terms and measuring, along with the well known Keplerian parameters
of the binary, four additional post-Keplerian parameters, including the
inclination angle of the binary's orbit, $i$. We briefly discuss feasibility of
practical implementation of these theoretical results, which crucially depends
on further progress in the technique of precision Doppler measurements.

the introduction of the regularization function to the Lagrangian. The
reasonable values of the pion mass, the pion decay constant and the quark

square and the pion decay constant are almost proportional to the current quark
mass up to the strange quark mass region. It suggests that the chiral

D-string acts as a source for the Ramond-Ramond two-form which induces an
additional (lower) form due to its coupling to the U(1) gauge invariant fields
on the D-string. These forms are reviewed in this formalism for an arbitrary
D-string and is encoded in the Wess-Zumino action. Quantization of the D-string

N-Sigma (IJ = (1/2)1, (1/2)0, (3/2)1, (3/2)0) channels fit the N-N, N-Lambda
and N-Sigma scattering data reasonably well. This model predicts: There are
rather strong effective attractions between decuplet-baryons; the effective
attractions between octet-baryons are weak or even repulsive; and the
attractions between decuplet- and octet-baryons lie in between.

between two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) solitons (including the case of
2D vortex solitons) belonging to two different modes which are incoherently
coupled by cross-phase modulation. The derivation is based on calculation of
the interaction term in the full Hamiltonian of the system. An essential
peculiarity is that, in the 3D case, as well as in the case of 2D solitons with
unequal masses, the main contribution to the interaction potential originates
from a vicinity of one or both solitons, similarly to what was recently found
in the 2D and 3D single-mode systems, while in the case of identical 2D
solitons, the dominating area covers all the space between the solitons. Unlike
the single-mode systems,_stable_ bound states of mutually orbiting solitons are
shown to be possible in the bimodal system.

The method is based on the general approach to calculation of scattering or

motions of the particles and have a wide area of application. Numeric
estimations of anomalous absorption for different conditions are carried out.

quantum mechanics, Feynman advocated that Pauli's exclusion principle can be
completely ignored in intermediate states of perturbation theory. He observed
that all virtual processes (of the same order) that violate the Pauli principle
cancel out. Feynman accordingly introduced a prescription, which is to
disregard the Pauli principle in all intermediate processes. This ingeneous
trick is of crucial importance in the Feynman diagram technique. We show,
however, an example in which Feynman's prescription fails. This casts doubts on
the general validity of Feynman's prescription.
