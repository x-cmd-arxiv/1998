  To appear in Physics Reports",,"10.1016/S0370-1573(98)00106-9",,"astro-ph",,"  Due to the clumpy nature of the self gravitating gas composing the
interstellar medium, it is not clear whether galactic gas dynamics can be
discussed in terms of standard hydrodynamics. Nevertheless, it is clear that
certain generic properties related to orbital structure in a given potential
and the effect of dissipation can be used to qualitatively understand gas
motion in galaxies. The effect of dissipation is examined in triaxial galaxy
potentials with and without rotating time dependent components. In the former
case, dissipative trajectories settle around closed loop orbits when these
exist. When they do not, e.g., inside a constant density core, then the only
attractor is the centre and this leads to mass inflow. This provides a self
regulating mechanism for accession of material towards the centre --- since the
formation of a central masses destroys the central density core and eventually
stops the accession. In the case when a rotating bar is present, there are
usually several types of attractors, including those on which long lived
chaotic motion can occur (strange attractors). Motion on these is erratic with
large radial and vertical oscillations.

625--825 Hz and a faint broad (FWHM 91 Hz) peak. When the two peaks appeared
simultaneously the separation was 333 +/- 5 Hz. Six type I thermonuclear bursts
were detected, of which five exhibited almost coherent oscillations near 330
Hz, which makes 4U 1702-429 only the second source to show burst oscillations
very close to the kilohertz QPO separation frequency. The energy spectrum and
color-color diagram indicate that the source executed variations in the range
between the ``island'' and ``lower banana'' atoll states. In addition to the
kilohertz variability, oscillations at ~10, ~35, and 80 Hz were also detected
at various times, superimposed on a red noise continuum. The centroid of the
\~35 Hz QPO tracks the frequency of the kilohertz oscillation when they were
both present. A Lense-Thirring gravitomagnetic precession interpretation
appears more plausible in this case, compared to other atoll sources with low
frequency QPOs.

modified equation can be used to model the behaviour of an overdense region
over a sufficiently large range of $\delta$. The key new idea is a Taylor
series expansion in ($1/\delta$) to model the non-linear epoch. We show that
the modified equations quite generically lead to the formation of stable
structures in which the gravitational collapse is halted at around the virial

symmetric flows onto black holes have shown that it is possible to produce
stationary shock waves with a stable position both for ideal inviscid and for
moderately viscous accretion disks.
  We perform several two dimensional numerical simulations of accretion flows
in the equatorial plane to study shock stability against non-axisymmetric
azimuthal perturbations. We find a peculiar new result. A very small
perturbation seems to produce an instability as it crosses the shock, but after
some small oscillations, the shock wave suddenly transforms into an asymmetric
closed pattern, and it stabilizes with a finite radial extent, despite the
inflow and outflow boundary conditions are perfectly symmetric. The main
characteristics of the final flow are: 1) The deformed shock rotates steadily
without any damping. It is a permanent feature and the thermal energy content
and the emitted energy vary periodically with time. 2) This behavior is also
stable against further perturbations. 3) The average shock is still very strong
and well defined, and its average radial distance is somewhat larger than that
of the original axially symmetric circular shock. 4) Shocks obtained with
larger angular momentum exhibit more frequencies and beating phenomena. 5) The
oscillations occur in a wide range of parameters, so this new effect may have
relevant observational consequences, like (quasi) periodic oscillations, for
the accretion of matter onto black holes. Typical time scales for the periods
are 0.01 and 1000 seconds for black holes with 10 and 1 million solar mass,
respectively.

cooling and accreting neutron stars, which are not active as radio pulsars, as
observed with the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and compare it with theoretical
expectations. So far, only one isolated neutron star is identified optically
among ROSAT sources, namely RXJ185635-3754 (Walter & Matthews 1997). Three more
promising candidates have been suggested. In addition, several upper limit
estimates are available on the space density of such neutron stars from
different optical follow-up studies. We show that the log N - log S curve
according to the current observations, including the identified neutron star,
the three additional candidates, and the upper limits, lies between the
theoretical expectations for middle-aged cooling neutron stars and old
accreting neutron stars. At least one of the neutron star candidates found so
far with ROSAT may be cooling instead of accreting. We suggest that the fact
that more accreting isolated old neutron stars were expected (e.g., Madau &
Blaes 1994) than observed is mostly due to the velocity distribution used in
those calculations. More recent radio observations indicate that there are
fewer slow neutron stars, ie., fewer accreting X-ray bright old neutron stars.
At the X-ray bright end of the log N - log S curve, however, the ROSAT
observations agree well with the theoretical expectations.

shown tractable for conjunctive queries of bounded treewidth and of bounded
degree of cyclicity. The so far most general concept of nearly acyclic queries
was the notion of queries of bounded query-width introduced by Chekuri and
Rajaraman (1997). While CQs of bounded query width are tractable, it remained
unclear whether such queries are efficiently recognizable. Chekuri and
Rajaraman stated as an open problem whether for each constant k it can be
determined in polynomial time if a query has query width less than or equal to
k. We give a negative answer by proving this problem NP-complete (specifically,
for k=4). In order to circumvent this difficulty, we introduce the new concept
of hypertree decomposition of a query and the corresponding notion of hypertree
width. We prove: (a) for each k, the class of queries with query width bounded
by k is properly contained in the class of queries whose hypertree width is
bounded by k; (b) unlike query width, constant hypertree-width is efficiently
recognizable; (c) Boolean queries of constant hypertree width can be
efficiently evaluated.

a classical analogue for this quantum phenomenon and use it to construct a
classical analogue for black hole radiation. The radiation spectrum in quantum
field theory has the power spectrum as its classical analogue. Monochromatic
light is continually reflected off a moving mirror or the silvered surface of a
collapsing star.The reflected light is fourier analysed by the observer and the
power spectrum is constructed. For a mirror moving along the standard black
hole trajectory,it is seen that the power spectrum has a ``thermal'' nature.
Mirror-observer configurations like an inertial mirror observed in an
accelerated observer's frame and an accelerated mirror observed in a Rindler
frame are investigated and conditions for obtaining a ``thermal'' power
spectrum are derived.The corresponding results in the black hole case are then
elucidated.It is seen that a ``thermal'' spectrum can arise either due to the
collapse of the star or due to the motion of the observer in the Schwarzchild
spacetime. The ``temperature'' of the Planckian spectrum seen is therefore
dependent on whether the star or the observer is in motion.In the latter case
it is possible to obtain a ``temperature'' which is entirely independent of the

transport equation for the distribution function for hard charged scalars in a
perturbative expansion that includes hard thermal loop resummation. Solving
this transport equation, the infrared divergences arising from absorption and
emission of soft quasi-static magnetic photons are manifest in logarithmic
secular terms. We then implement the dynamical renormalization group
resummation of these secular terms in the relaxation time approximation. The
distribution function (in the linearized regime) is found to approach
equilibrium as $\delta n_k(t) =\delta n_k(t_o) e^{-2\alpha T (t-t_o)
\ln[(t-t_o)\bar{\mu}]}$, with $\bar{\mu}\approx \omega_p$ the plasma frequency
and $\alpha =e^2/4\pi$. This anomalous relaxation is recognized to be the
square of the relaxation of the single particle propagator, providing a
generalization of the usual relation between the damping and the interaction
rate. The renormalization group approach to kinetics reveals clearly the time
scale $t_{rel} \approx (\alpha T \ln[1/\alpha])^{-1}$ arising from infrared

numbers. A method for determining whether Mersenne numbers are primes is
developed by using a geometrical representation of these numbers. The
connection between the non-existence of finite odd perfect numbers and the
irrationality of the square root of twice the product of a sequence of repunits
is investigated, and it is demonstrated, for an arbitrary number of prime
factors, that the products of the corresponding repunits will not equal twice
the square of a rational number.

Riemann-Roch number of certain G-spaces which are the finite dimensional models
of certain infinite dimensional spaces with Hamiltonian LG-actions, here T is a
maximal torus of the semi-simple Lie group G.
  Unlike its finite dimensional cousin, the formula obtained here only needs to
valuate on a finite subgroup of T depending on the 'level' of the LG-action and
the dual Coxeter number of G, due to a fundamental cancelation. If the
fixed-point sets of elements of the finite subgroup do not intersect the
compactification locus used in constructing the finite dimensional model, the
fixed point formula has a particularly simple form, which will be shown for the
case of Verlinde formula.

  in the Journal of Applied Meteorology, 1998",,,,"physics.ao-ph",,"  A warm cloud modification experiment was carried out in an area of 4800 Sq.Km
in the Pune region,India, during the 11-summer monsoon (June-September) seasons
(1973-74, 1976, 1979-86). A double-area cross-over design with area
randomization was adopted and an instrumented aircraft was used for seeding and
cloud physical measurements. Finely pulverised salt (sodium chloride) particles
were released into the monsoon clouds (cumulus and stratocumulus) during
aircraft penetrations into the clouds at a height of 200-300 m above the
cloud-base. The warm cloud responses to salt seeding are found to be critically
dependent on the cloud physical characteristics e.g., vertical thickness and
liquid water content. Clouds with vertical thickness greater than 1 km, LWC
greater than 0.5 gm/cubic m when seeded with salt particles (modal diameter 10
micro m, concentration 1 per litre of cloud air) produced increase in rainfall
of 24 per cent significant at 4 per cent level. Shallow clouds (vertical
thickness less than 1 km, LWC less than 0.5 gm/cubic m) when seeded showed
tendency for dissipation. The cloud physical observations made in not-seeded
(control) and seeded (target) clouds have provided some useful evidence to test
the applicability of the warm cloud modification hypothesis. The results of the
cloud model computations suggested that moderate convergence at the cloud-base
is essential for the cloud growth and development of precipitation in the real
world. Hygroscopic particle seeding of warm clouds under favourable dynamical
conditions (convergence at the cloud-base level) may result in the acceleration
of the collision-coalescence process resulting in the enhancement of rainfall.

  Bielefeld, Germany, November 1998",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Decoherence of a quantum system induced by the interaction with its
environment (measuring medium) may be presented phenomenologically as a
continuous (or repeated) fuzzy quantum measurement. The dynamics of the system
subject to continuous decoherence (measurement) may be described by the
complex-Hamiltonian Schroedinger equation, stochastic Schroedinger equation of
a certain type or (nonselectively) by the Lindblad master equation. The
formulation of this dynamics with the help of restricted path integrals shows
that the dynamics of the measured system depends only on the information
recorded in the environment. With the help of the complex-Hamiltonian
Schroedinger equation, monitoring a quantum transition is shown to be possible,
at the price of decreasing the transition probability (weak Zeno effect). The
monitoring of the level transition may be realized by a long series of short
weak observations of the system which resulting in controllable slow
decoherence.
