the universe evolved from its initial simplicity, as seen in measurements of
the Cosmic Microwave Background, to the universe we see today, with complexity
on all scales. While the diffuse background measurements of COBE reveal the
importance of the far infrared and submillimeter in early galaxy and star
formation, the understanding of the development of complex structure requires
high resolution imaging and spectroscopy.
  We present a concept for a space mission called SPECS, the Submillimeter
Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure, which provides these capabilities.
SPECS is a cold, spatial and spectral Michelson interferometer with adjustable
baselines ranging up to 1 km. It has Hubble sensitivity and angular resolution
in the far IR and submillimeter, spectral resolution up to 10,000, and a 14'
field of view. SPECS will be able to image thermal dust continuum and infrared
cooling and diagnostic line emission over a wide range of redshifts, providing
extinction-free astrophysical probes of young galaxies and early cosmic
structures, and measures of the luminosity and heavy element formation history
of the universe. SPECS would also have the potential to improve vastly our
knowledge of protostars, protoplanetary systems, Active Galactic Nuclei and
other objects in the local universe.
  We recommend that a concerted effort be made during the next decade to
develop and test certain critical technologies (photon-counting far IR
detectors, formation flying spacecraft, cold, lightweight mirrors, and active
coolers), so that SPECS can be deployed in about 2015.

percent for the Intracluster gas. We also propose a mechanism for the early
generation of Intracluster magnetic fields in terms of Galactic Winds. It
results in typical field strengths of about 0.1 microGauss. Such comparatively
weak fields are consistent with an inverse Compton origin of the excess EUV and
hard X-ray emission of the Coma cluster, given the radio synchrotron emission.
The required relativistic electrons must have been accelerated rather recently,
less than a few billion years ago, presumably in cluster accretion shocks. This
is in contrast to the hadronic nonthermal component which accumulates on
cosmological time scales, and whose pion-decay TeV gamma-ray emission is
expected to be larger, or of the same order as the inverse Compton TeV

Theory (or indeed any quantum theory of gravity) can be described by
conventional quantum mechanics. Although there is no contradiction with the
fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, one can prove that expectation
values of Heisenberg operators at fixed times cannot exist in an ordinary
asymptotic Lorentz frame. Only operators whose matrix elements between the
vacuum and energy eigenstates with energy greater than the Planck scale are
artificially cut off, can have conventional Green's functions. This implies a
Planck scale cutoff on the possible localization of measurements in time. A
similar behavior arises also in ``little string theories''. We argue that
conventional quantum mechanics in light cone time is compatible with the
properties of black holes if there are more than four non-compact flat
dimensions, and also with the properties of ``little string theories''. We
contrast these observations with what is known about M Theory in asymptotically

arbitrary pair of matrix theory objects are calculated at one-loop order. This
result generalizes previous calculations by including arbitrary fermionic
background field configurations. The interaction potential at orders 1/r^7 and
1/r^8 is shown to correspond precisely with the leading terms expected from
linearized supergravity interactions between arbitrary objects in M-theory.
General expressions for the stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current
of an arbitrary matrix configuration are derived, including fermionic
contributions. Supergravity effects which are correctly reproduced include
membrane/5-brane interactions, 0-brane/6-brane interactions,
supercurrent/supercurrent interactions and the spin contributions to moments of
the supergravity currents. The matrix theory description of the supergravity
stress tensor, membrane current and 5-brane current are used to propose an
explicit formulation of matrix theory in an arbitrary background metric and
3-form field.

  additions, in particular some new references to the work of Kashina",,,,"math.QA",,"  One of the classical notions of group theory is the notion of the exponent of
a group. The exponent of a group is the least common multiple of orders of its
elements.
  In this paper we generalize the notion of exponent to Hopf algebras. We give
five equivalent definitions of the exponent. Two of them are: 1) the exponent
of H equals the order of the Drinfeld element u of the quantum double D(H); 2)
the exponent of H is the order of the squared brading acting in the tensor
square of the regular representation of D(H).
  We show that the exponent is invariant under twisting. We prove that for
semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebras H, the exponent is finite and divides
dim(H)^3. For triangular Hopf algebras in characteristic zero, we show that the
exponent divides dim(H). We conjecture that if H is semisimple and cosemisimple
then the exponent always divides dim(H).
  At the end we formulate some open questions, in particular suggest a
formulation for a possible Hopf algebraic analogue of Sylow's theorem.

Poisson structure generalizes the linearized holonomy on a regular symplectic
foliation. However, for singular Poisson structures the linear holonomy is
defined for the lifts of tangential path to the cotangent bundle (cotangent
paths). The linear holonomy is closely related to the modular class studied by
A. Weinstein. Namely, the logarithm of the determinant of the linear holonomy
is equal to the integral of the modular vector field along such a lift. This
assertion relies on the notion of the integral of a vector field along a
cotangent path on a Poisson manifold, which is also introduced in the paper.
  In the second part of the paper we prove that for locally unimodular Poisson
manifolds the modular class is an invariant of Morita equivalence.

that the Hamiltonian and order parameters are based on pair distances only, and
