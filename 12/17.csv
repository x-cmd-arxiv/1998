rise of the recent X-ray outburst. The power spectral analysis of the first
observation reveals strong aperiodic X-ray variability of the source (~28%), as
well as the presence of a QPO at ~82 mHz with fractional rms amplitude ~14%
over the 2-60 keV energy range. Also apparent is the first harmonic of the QPO
with the amplitude ~9%. As the X-ray flux increases, the source tends to become
less variable, and the QPO frequency increases rapidly, from 82 mHz to 4 Hz,
over the flux (2-50 keV) range of 1.73-5.75 x 10^{-8} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The
amplitude of the fundamental component of the QPO varies little, while that of
the harmonic follows a decreasing trend. The fundamental component strengthens
toward high energies, while its harmonic weakens. Initially, the power spectrum
is roughly flat at low frequencies and turns into a power law at high
frequencies, with the QPO harmonic sitting roughly at the break. In later
observations, however, the high-frequency portion of the continuum can actually
be better described by a broken power law (as opposed to a simple power law).
This effect becomes more apparent at higher energies. The overall amplitude of
the continuum shows a similar energy dependence to that of the fundamental
component of the QPO. Strong rapid X-ray variability, as well as hard energy
spectrum, makes XTE J1550-564 a good black hole candidate. We compare its

power spectrum of matter and has a different shape which indicates that the
bias is time- and scale-dependent. At z=0, the halo power spectrum is
anti-biased with respect to the matter power spectrum at wavenumbers
k~[0.15-30]h/Mpc, and provides an excellent match to the power spectrum of the
APM galaxies at all probed k. In particular, it nicely matches the inflection
observed in the APM power spectrum at k~0.15h/Mpc. We complement the power
spectrum analysis with a direct estimate of bias using smoothed halo and matter
overdensity fields and show that the evolution observed in the simulation in
linear and mildly non-linear regimes can be well described by the analytical
model of Mo & White (1996), if the distinction between formation redshift of
halos and observation epoch is introduced into the model. We present arguments
and evidence that at higher overdensities, the evolution of bias is
significantly affected by dynamical friction and tidal stripping operating on
the satellite halos in high-density regions of clusters and groups; we
attribute the strong anti-bias observed in the halo correlation function and

to radio jets yet are not aligned with the galaxy isophotes. The timescale for
precession in the galaxy is short suggesting that an alternative mechanism
causes the gas disk to be misaligned with the galaxy. In M84 we estimate the
pressure on the disk required to overcome the torque from the galaxy and find
that it is small compared to the thermal pressure in the hot ambient ISM
estimated from the X-ray emission. We therefore propose that pressure gradients
in a jet associated hot interstellar medium exert a torque on the gas disk in
M84 causing it to be misaligned with the galaxy isophotal major axis. This
mechanism could explain the connection between gas disk angular momentum and
jet axes in nearby radio galaxies.
  By integrating the light of the galaxy through a warped gas and dust disk we
find that the geometry of gas disk in M84 is likely to differ that predicted
from a simple precession model. We find that the morphology of the gas disk in
M84 is consistent with a warped geometry where precession is caused by a
combination of a galactic torque and a larger torque due to pressure gradients
in the ambient X-ray emitting gas. Precession occurs at an axis between the jet
and galaxy major axis, but nearer to the jet axis implying that the pressure
torque is 2-4 times larger than the galactic torque. A better model to the
morphology of the disk is achieved when precession takes place about an
elliptical rather than circular path. This suggests that the isobars in the hot
medium are strongly dependent on angle from the jet axis.

superposition of two thermal components at temperatures of 0.4 keV and 6-8 keV.
The total emission is roughly equally divided between the two components, over
(0.5-4.5) keV. The harder component is consistent with an origin from stellar
sources; the softer component likely comes from hot gas. Lx of this hot gas is
not as large as expected for a global inflow, in a galaxy of an optical
luminosity as high as that of NGC3923. So, it is suggested that a substantial
amount of hot gas was removed by internal agents, and that this process was
helped by the flat mass distribution of the galaxy. Another possibility is that
gas was lost as a consequence of the episod of interaction or merger that
produced the system of shells visible in the optical band. Finally, the
possible origins of the large scatter in the X-ray emission shown by galaxies

galaxies reside in small groups, in which the ambient medium (if present)
cannot strip them of their hot gas; so, if only environmental factors are
invoked to lower Lx/Lb, the most effective mechanism must be galaxy
interactions. The lower Lx/Lb galaxies, though, are seen to occur across the

Omega Cen (NGC 5139) have been used to measure the luminosity function of main
sequence stars at the low-mass end. Two fields have been investigated, located
respectively ~4.6' and ~7' away from the cluster center, or near the half-light
radius of this cluster (~4.8'). The color-magnitude diagrams derived from these
data show the cluster main sequence extending to the detection limit at I ~ 24.
Information on both color and magnitude is used to build the luminosity
functions of main sequence stars in these fields and the two independent
determinations are found to agree very well with each other within the
observational uncertainty. Both functions show a peak in the stellar
distribution around M_I ~ 9 followed by a drop at fainter magnitudes well
before photometric incompleteness becomes significant, as is typical of other
globular clusters observed with the HST. This result is at variance with
previous claims that the luminosity function of Omega Cen stays flat at low
masses, but is in excellent agreement with recent near-IR NICMOS observations
of the same cluster.

factor is studied using direct Lanczos diagonalization of small systems and

value theta_c = 0.38 is reached at which the curvature (velocity) vanishes.
Beyond this point, which is distinct from the VBS point and the Lifshitz point,
the minimum lies at an incommensurate value that goes smoothly to 2pi/3 when
theta approaches pi/4, the Lai-Sutherland point. The mode remains isolated from
the other states: there is no evidence of spinon deconfinement before the point
theta =+pi/4. These findings explain recent observation of the magnetization

use a representation in which the $q\bar q$-pair has a definite transverse

a 3D BSE which is formally identical to its Covariant Instantaneity form, thus

importantly, the reconstructed 4D vertex functions in the covariant null-plane
ensure that 4D quark-loops are now free from ill-defined time-like momentum
integrations (which had plagued the earlier CIA vertex functions), while a
simple prescription of `Lorentz completion' in the new description yields a

Groebner basis methods to a range of combinatorial problems.
  Chapter Two contains the most important result, which is the application of
Knuth-Bendix procedures to Kan extensions, showing how rewriting provides a
useful method for attempting to solve a variety of combinatorial problems which
can be phrased in terms of Kan extensions.
  Chapter Three shows that the standard Knuth-Bendix algorithm is step-for-step
a special case of Buchberger's algorithm. The one-sided cases and higher
dimensions are considered.
  Chapter Four relates rewrite systems, Groebner bases and automata. Automata
which only accept irreducibles, and automata which output reduced forms are
discussed for presentations of Kan extensions. Reduction machines for rewrite
systems are identified with standard output automata and the reduction machines
devised for algebras are expressed as Petri nets.
  Chapter Five uses the completion of a group rewriting system to
algorithmically determine a contracting homotopy necessary in order to compute
the set of generators for the module of identities among relations using the
covering groupoid methods devised by Brown and Razak Salleh. Reducing the
resulting set of submodule generators is identified as a Groebner basis
problem. Algorithms are implemented in GAP3.

general Lagrangian invariant under point transformations containing first-order
derivatives only and imposing the constraint $\gamma_\mu \psi^\mu=0$, we
eliminate one of the spin-1/2 contributions. The resulting propagator provides
a clean separation of spin-3/2 proper and the one remaining spin-1/2
contribution. In addition to a conventional pole term describing pure spin-3/2,
which is identical to the propagator proposed by Williams, this procedure
yields a second pole term describing spin-1/2 only, with a pole at twice the
mass parameter of the Lagrangian. Its effect on physical observables may
manifest itself in a manner which is indistinguishable from a particle in its
own right. The second pole term cancels the $1/p^2$ singularity of the Williams
propagator and the propagator derived here is well behaved for vanishing $p^2$.

multipole, mechanical high-stop vibration isolator. The isolator, consisting of
a stack of metal disks connected by thin wires, attenuates frequencies in the
kilohertz range, and is suited to both vacuum and cryogenic environments. We
derive an approximate analytical model and compare its predictions for the
frequencies of the normal modes to those of a finite element analysis. The
analytical model is exact for the modes involving only motion along and
rotation about the longitudinal axis, and it gives a good approximate
description of the transverse modes. These results show that the high-frequency
behavior of a multi-stage isolator is well characterized by the natural
frequencies of a single stage. From the single-stage frequency formulae, we
derive relationships among the various geometrical parameters of the isolator
to guarantee equal attenuation in all degrees of freedom. We then derive
expressions for the attenuation attainable with a given isolator length, and
find that the most important limiting factor is the elastic limit of the spring
wire material. For our application, which requires attenuations of 250 dB at 1
kHz, our model specifies a six-stage design using brass disks of approximately
2 cm in both radius and thickness, connected by 3 cm steel wires of diameters
ranging from 25 to 75 microns. We describe the construction of this isolator in
detail, and compare measurements of the natural frequencies of a single stage
with calculations from the analytical model and the finite element package. For
translations along and rotations about the longitudinal axes, all three results
