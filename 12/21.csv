shows a very peculiar ``rounded triangular'' shape. However, in some other
cases, the curve can mimic a planetary occultation. Photometric variations due
to comet occultations are mainly achromatic. Nevertheless, if comets with small
periastrons have smaller particles, these occultations could be chromatic with
a larger extinction in the blue by few percents.
  We also estimate the number of detections expected in a large photometric
survey at high accuracy. By the observation of several tens of thousand of
stars, it should be possible to detect several hundreds of occultation per
year. We thus conclude that a spatial photometric survey would detect a large
number of extra-solar comets. This would allow to explore the time evolution of
cometary activity, and consequently would probe structure and evolution of

processes for H2 formation, we pursue the thermal and dynamical evolution of

population III stars. It is found that, almost independent of initial
conditions, a filamentary cloud continues to collapse nearly isothermally due
to H_2 cooling until the cloud becomes optically thick against the H_2 lines.
During the collapse the cloud structure separates into two parts, i.e., a
denser spindle and a diffuse envelope. The spindle contracts quasi-statically,
and thus the line mass of the spindle keeps a characteristic value determined
solely by the temperature ($\sim 800$ K). Applying a linear theory, we find
that the spindle is unstable against fragmentation during the collapse. The
wavelength of the fastest growing perturbation lessens as the collapse
proceeds. Consequently, successive fragmentation could occur. When the central
density exceeds $n_c \sim 10^{10-11} cm^{-3}$, the successive fragmentation may
cease since the cloud becomes opaque against the H_2 lines and the collapse
decelerates appreciably. The mass of the first star is then expected to be
typically $\sim 3 M_\odot$, which may grow up to $\sim 16 M_\odot$ by accreting
the diffuse envelope. Thus, the first-generation stars are anticipated to be
massive but not supermassive.

a QRPA shell model using ground-state deformations from the FRDM and ETFSI
models. Gamma-ray singles and coincidence spectroscopy has been performed for
Mn-64 and Mn-66 decays to levels of Fe-64 and Fe-66, revealing a significant
drop in the energy of the first 2+ state in these nuclides that suggests an
unanticipated increase in collectivity near N=40.

during alpha-decay, which has been suggested as a promissing tool to
investigate the problem of tunneling times. We show deviations of the numerical
results from the semiclassical estimates. A standard assumption of a preformed
particle inside the well leads to sharp high-frequency lines in the
bremsstrahlung emission. These lines correspond to ""quantum beats"" of the
internal part of the wavefunction during tunneling arising from the
interference of the neighboring resonances in the well.

related to the cross sections of the $\rho$ + pion and the $\rho$ + nucleon
reactions. A calculation based on an effective Lagrangian shows the importance
of including the direct $\rho\pi\to\rho\pi$ scattering which is dominated by
the $a_1$ exchange. A large broadening of the spectral function is found,
accompanied by a strength suppression at the pole.

investigated at room temperature. These hybrids consist of 300 mu-m thick GaAs
pixel detectors, flip-chip bonded to a CMOS Single Photon Counting Chip (PCC).
This chip consists of a matrix of 64 x 64 identical square pixels (170 mu-m x
170 mu-m) and covers a total area of 1.2 cm**2. The electronics in each cell
comprises a preamplifier, a discriminator with a 3-bit threshold adjust and a
15-bit counter. The detector is realized by an array of Schottky diodes
processed on semi-insulating LEC-GaAs bulk material. An IV-charcteristic and a
detector bias voltage scan showed that the detector can be operated with
voltages around 200 V. Images of various objects were taken by using a standard
X-ray tube for dental diagnostics. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) was also
determined. The applications of these imaging systems range from medical
applications like digital mammography or dental X-ray diagnostics to non
destructive material testing (NDT). Because of the separation of detector and
readout chip, different materials can be investigated and compared.

dimensions admits infinitely many Hamiltonian operators and is completely
integrable by Magri's theorem. This remarkable property holds in arbitrary
number of dimensions as well, so that among all integrable nonlinear evolution
equations the real homogeneous Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation is distinguished as
one that retains its character as an integrable system in multi-dimensions.
This property can be traced back to the appearance of arbitrary functions in
the Lagrangian formulation of the real homogeneous Monge-Amp\`ere equation
which is degenerate and requires use of Dirac's theory of constraints for its
Hamiltonian formulation. As in the case of most completely integrable systems
the constraints are second class and Dirac brackets directly yield the
Hamiltonian operators. The simplest Hamiltonian operator results in the
Kac-Moody algebra of vector fields and functions on the unit circle.
