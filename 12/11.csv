very deep UBVRIJHK images towards the HDF-South. Four elliptical profile
galaxies are identified in the redshift range z=1-2, all with very red SEDs,
implying ages of >2 Gyrs for standard passive evolution. We also find later
type IR-luminous galaxies at similarly high redshift, (10 objects with z>1,
H<25), whose weak UV emission implies single burst ages of >1 Gyr. The number
and luminosity-densities of these galaxies are comparable with the local
E/SO-Sbc populations for \Omega_m>0.2, and in the absence of a significant
cosmological constant, we infer that the major fraction of luminous
Hubble-sequence galaxies have evolved little since z~2. A highly complete
photometric redshift distribution is constructed to H=25 (69 galaxies) showing
a broad spread of redshift, peaking at z~1.5, in reasonable agreement with some
analyses of the HDF. Five `dropout' galaxies are detected at z~3.8, which are
compact in the IR, ~0.5 kpc/h at rest 3500\AA. No example of a blue IR luminous
elliptical is found, restricting the star-formation epoch of ellipticals to
z>10 for a standard IMF and modest extinction.

constant in time. We also measure a coherence consistent with unity in all

inconsistent with simple Comptonization models invoking a constant time delay.
Comptonization in a non-uniform medium can perhaps explain the lags. However,
the magnitudes of the lags imply that the hot electron gas extends to more than
1000 Schwarzschild radii. This may constitute an energy problem. We argue that
while a large hot cloud is possible for black holes which may hide some of
their accretion energy in advection, such a distribution may not be possible
neutron stars where all the accretion energy is eventually released at the
neutron star surface. This casts doubt on the Comptonization model, though the
energy problem may be resolved for example by a wind from the inner disk.

a combination of curvature and synchrotron components. The spectrum of
curvature component breaks at 150MeV, and neither its slope nor level below
this energy are compatible with phase-averaged spectra of pulsed X-ray emission
inferred from observations. Spectral properties in the combined energy range of
ROSAT and ASCA (0.1 - 10 keV) depend upon the location of cyclotron turnover
energy epsilon_ct=\hbar{e B \over m_e c} /sin(psi) in the synchrotron
component. Unlike in outer-gap models, the available range of pitch angles psi
is rather narrow and confined to low values. For classical pulsars, a gradual
turnover begins already at 1MeV, and the level of the synchrotron spectrum
decreases. At 10keV the curvature component eventually takes over, but with
photon index alpha = 2/3, in disagreement with observations. For millisecond
pulsars, the X-ray spectra are dominated by synchrotron component with alpha
\simeq 1.5, and a sharp turnover into alpha \simeq -1 at epsilon_ct \sim 100eV.
Relations of pulsed luminosity L_X to spin-down luminosity \edot are presented

fluxes of pulsed non-thermal X-ray emission of some objects, like the Crab or
the millisecond pulsar B1821-24, pose a challenge to the subclass of polar-cap

advantage of recent work that brought in some better understanding of the mass
function for gravitationally condensed objects. The physics of cooling of the

clusters from those that eventually form galaxies (possibly within the former
objects). With our new mass function and our new application of the cooling
criteria - which motivated this paper - we get a satisfactory and natural
cutoff at the bright end of the luminosity function, the needed flat slope for
faint magnitudes and the correct trend in colors (brighter galaxies are redder

earlier claims that the latter was inadequate to reproduce the former
observations. We find the velocity dispersion to be a much better parameter
than mass or radius to characterize galaxies. We find that bright galaxies form
at z~2 from mergers with a rather quiet evolution afterwards, whereas small
galaxies are the result of a continuous merging process active up to the

oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid before last scattering. For acceptable
values of the cosmological and baryon densities, the oscillations modulate the
power by up to 10%, with a `period' in spatial wavenumber which is close to
Delta k approximately 0.05/ Mpc. We study the effects of nonlinear evolution on
these features, and show that they are erased for k > 0.2 h/ Mpc. At larger
scales, the features evolve as expected from second-order perturbation theory:
the visibility of the oscillations is affected only weakly by nonlinear
evolution. No realistic CDM parameter combination is able to account for the
claimed feature near k = 0.1 h/ Mpc in the APM power spectrum, or the excess
power at 100 Mpc/h wavelengths quoted by several recent surveys. Thus baryonic
oscillations are not predicted to dominate existing measurements of clustering.
We examine several effects which may mask the features which are predicted, and
conclude that future galaxy surveys may be able to detect the oscillatory

their role in feedback and the consequences for disk assembly. Extending the
picture proposed by Dekel & Silk (1986), we argue that energetic supernovae
winds can expel baryons from all proto-galaxies with varying degrees of
efficiency. The fraction of baryons retained and hence available to assemble
into the baryonic disk is therefore, a function of the central velocity
dispersion of the halo. Such a coupling of the baryonic component to the dark
halo leads to the following interesting consequence, a prediction for a weak
scaling of the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation or alternatively, the
mass-to-light ratio with the central velocity dispersion of the halo. On
applying to the case of the Milky Way halo, this feedback mechanism implies:
(i) that the Milky Way halo lost approximately 10% of its original gas content;
(ii) a range in the inferred redshift of formation $z_f$, and the local baryon
fraction $f_b$ for the Milky Way that depends on the initial spin parameter of
the halo. We find that for a low spin halo - $z_f < 1$, $f_b \sim 2%$; for a
median spin halo - $z_f \sim 1 - 2.5$, $f_b \sim 5%$; and for a high spin halo
- $z_f \sim 4 - 8$, $f_b \sim 20%$. The observationally determined ages for the
oldest disk stars in the Milky Way seem to rule out a low value for the spin
parameter. Given the shape of the spin distribution of halos obtained in N-body
simulations, while a high value of the spin parameter is not very probable, it
is interesting to note that if this is indeed the case for the Milky Way halo,
then feedback processes can cause the local baryon fraction to differ
significantly from the universal value.

star to the accretion of a brown dwarf or planet in its interior. In
particular, we examine the case in which the brown dwarf spirals-in, and the
accreted matter is deposited at the base of the convective envelope and in the
thin radiative shell surrounding the hydrogen burning shell. In our spherically
symmetric simulations, we explore the effects of different accretion rates and
we follow two scenarios in which the amounts of injected mass are equal to
$\sim 0.01$ and $\sim 0.1 M_\odot$. The calculations show that for high
accretion rates ($\dot M_{acc} = 10^{-4} M_\odot yr^{-1}$), the considerable
release of accretion energy produces a substantial expansion of the star and
gives rise to hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope. For
somewhat lower accretion rates ($\dot M_{acc} = 10^{-5} M_\odot yr^{-1}$), the
accretion luminosity represents only a small fraction of the stellar
luminosity, and as a result of the increase in mass (and concomitantly of the
gravitational force), the star contracts. Our simulations also indicate that
the triggering of thermal pulses is delayed (accelerated) if mass is injected
at a slower (faster) rate. We analyze the effects of this accretion process on
the surface chemical abundances and show that chemical modifications are mainly
the result of deposition of fresh material rather than of active
nucleosynthesis. Finally, we suggest that the accretion of brown dwarfs and
planets can induce the ejection of shells around giant stars, increase their
surface lithium abundance and lead to significant spin-up. The combination of
these features is frequently observed among G and K giant stars.

since, while much effort has been invested in refining the predictions of
hierarchical CDM models, only very simplistic models have been used to study
the evolution of galaxies in other cosmogonies (e.g. isocurvature models). We
demonstrate that the use of a more realistic multi-zone chemo-dynamical
single-collapse model, yields colours at intermediate redshifts which are much
bluer than inferred from the one-zone model, and indeed are comparable to those
predicted by hierarchical merging despite still allowing $> 90%$ of the final
stellar mass of elliptical galaxies to be formed in the first Gyr of their
evolution. We, therefore, conclude that the one-zone model should be avoided to

their dismissal premature.

prominent break at the Lyman limit (i.e. a complete absence of flux at

distribution, excitation, reddening and kinematics. In NGC 2110, the emission
line ratio [FeII]/Pa beta increases towards the nucleus (to ~ 7). The nuclear
[Fe II]1.257 (microns) and Pa beta lines are broader (FWHM ~ 500 km/s) than the
H2 (2.121) line (FWHM ~ 300 km/s). Both these results suggest that shocks,
driven by the radio jet, are an important source of excitation of [Fe II]. The
H2 excitation appears to be dominated by X-rays from the nucleus. In Circinus,
both [FeII]/Pa beta and H2/Br gamma decrease from ~ 2 at 4 arcsec from the
nucleus to nuclear values of ~ 0.6 and ~ 1, respectively, suggesting that the
starburst dominates the nuclear excitation, while the AGN dominates the
excitation further out (r > 2 arcsec). For both galaxies, the gaseous
kinematics are consistent with circular rotation in the plane of the disk. Our
rotation curves suggest that the nucleus (identified with the peak of the IR
continuum) is displaced from the kinematic centre of the galaxies. This effect
has been observed previously in NGC 2110 based on the kinematics of optical
emission lines, but the displacement is smaller in the infrared, suggesting the
effect is related to obscuration. The continuum J-K colours of the nuclear
region indicate a red stellar population in NGC 2110 and a reddened young
stellar population in Circinus. Right at the nucleus of both galaxies, the
colours are redder, apparently a result of hot dust emission from the inner
edge of a circumnuclear torus.

is not possible to define a classical dynamics consistent with the full algebra

it is possible to determine the number of constraint that must be included in a

constraint conditions that must be introduced in the classical Lagrangian

resonant-level model by generalizing the bosonization-refermionization approach
of Emery and Kivelson to finite system size, but improve their method in two
ways: firstly, we construct all boson fields and Klein factors explicitly in
terms of the model's original fermion operators $c_{k \sigma j}$, and secondly
we clarify explicitly how the Klein factors needed when refermionizing act on
the original Fock space. This enables us to explicitly follow the adiabatic
evolution of the 2CK model's free-fermion states to its exact eigenstates,
found by simply diagonalizing the resonant-level model for arbitrary magnetic
fields and spin-flip coupling strengths. In this way we obtain an {\em
analytic} description of the cross-over from the free to the non-Fermi-liquid
fixed point. At the latter, it is remarkably simple to recover the conformal
field theory results for the finite-size spectrum (implying a direct proof of
Affleck and Ludwig's fusion hypothesis). By analyzing the finite-size spectrum,
we directly obtain the operator content of the 2CK fixed point and the
dimension of various relevant and irrelevant perturbations. Our method can
easily be generalized to include various symmetry-breaking perturbations.
Furthermore it establishes instructive connections between different
renormalization group schemes such as poor man's scaling, Anderson-Yuval type
scaling, the numerical renormalization group and finite-size scaling.

higher crossover temperature continuously connects to the spin gap at half
filling, and the susceptibilities are suppressed around this temperature. At
low temperatures, the susceptibilities increase again with decreasing
temperature when doping is finite. We confirm that they finally approach to the
values obtained in the Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid ground state for several
parameters. The crossover temperature to the TL liquid is a new energy scale
determined by gapless excitations of the TL liquid. The transition from the
metallic phase to the insulating phase is accompanied by the vanishing of the

imagining personal or vicarious experiences in the past or future. The
following important roles of daydreaming in human cognition are postulated:
plan preparation and rehearsal, learning from failures and successes, support
for processes of creativity, emotion regulation, and motivation.
  A computational theory of daydreaming and its implementation as the program
DAYDREAMER are presented. DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based
on relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the
scenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which
guide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which daydreams
initiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes,
and 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday
occurrences.
  The role of emotions and control goals in daydreaming is discussed. Four
control goals commonly used in guiding daydreaming are presented:
rationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role
of episodic memory in daydreaming is considered, including how daydreamed
information is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of
DAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running.

an integrated distributed operating system which provides a high degree of

mechanism allows a transaction to access objects directly without regard to the

transaction may be located at many sites. Thus there is no need to invoke a new
transaction to perform processing or access objects at a remote site. Third,
unlike other environments, LOCUS allows replication of data objects at more
than one site in the network, and this capability is incorporated into the
transaction mechanism. If the copy of an object that is currently being
accessed becomes unavailable, it is possible to continue work by using another
one of the replicated copies. Finally, an efficient orphan removal algorithm is

results known for the quantum Brownian motion, we consider a self-interacting

action by integrating out the field modes with wavelength shorter than a
critical value. From this effective action we obtain the evolution equation for
the reduced density matrix (master equation). We compute the diffusion
coefficients for this equation and analyze the decoherence induced on the

  figures and several references are added","Eur.Phys.J. A5 (1999) 293-306",,"DESY 98-197","hep-ph",,"  The QCD factorization theorem for diffractive processes in DIS is used to
derive formulae for the leading twist contribution to the nuclear shadowing of
parton distributions in the low thickness limit. Based on the current analyzes
of diffraction at HERA we find that the average strength of the interactions
which govern diffraction in the gluon sector at $x \le 10^{-3}, Q_0=2 GeV$ is
~50 mb. This is 3 times larger than in the quark sector and suggests that
applicability of DGLAP approximation requires significantly larger $Q_0$ in the
gluon sector. We use this information to estimate quark and gluon shadowing for
heavy nuclei and to calculate its$Q^2$ depen- dence. For A~200 the amount of
the gluon shadowing: $G_A/AG_N\sim 0.25-0.4$ at $x<10^{-3},Q=2GeV$ is sensitive
to the probability of the small size configurations within wave function of the
gluon ""partonometer"" at the $Q_0$ scale. At this scale for $A\sim 200$ the
nonperturbative contribution to the gluon density is reduced by a factor of 4-5
at $x \le 10^{-3}$ unmasking PQCD physics in the gluon distribution of heavy
nuclei. Such shadowing would strongly modify the first stage of the heavy ion
collisions at LHC, and would lead to large color opacity effects in $eA$
collisions at x<0.001. The leading twist contribution to the cross section of
the coherent $J/\psi$ production off $A\ge 12$ nuclei at $\sqrt s \ge 70$ GeV
is strongly reduced as compared to the naive color transparency expectations.
The Gribov black body limit for $F_{2A}(x,Q^2)$ is extended to the case of the
gluon distributions in nuclei and shown to be relevant for the HERA kinematics
of $eA$ collisions. Properties of the final states are also briefly discussed.

problem of the gauge hierarchy is that of understanding why some dimensions

problem, as usually formulated, is `why quantum corrections do not modify
drastically the masses and other parameters of the Standard Model'. We argue
that within type-I perturbation theory, the technical hierarchy problem is
solved (a) if all massless tadpoles cancel locally over distances of order the
string length in the transverse space, or (b) if the massless fields with
uncancelled local tadpoles propagate `effectively' in $d_\perp \ge 2$ large
transverse dimensions. These restrictions ensure that loop corrections to the
Standard Model parameters decouple from the four-dimensional Planck scale,
except when there are uncancelled tadpoles in $d_\perp =2$ in which case the
dependence on $M_P$ is logarithmic. This latter case is thus singled out as the
only one in which the origin of the hierarchy would not be attributed entirely
to `out of this world' bulk physics. The role of the renormalization group
equations in summing the leading large logs is replaced by the classical 2d
supergravity equations in the transverse space.

uncover the mapping of global symmetries of the corresponding pair of D-branes

under the unsteady, incompressible fluid motion on 3D region M are introduced.
The equivalence class up to exact one-forms of each potential one-form is
splitted by the velocity field. The components of this splitting corresponds to
Lagrangian and Eulerian conservation laws for helicity densities. These are
expressed as the closure of three-forms which depend on two discrete and a
continuous parameter. Each two-form is extended to a symplectic form on R X M.
The subclasses of potential one-forms giving rise to Eulerian helicity
conservations is shown to result in conformally symplectic structures on R X M.
The connection between Lagrangian and Eulerian conservation laws for helicity
is shown to be the same as the conformal equivalence of a Poisson bracket
algebra to infinitely many local Lie algebra of functions on R X M.

fragments was measured in different symmetric reactions at bombarding energies
from 90 to 800 AMeV. The flow parameter is found to increase with the charge of
the detected fragment up to Z = 3-4 and then turns into saturation for heavier
fragments. Guided by simple simulations of an anisotropic expanding thermal
source, we show that the value at saturation can provide a good estimate of the
flow angle, $\Theta_{flow}$, in the participant region. It is found that
$\Theta_{flow}$ depends strongly on the impact parameter. The excitation
function of $\Theta_{flow}$ reveals striking deviations from the ideal
hydrodynamical scaling. The data exhibit a steep rise of $\Theta_{\flow}$ to a
maximum at around 250-400 AMeV, followed by a moderate decrease as the
bombarding energy increases further.

relations for the 18 scalar and pseudoscalar meson species are derived and
their self-consistent solution makes it possible to trace out the thermal path
of the two order parameters as well as delineate the region of instability
within which spontaneous pair creation becomes possible. The results depend
significantly on the employed sigma mass, with the highest values yielding the
largest regions of instability. An approximate solution of the equations of
motion for the order parameter in scenarios emulating uniform scaling
expansions show that even with a rapid quench only the pionic modes grow
unstable. Nevertheless, the rapid and oscillatory relaxation of the order
parameters leads to enhanced production of both pions and (to a lesser degree)
kaons.

magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is presented. The simulations start from two
interlocking magnetic flux rings with no initial velocity. The magnetic
curvature force causes the flux rings to shrink until they come into contact.
This produces a current sheet between them. In the ideal compressible
calculations, the evidence for a singularity in a finite time $t_c$ is that the
peak current density behaves like $|J|_\infty \sim 1/(t_c-t)$ for a range of
sound speeds (or plasma betas). For the incompressible calculations consistency
with the compressible calculations is noted and evidence is presented that
there is convergence to a self-similar state. In the resistive reconnection
calculations the magnetic helicity is nearly conserved and energy is
dissipated.
