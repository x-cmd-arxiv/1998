independent spectroscopy, crossed the central isolated cusp of the lensing
binary, generating a sharp peak in the light curve that was well-resolved by
dense (3 - 30 minute) and continuous monitoring from PLANET sites in Chile,
South Africa, and Australia. Our modeling of these data has produced stellar
profiles for the source star in the I and V bands that are in excellent
agreement with those predicted by stellar atmospheric models for K giants. The
limb-darkening coefficients presented here are the first derived from
microlensing, among the first for normal giants by any technique, and the first
for any star as distant as the Galactic bulge. Modeling indicates that the
lensing binary has a mass ratio q = 0.23 and an (instantaneous) separation in
units of the angular Einstein ring radius of d = 0.69 . For a lens in the
Galactic bulge, this corresponds to a typical stellar binary with a projected
separation between 1 and 2 AU. If the lens lies closer, the separation is
smaller, and one or both of the lens objects is in the brown dwarf regime.
Assuming that the source is a bulge K2 giant at 8 kpc, the relative lens-source
proper motion is mu = 19.4 +/- 2.6 km/s /kpc, consistent with a disk or bulge
lens. If the non-lensed blended light is due to a single star, it is likely to
be a young white dwarf in the bulge, consistent with the blended light coming
from the lens itself.

matter fluctuations using the non-linear shear-free dynamics, an approximation
which reproduces well the results of perturbation theory for the cumulants in
the linear and weakly non-linear clustering regime. As high matter
overdensities tend to saturate in spectra, the statistics of the flux
distribution are dominated by weakly non-linear overdensities. As a result, our
analytic approach can produce accurate predictions, when tested against N-body
simulation results, even when the underlying matter field has rms fluctuations
larger than unity. Our treatment can be applied to either Gaussian or
non-Gaussian initial conditions. Here we concentrate on the former case, but
also include a study of a specific non-Gaussian model. We discuss how the
methods and predictions we present can be used as a tool to study the generic

generalise these results for discs with strong warps and arbitrary surface
density profiles, and calculate the timescale on which the black hole becomes
aligned with the angular momentum in the outer disc. For massive holes and
accretion rates of the order of the Eddington limit the alignment timescale is
always short (less than a Myr), so that jets accelerated from the inner disc

the disc. Longer timescales are predicted for low luminosity systems, depending
on the degree of anisotropy in the disc's hydrodynamic response to shear and
warp, and for the final decay of modest warps at large radii in the disc that
are potentially observable via VLBI. We discuss the implications of this for

which the efficiency of galaxy formation is determined by density, geometry, or
velocity dispersion of the local mass distribution, with that of non-local
biasing models, in which galaxy formation is modulated coherently over scales
larger than the galaxy correlation length. If morphological segregation of
galaxies is governed by a local MD relation, then the correlation function of
E/S0 galaxies should be steeper and stronger than that of spiral galaxies on
small scales, as observed, while on large scales the correlation functions of
E/S0 and spiral galaxies should have the same shape but different amplitudes.
Similarly, all of our local bias models produce scale-independent amplification
of the correlation function and power spectrum in the linear and mildly
non-linear regimes; only a non-local biasing mechanism can alter the shape of
the power spectrum on large scales. Moments of the biased galaxy distribution
retain the hierarchical pattern of the mass moments, but biasing alters the
values and scale-dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes S3 and S4.
Pair-weighted moments of the galaxy velocity distribution are sensitive to the
details of the biasing prescription. The non-linearity of the relation between
galaxy density and mass density depends on the biasing prescription and the
smoothing scale, and the scatter in this relation is a useful diagnostic of the
physical parameters that determine the bias. Although the sensitivity of galaxy
clustering statistics to the details of biasing is an obstacle to testing
cosmological models, it is an asset for testing galaxy formation theories.

Interestingly, this is similar to the free-fall velocity that the two Cygnus A
subclusters should have achieved at the observed separation, suggesting that
merger has been effective in dissipating the kinetic energy of gas halos into
thermal energy, without channeling its major fraction elsewhere (e.g., into
turbulence). In A3667, we may be observing a spatial lag between the shock
front seen in the X-ray image and the corresponding rise of the electron

the combination of thermal conduction and a finite electron-ion equilibration
time. Forthcoming better spatial resolution data will allow a direct
measurement of these phenomena using such lags. A2065 has gas density peaks
coincident with two central galaxies. A merger with the collision velocity

subcluster total mass distributions had flat cores in the centers. The fact
that the peaks have survived (or quickly reemerged) suggests that the
gravitational potential also is strongly peaked. Finally, the observed specific
entropy variations in A3667 and Cygnus A indicate that energy injection from a
single major merger may be of the order of the full thermal energy of the gas.
We hope that these order of magnitude estimates will encourage further work on
hydrodynamic simulations, as well as more quantitative representation of the
simulation results.

find that physical collisions between stars in these models are frequent, and
that the evolution of the most massive stars and the dynamical evolution of the
cluster are closely coupled. In all cases, a single star grows steadily in mass
through mergers with other stars, forming a very massive (>100 Msun) star in
less than 3-4 Myr. The growth rate of this runaway merger is much larger than
estimates based on simple cross-section arguments, mainly because the star is
typically found in the core and tends to form binaries with other massive stars
there. The runaway is ``rejuvenated'' by each new collision, and its lifetime
is extended considerably as a consequence. Observationally, such a star will
appear in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as a blue straggler. When the runaway
forms a black hole, the binary in which it is found is usually dissociated.

(CfA) Redshift Surveys. We study the properties of galaxy groups and clusters
identified using standard observational techniques and we study the relation of
these groups to real virialised systems. Most features of CfA2N groups are
reproduced quite well by both models with no obvious dependence on Omega_0.
Redshift space correlations and pairwise velocities are also similar in the two
cosmologies. The luminosity functions predicted by our galaxy formation models
depend sensitively on the treatment of star formation and feedback. For the
particular choices of Paper I they agree poorly with the CfA survey. To isolate
the effect of this discrepancy on our mock redshift surveys, we modify galaxy
luminosities in our simulations to reproduce the CfA luminosity function
exactly. This adjustment improves agreement with the observed abundance of
groups, which depends primarily on the galaxy luminosity density, but other
statistics, connected more closely with the underlying mass distribution,
remain unaffected. Regardless of the luminosity function adopted, modest
differences with observation remain. These can be attributed to the presence of
the ``Great Wall'' in the CfA2N. It is unclear whether the greater coherence of
the real structure is a result of cosmic variance, given the relatively small

swing amplifier criteria are applied to set a range in the mass-to-light ratio

a number of bright spirals the rotation curve drops just outside the optical

formation of some bars, asymmetries and grand design spirals. Bound clumps can
form in the tails, due to self-gravity, and could evolve to dwarf galaxies.
Off-centerings and asymmetries in the central parts of barred galaxies can be
made by off-centered and/or oblique impacts of sufficiently massive and compact
companions. Similar impacts, but preferably centered, on non-barred galaxies
can form ring galaxies. Companions on initially near-circular orbits can also
cause changes to the target disc as they spiral gradually inwards. Low density
companions are disrupted before reaching the center of the target and their
debris form a thick disc. On the other hand most of the mass of the high
density companions reaches the center, where it may form a bulge, thus
entailing evolution along the Hubble sequence. Such companions thicken and
expand the target disc and may also destroy bars in it. If their initial
orbital plane is at an angle to the plane of the disc of the target, they can
cause the latter to tilt substantially, depending on their mass and initial
inclination.

a result of inadequate evaluation of the stellar population.

characterized by ``twisting isophotes'' and consider the potential for
observability of this effect. In the Milky Way, a typical globular cluster must
pass within several hundred pc of the center to experience substantial
distortion, and it is possible that this has happened recently to one or two
present day clusters. We estimate that this distortion could be observed even
for globulars in dense fields toward the bulge. In more extreme environments
such as giant ellipticals or merger products with newly formed globulars, this
effect could be more common, extending out to orbits that pass within 1 kpc of

that quite generally, the Landau theory for this system can be recast as a
zero-mean problem in the presence of a magnetic field. Naturally then, we find
that a Gabay-Toulouse line exists for $M>1$ when the distribution of exchange

presented in the vicinity of the bi-critical point characterized by the
intersection of the ferromagnetic (M=1) or superconducting (M=2) phase with the

number of examples is too small to properly estimate the coefficients of the
nonlinear part. When trained on simple rules, we find that SVMs overfit only
weakly. The performance of SVMs is strongly enhanced, when the distribution of
the inputs has a gap in feature space.

by random magnetic interaction and/or by spin glass proximity are found. The
existence of low-energy excitations, arising from replica permutation symmetry
breaking (RPSB) in the Quantum Parisi Phase, is shown to be relevant for the

presented together with a few results for infinity-step breaking. Suppression
of reentrant SG - SC - SG transitions due to RPSB is found and discussed in

SG phases presents a theoretical landmark for comparison with experiments in
heavy fermion systems and high T_c superconductors. We find a crossover line
traversing the SG-phase with (\mu=0,T=0) as its quantum critical (end)point in

Fokker, Dirac and others to ultimately culminate in the Feynman- Wheeler direct
action at a distance theory. However this theory has encountered certain
conceptual difficulties like non-locality in time, self force of the electron,
pre acceleration and the perfect absorption condition of Feynman and Wheeler,
that is the instantaneous action of the remaining charges in the universe on
the charge in question. More recently, Hoyle and Narlikar have resurrected this
theory, but within the context of a Steady State or Quasi Steady State
cosmology. They argue that the theory infact has a better standing than the
generally accepted quantum theoretic description. In this article we consider a
quantum theoretic description and a cosmology which parallels the
Hoyle-Narlikar approach. This leads to a synthesis and justification of the
Dirac and Feynman-Wheeler approaches, clarifying the conceptual problems in the
process. We deduce a scenario with quantized space-time and a holistic
cosmology, consistent with physical and astrophysical data. The non-locality is
now seen to be meaningful within the minimum space-time intervals, as also the
perfect absorption within the holistic description. Local realism, and the
usual causal field theory are seen to have an underpinning of direct action.
For example this is brought out by the virtual photons which mediate
interactions in Quantum Electro Dynamics, and the emergence of the inverse
square law in the above approach from a background Zero Point Field.

starting point for the construction is the general diagrammatic representation
of the two-loop quark self-energy in terms of renormalized one-loop two- and
three-point function and tree level Bethe-Salpeter-type quark-gluon scattering
kernel insertions in the one-loop quark self-energy. Using factors of
longitudinal gluon four-momentum only from lowest order gauge field propagators
and triple gauge vertices to trigger the relevant Ward identities, the function
-i\hat\Sigma^(2)(p) is explicitly constructed from the consideration of the
two-loop QCD corrections to the Compton scattering of a photon off a quark. It
is shown that the resulting pinch technique self-energy -i\hat\Sigma^(2)(p) is
gauge-independent at all momenta, does not shift the position of the propagator
pole and is multiplicatively renormalizable by local counterterms. The
demonstration of the gauge independence is based on an efficient diagrammatic
method to deal with the several dozen two-loop diagrams involved. It is
explicitly shown by this example that the general correspondence between the
pinch technique n-point functions and those obtained in the background field
method in the Feynman quantum gauge \xi_{Q} = 1 does not persist beyond one

employ is somewhat analogous to anomaly analyses in grand unified models where
the anomaly cancellation becomes more transparent if one embeds SU(5)
multiplets into a multiplet of (anomaly-free) SO(10). A complication arises in
the treatment of $U^{AF}_{R}(1)^{3}$ matching where $U^{AF}_{R}(1)$ is
anomaly-free $R$ symmetry. It is noted that a relatively systematic analysis of
the anomaly matching is possible if one considers the formal breaking sequence

(i.e. give separable density matrices on tracing any party) if and only if they
have a generalized Schmidt decomposition. Implications of this result for the
quantification of multipartite pure-state entanglement are discussed. Further,
as an application of the techniques used here, we show that any purification of
a bipartite PPT bound entangled state is tri-inseparable, i.e. has none of its
three bipartite partial traces separable.

"quant-ph/9811092","Lev Vaidman","L. Vaidman","Defending Time-Symmetrized Quantum Counterfactuals","22 pages",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Recently, several authors have criticized the time-symmetrized quantum theory
originated by the work of Aharonov et al. (1964). The core of this criticism
was a proof, appearing in various forms, which showed that the counterfactual
interpretation of time-symmetrized quantum theory cannot be reconciled with
standard quantum theory. I, (Vaidman, 1996a, 1997) have argued that the
apparent contradiction is due to a logical error and introduced consistent
time-symmetrized quantum counterfactuals. Here I repeat my arguments defending
the time-symmetrized quantum theory and reply to the criticism of these
arguments by Kastner (1999).

two-level atom embedded into a ``linear crystal'' of other two-level atoms.
These additional atoms play a role of a material media. All atoms interact with
a multimode cavity field. We study how the decay of the initially excited atom
is affected by the presence of material media and spectral properties of the
cavity field.
