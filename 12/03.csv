  Acta Astronomica, 48, 667, several errors corrected",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A toy model of a disk undergoing steady state accretion onto a black hole is
presented. The disk is in a hydrostatic equilibrium for all radii r > r_{in},
with the inner disk radius located between the marginally stable and marginally
bound orbits: r_{ms} > r_{in} > r_{mb}. Matter flows from the disk through a
narrow cusp at r_{ms} and falls freely into the black hole, carrying with it no
thermal energy. At radii larger than r_{out} the disk is assumed to radiate
away all locally generated heat, and therefore the disk is geometrically thin
for r > r_{out}. We assume that no heat generated in the inner disk, with
r_{out} > r > r_{in} can be radiated away, i.e. the disk is 100% advective, and
it becomes geometrically thick in this range of radii. All enthalpy of the
thick disk is used up to press the inner disk radius towards the marginally
bound orbit, and to lower the efficiency of conversion of accreted mass into
radiation generated only for r > r_{out}, by assumption.
  Conservation laws of mass, angular momentum and energy make it possible to
calculate the inner thick disk radius r_{in} for any specified value of its
outer radius r_{out}. As the nature of disk viscosity is not known there is
some freedom in choosing the shape of the thick disk, subject to several
general conditions, which include the hydrostatic equilibrium everywhere for r
> r_{in}. The main purpose of this toy model is to emphasize the effect the
disk thickness has on lowering the energetic efficiency of a black hole
accretion.

(PDRs). We draw attention to an apparent confusion in the literature between
the ortho-to-para ratio of molecules in FUV-pumped vibrationally excited
states, and the H2 ortho-to-para abundance ratio. These ratios are not the same
because the process of FUV-pumping of fluorescent H2 emission in PDRs occurs
via optically thick absorption lines. Thus, gas with an equilibrium ratio of
ortho- to para-H2 equal to 3 will yield FUV-pumped vibrationally excited
ortho-to-para ratios smaller than 3, because the ortho-H2 pumping rates are
preferentially reduced by optical depth effects. Indeed, if the ortho and para
pumping lines are on the ``square root'' part of the curve-of-growth, then the
expected ratio of ortho and para vibrational line strengths is the square root
of 3, ~ 1.7, close to the typically observed value. Thus, contrary to what has
sometimes been stated in the literature, most previous measurements of the
ratio of ortho- to para-H2 in vibrationally excited states are entirely
consistent with a total ortho-to-para ratio of 3, the equilibrium value for
temperatures greater than 200 K. We present an analysis and several detailed
models which illustrate the relationship between the total ratios of ortho- to
para-H2 and the vibrationally excited ortho-to-para ratios in PDRs. Recent
Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) measurements of pure rotational and
vibrational H2 emissions from the PDR in the star-forming region S140 provide
strong observational support for our conclusions.

been invoked to explain gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernovae, and a number of
problematic neutron star populations and specific binary systems. The ejecta
from this collapse has also been claimed as a source of r-process
nucleosynthesis. So far, most AIC studies have focussed on determining the
event rates from binary evolution models and less attention has been directed
toward understanding the collapse itself. However, the collapse of a white
dwarf into a neutron star is followed by the ejection of rare neutron-rich
isotopes. The observed abundance of these chemical elements may set a more
reliable limit on the rate at which AICs have taken place over the history of
the galaxy.
  In this paper, we present a thorough study of the collapse of a massive white
dwarf in 1- and 2-dimensions and determine the amount and composition of the
ejected material. We discuss the importance of the input physics (equation of
state, neutrino transport, rotation) in determining these quantities. These
simulations affirm that AICs are too baryon rich to produce gamm-ray bursts and
do not eject enough nickel to explain Type Ia supernovae (with the possible
exception of a small subclass of extremely low-luminosity Type Ias). Although
nucleosynthesis constraints limit the number of neutron stars formed via AICs
to <0.1% of the total galactic neutron star population, AICs remain a viable
scenario for forming systems of neutron stars which are difficult to explain

considered. One of our main interests in this work has been to study the
evolution of ZZ Ceti models, with the aim of comparing the CGM and mixing
length theory (MLT) predictions. In this connection, we find that the
temperature profile given by the CGM model is markedly different from that of
the ML1 and ML2 versions of MLT. We have also computed approximate effective
temperatures for the theoretical blue edge of the DA instability strip by using
thermal timescale arguments for our evolving models. In this context, we found
that the CGM theory leads to blue edges that are cooler than the observed ones.

stars is dependent on the assumed convection description in model atmosphere
calculation, observed blue edges computed considering the CGM theory are
required in order to perform a sef consistent comparison of our results with

simulate the direct neutrino driven mass loss, and, the shock is not launched

populate many Landau levels. The magnetic field keeps the process operative if
Delta k / k_{Fn} < N_{Fp}^{-2/3} (N_{Fp} is the number of the Landau levels

well-known switch-on limit in the absence of the field, Delta k < 0. Cooling of
magnetized neutron stars with strong neutron superfluid in the outer cores and
nonsuperfluid inner cores is simulated. The magnetic field near the stellar
center speeds up the cooling if the stellar mass M is slightly less than the
minimum mass M_c at which the direct Urca reaction becomes allowed for B=0. If
B=3x10^{16} G the affected mass range is M_c-M < 0.1M_c, while for B=3x10^{15}

equations of fluid dynamics are derived in a coordinate system that follows the
principal warping motion of the disc. They are reduced using asymptotic methods
for thin discs, and solved to extract the equation governing the warp. In
general, this is a wave equation of parabolic type with non-linear dispersion
and diffusion, which describes fully non-linear bending waves. This method
generalizes the linear theory of Papaloizou & Pringle (1983) to allow for an

  D. Egret et al., 1998",,,"astro-ph",,"  More than two hundred classical cepheids were measured by the Hipparcos
astrometric satellite, making possible a geometrical calibration of the cepheid
distance scale. However, the large average distance of even the nearest
cepheids measured by Hipparcos implies trigonometric parallaxes of at most a
few mas. Determining unbiased distances and absolute magnitudes from such high
relative error parallax data is not a trivial problem.In 1997, Feast &
Catchpole announced that Hipparcos cepheid parallaxes indicated a
Period-Luminosity scale 0.2 mag brighter than previous calibrations, with
important consequences on the whole cosmic distance scale. In the wake of this
initial study, several authors have reconsidered the question, and favour
fainter calibrations of cepheid luminositites, compatible with pre-Hipparcos
values. All authors used equivalent data sets, and the bulk of the difference
in the results arises from the statistical treatment of the parallax data. We
have attempted to repeat the analyses of all these studies and test them with
Monte Carlo simulations and synthetic samples. We conclude that the initial
Feast & Catchpole study is sound, and that the subsequent studies are subjected
in several different ways to biases involved in the treatment of high relative
error parallax data. We consider the source of these biases in some detail. We
also propose a reappraisal of the error budget in the final Hipparcos cepheid
result, leading to a PL relation -- adapted from Feast & Catchpole -- of
M_V=-2.81 (assumed) log P -1.43 +-0.16 (stat) +0-0.03 (syst). We compare this
calibration to recent values from cluster cepheids or the surface brightness
method, and find that the overall agreement is good within the uncertainties.

the existence of a phase transition for strong coupling (i.e. at low

quantum field theories in a singular limit, the double scaling limit.It is
motivated by the fact that summing up dynamically triangulated random surfaces
using Feynman graphs of the O(N) matrix model results in a genus expansion and
it provides,in some sense, a nonperturbative treatment of string theory when
the double scaling limit is enforced. The main point emphasized here is that
this formal singular limit, recently discussed mainly in d=0 O(N) matrix
models, has an intriguing physical meaning in d>2 O(N) vector theories. In this
limit all orders in {1\over N} are of equal importance since at each order
infrared divergences compensate for the decrease in powers of {1\over N}. The
infrared divergences are due to the tuning of the strength of the force {g \to
g_c} between the O(N) quanta so that a massless O(N) singlet appears in the
spectrum. At the critical dimension an interesting phase structure is revealed,
the massless excitation has the expected physical meaning: it is the Goldston
boson of spontaneous breaking of scale invariance - the dilaton.

studied: (i) the representation of the wave functions in terms of the
exponential of Lassalle operators, (ii) the $sL(2,\rr)$ structure of the
Calogero--Moser wave functions.

the set of negative harmonic oscillators. Two time-independent canonical
transformations relating both models are constructed: one based on the recent
results concerning quantum Calogero model and one obtained from dynamical
$sL(2,\rr)$ algebra. The two-particle case is discussed in some detail.
