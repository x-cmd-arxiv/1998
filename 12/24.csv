J1755-32, and EXO~1846-031 X-ray sources are successfully fitted by the BMC
model, which has been derived from basic physical principles in previous work.
This in turn provides direct physical insight into the innermost observable
regions where matter impinging upon the event horizon can effectively be
directly viewed. The BMC model is characterized by three parameters: the disk
color temperature, a geometric factor related to the illumination of the black
hole (BH) site by the disk and a spectral index related to the efficiency of
the bulk motion upscattering. For the case of GRO J1655-40, where there are
distance and mass determinations, a self consistency check of the BMC model has
been made. Using model parameters we present new, independent constraints on
the black hole mass, mass accretion rate and the distance for the
aforementioned sources. Notable is the relationship between the color
temperature and flux, which for GRO J1655-40 is entirely distinct from a simple
T^4 dependence, and consistent with the disk model we have invoked - standard
Shakura-Sunyaev's disk. This allows us to impose an important estimation of the
hardness parameter, the ratio of the color temperature to the effective
temperature - we find T_h~2.6, higher than previous estimates used in the
literature.

evolution from low-mass dwarf irregulars (dIrrs) to dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(dSph) in the LG.
  Star formation histories for LG dwarfs and nearby LG candidates are compiled
using population boxes. No two dwarfs, irrespective of morphological type, show
the same evolutionary history, and all vary widely in ages of their
subpopulations and in their enrichment history. The lack of gas in dSphs and
dEs may be explained by a new photoionization scenario. Old populations, often
spatially very extended, may be a common property of dwarf galaxies, though
their fractions can be very small. Almost all types of dwarf galaxies studied
in detail so far show spatial variations in ages and abundances such as radial
age/metallicity gradients. The observed star formation histories impose
constraints on merger and accretion scenarios.
  Properties of the Milky Way dSphs are compared to the M31 dSphs and discussed
in the framework of the ram pressure/tidal stripping scenario. It is
demonstrated that the newly discovered LG dwarfs follow the same relationship
for central surface brightness, mean metallicity, and absolute magnitude as the
other LG dwarfs. (Shortened)

solidification front is destabilized on a scale much larger than the lamellar
spacing by the rejection of a dilute ternary impurity and forms two-phase cells
commonly referred to as `eutectic colonies'. We extend the stability analysis
of Datye and Langer for a binary eutectic to include the effect of a ternary
impurity. We find that the expressions for the critical onset velocity and
morphological instability wavelength are analogous to those for the classic
Mullins-Sekerka instability of a monophase planar interface, albeit with an
effective surface tension that depends on the geometry of the lamellar
interface and, non-trivially, on interlamellar diffusion. A qualitatively new
aspect of this instability is the occurence of oscillatory modes due to the
interplay between the destabilizing effect of the ternary impurity and the
dynamical feedback of the local change in lamellar spacing on the front motion.
In a transient regime, these modes lead to the formation of large scale
oscillatory microstructures for which there is recent experimental evidence in
a transparent organic system. Moreover, it is shown that the eutectic front
dynamics on a scale larger than the lamellar spacing can be formulated as an
effective monophase interface free boundary problem with a modified
Gibbs-Thomson condition that is coupled to a slow evolution equation for the
lamellar spacing. This formulation provides additional physical insights into
the nature of the instability and a simple means to calculate an approximate
stability spectrum. Finally, we investigate the influence of the ternary
impurity on a short wavelength oscillatory instability that is already present
at off-eutectic compositions in binary eutectics.

broken in the bulk by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and transmitted to the

to the pure Standard Model and electroweak symmetry is radiatively broken with

effective gluon correlator models the interaction between quark currents.
Functional integral calculus allows the GCM to be hadronised (i.e. expressed in
terms of meson and baryon fields). The dominant configuration of the hadronic
functional integrals is revealed to be the constituent quark effect, and is
identical to one version of the truncated quark Dyson-Schwinger equations
(tDSE). However the GCM shows that hadronic physics requires processes that go
beyond the tDSE. In this review examples of meson and nucleon processes are
given. The GCM also plays a pivotal role in showing how QCD may be related to
many other hadronic models.

quark-lepton families nor on any ``vertical'' symmetry structure, unifying
quarks and leptons inside a family as in Grand Unified Theories. Together with
a hypothesis of maximal CP violation, the model leads to a completely
predictive ansatz for all the CKM matrix elements in terms of the quark masses.
