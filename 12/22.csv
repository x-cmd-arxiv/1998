  Rate of Disk Galaxies in Clusters of Galaxies","19 pages, 9 figures, to appear in ApJ",,"10.1086/307139","OU-TAP 90","astro-ph",,"  Using a simple model of molecular cloud evolution, we have quantitatively
estimated the change of star formation rate (SFR) of a disk galaxy falling
radially into the potential well of a cluster of galaxies. The SFR is affected
by the ram-pressure from the intracluster medium (ICM). As the galaxy
approaches the cluster center, the SFR increases to twice the initial value, at
most, in a cluster with high gas density and deep potential well, or with a
central pressure of $\sim 10^{-2} cm^{-3} keV$ because the ram-pressure
compresses the molecular gas of the galaxy. However, this increase does not
affect the color of the galaxy significantly. Further into the central region
of the cluster ($\lesssim 1$ Mpc from the center), the SFR of the disk
component drops rapidly due to the effect of ram-pressure stripping. This makes
the color of the galaxy redder and makes the disk dark. These effects may
explain the observed color, morphology distribution and evolution of galaxies
in high-redshift clusters. By contrast, in a cluster with low gas density and
shallow potential well, or the central pressure of $\sim 10^{-3} cm^{-3} keV$,
the SFR of a radially infalling galaxy changes less significantly, because
neither ram-pressure compression nor stripping is effective. Therefore, the
color of galaxies in poor clusters is as blue as that of field galaxies, if
other environmental effects such as galaxy-galaxy interaction are not
effective. The predictions of the model are compared with observations.

effects in clusters to constrain the cosmological parameters Omega and Lambda.
On each background galaxy, a cluster induces a convergence and a shear terms,
which depend on the cluster projected potential, and on the cosmological
parameters (Omega,Lambda), through the angular distance ratio D_{LS}/D_{OS}. To
disentangle the effects of these three quantities, we compare the relative
values of the ellipticities for each triplet of galaxies located at about the
same position in the lens plane, but having different color redshifts. The
simultaneous knowledge of the ellipticities and photometric redshifts enable to
build a purely geometrical estimator of (Omega,Lambda) which does not depend on
the lens potential.A calculation and comparison of each source of statistical
noise is performed. We also analyzed the systematics.Simulations lead to
encouraging constraints on the curvature of the Universe and can discriminate
an open from a flat Universe. The test can also provide constraints on Lambda.
By using 20 VLT nights to observe 100 clusters, we can reach
Lambda_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for \Omega+\Lambda=1, or Omega_{-0.25}^{+0.3} for
\Lambda=0. The method is even better adapted to a large program on the NGST.

neutrino sources with the present experimental upper limit on cosmic ray
protons and the extragalactic gamma ray background, employing a transport
calculation of energetic protons traversing cosmic photon backgrounds. We take
into account the effects of the photon spectral shape in the sources on the
photoproduction process, cosmological source evolution, the optical depth for
cosmic ray ejection, and discuss the possible effects of magnetic fields in the
vicinity of the sources. For photohadronic neutrino sources which are optically
thin to the emission of neutrons we find that the cosmic ray flux imposes a
stronger bound than the extragalactic gamma ray background in the energy range

We also determine the maximum contribution from the jets of active galactic

observations. This present upper limit is consistent with the jets of active
galactic nuclei producing the extragalactic gamma ray background hadronically,

close to, the clouds themselves. On the face of it, this seems an improbable
occurrence if the Galactic dark halo provides the bulk of the lensing
population, as suggested by standard analyses of the MACHO dataset towards the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use a binomial statistic to assess the prior
probability of observing $M$ non-halo binary caustic events given a total
sample of $N$ caustic binaries. We generalize for the case of multi-component
Galactic and Magellanic Cloud models the Bayesian likelihood method for
determining the lens mass and halo fraction from the observed timescales. We
introduce a new statistic, the ``outcome discriminator'', which measures the
consistency between the binary caustic data, prior expectation, and the MACHO
LMC dataset as a whole. If the clouds are not embedded in their own dark halos
of MACHOs, then the discovery of two non-halo caustic binary events out of two
($M = N = 2$) is inconsistent with expectation given the MACHO dataset.
Galactic models in which $M = 1$ is the likeliest outcome are also inconsistent
with the data, though models in which $M = 1$ has a reasonable prior
probability are not. We consider the possibilities that the Magellanic Clouds
are embedded in dark haloes of their own, or that the Galactic halo is
intrinsically deficient in the binary systems which produce caustic crossing
events. Either of these possibilities provide greater compatibility between
observation and prior expectation, though the idea of Magellanic haloes is
perhaps the more natural of the two and has support from kinematical studies.

differ; emission line galaxies tend to be more concentrated in the south region
where groups appear to be falling onto the main cluster, in agreement with the
hypothesis (presented in our previous paper) that this infall may create a
shock which can heat the X-ray emitting gas and also enhance star formation in
galaxies. Then, we analyze the luminosity function in the R band, which shows
the presence of a dip similar to that observed in other clusters at comparable
absolute magnitudes; this result is interpreted as due to comparable
distributions of spirals, ellipticals and dwarfs in these various clusters.
Finally, we present the dynamical analysis of the cluster using parametric and
non-parametric methods and compare the dynamical mass profiles obtained from

interesting questions pertaining to the thermal balance of collapsing molecular
protoclouds. In numerous astrophysical cases molecular cooling and heating
influence dynamical evolution of the medium. The existence of a significant
abundance of molecules can be crucial on the dynamical evolution of collapsing
objects. Because the cloud temperature increases with contraction, a cooling
mechanism can be important for the structure formation, by lowering pressure
opposing gravity, i.e. by allowing continued collapse of Jeans unstable
protoclouds. This is particularly true for the first generation of objects. It
has been suggested that a finite amount of molecules such as $H_2$, $HD$ and
$LiH$ can be formed immediately after the recombination of cosmological
hydrogen (Lepp and Shull 1984, Puy et al 1993). The cosmological fractional
abundance $HD/H_2$ is small. Nevertheless, the presence of a non-zero permanent
electric dipole moment makes $HD$ a potentially more important coolant than
$H_2$ at modest temperatures, although $HD$ is much less abundant than $H_2$.
Recently Puy and Signore (1997) showed that during the early stages of
gravitational collapse, for some collapsing masses, $HD$ molecules were the
main cooling agent when the collapsing protostructure had a temperature of
about 200 Kelvins. Thus, we analytically estimate the molecular cooling during
the collapse of protoclouds Then, the possibility of thermal instability during
the early phase of gravitational collapse is discussed.

approximation which are known to be characterized by the presence of an

identical but arbitrarily correlated noises we demonstrate that there exists a
critical temperature $T_0$ which separates two different dynamical regimes
depending on whether damage spreads or not in the asymptotic long-time limit.
This transition exists for generic noise correlations such that the zero damage
solution is stable at high-temperatures being minimal for maximal noise
correlations. Although this dynamical transition depends on the type of noise
correlations we show that the asymptotic damage has the good properties of an
dynamical order parameter such as: 1) Independence on the initial damage; 2)
Independence on the class of initial condition and 3) Stability of the
transition in the presence of asymmetric interactions which violate detailed
balance. For maximally correlated noises we suggest that damage spreading
occurs due to the presence of a divergent number of saddle points (as well as
meta-stable states) in the thermodynamic limit consequence of the ruggedness of
the free energy landscape which characterizes the glassy state. These results
are then compared to extensive numerical simulations of a mean-field glass
model (the Bernasconi model) with Monte Carlo heat-bath dynamics. The freedom
of choosing arbitrary noise correlations for Langevin dynamics makes damage
spreading a interesting tool to probe the ruggedness of the configurational

a ferromagnetic/paramagnetic transition in doped charge-transfer insulators
with strong electron-phonon coupling. The relative strength of the exchange and
electron-phonon interactions determines whether the transition is first or
second order. A giant drop in the number of current carriers during the
transition, which is a consequence of local bound pair (bipolaron) formation in
the paramagnetic phase, is extremely sensitive to an external magnetic field.
Below the critical temperature of the transition, $T_c$, the binding of the
polarons into immobile pairs competes with the ferromagnetic exchange between
polarons and the localized spins on Mn ions, which tends to align the polaron
moments and, therefore, breaks up those pairs. The number of carriers abruptly
increases below $T_c$ leading to a sudden drop in resistivity. We show that the
carrier density collapse describes the colossal magnetoresistance of doped
manganites close to the transition.
  Below $T_c$, transport occurs by polaronic tunneling, whereas at high
temperatures the transport is by hopping processes. The transition is
accompanied by a spike in the specific heat, as experimentally observed. The
gap feature in tunneling spectroscopy is related to the bipolaron binding
energy, which depends on the ion mass. This dependence explains the giant
isotope effect of the magnetization and resistivity upon substitution of
$^{16}$O by $^{18}$O. It is shown also that the localization of polaronic
carriers by disorder {\em cannot} explain the observed huge sensitivity of the
transport properties to the magnetic field in doped manganites.

three kind of modifications. Firstly, the energy flux fluctuates around its
average value with amplitudes and frequencies determined by those of the metric
fluctuations. Secondly, this average value receives two positive contributions

relation of representation equivalence between representations of the conformal
group describing the bulk AdS fields $\phi$ and the coupled boundary fields
$\phi_0$ and ${\cal O}$. We use two kinds of equivalences. The first kind is
equivalence between bulk fields and boundary fields and is established here.
The second kind is the equivalence between coupled boundary fields. Operators
realizing the first kind of equivalence for special cases were given by Witten
and others - here they are constructed in a more general setting from the
requirement that they are intertwining operators. The intertwining operators
realizing the second kind of equivalence are provided by the standard conformal
two-point functions. Using both equivalences we find that the bulk field has in
fact two boundary fields, namely, the coupled boundary fields. Thus, from the
viewpoint of the bulk-boundary correspondence the coupled fields are on an
equal footing. Our setting is more general since our bulk fields are described
by representations of the Euclidean conformal group $G=SO(d+1,1)$, induced from
representations $\tau$ of the maximal compact subgroup $SO(d+1)$ of $G$. From
these large reducible representations we can single out representations which
are equivalent to conformal boundary representations labelled by the conformal
weight and by arbitrary representations $\mu$ of the Euclidean Lorentz group
$M=SO(d)$, such that $\mu$ is contained in the restriction of $\tau$ to $M$.
Thus, our boundary-to-bulk operators can be compared with those in the
literature only when for a fixed $\mu$ we consider a 'minimal' representation
$\tau=\tau(\mu)$ containing $\mu$.

distortions play an essential role in the modification of the coherent cross
section, the uncertainty in our results due to the various choices of

largest uncertainty emerges from the ambiguity in extending the many
on-shell-equivalent representations of the elementary amplitude off the mass
shell. Indeed, relativistic impulse-approximation calculations that include the
same pionic distortions, the same nuclear-structure model, and two sets of
elementary amplitudes that are identical on-shell, lead to variations in the
magnitude of the coherent cross section by up to factors of five. Finally, we
address qualitatively the assumption of locality implicit in most

connection between strong warm El Nino winter events and high spring
precipitation in a band from Southern England eastwards into Asia. This
relationship is an extension of the connection mentioned by Kiladis and Diaz
(1989), and much stronger than the winter season teleconnection that has been
the subject of other studies. Linear correlation coefficients between DJF NINO3
indices and MAM precipitation are higher than r=0.3 for individual stations,
and as high as r=0.49 for an index of precipitation anomalies around 50N from
5W to 35E. The lagged correlation suggests that south-east Asian surface
temperature anomalies may act as intermediate variables.

any q in a large range. Our result places no restrictions on the superposition
to be transformed, generalizing the result implicit in Shor which applies only
to periodic superpositions. In addition, our proof easily generalizes to
multi-dimensional transforms for any constant number of dimensions.

  We present a quantum algorithm that in the black-box model performs a search
in an ordered list of N elements. Using 3/4 log N + O(1) queries, it achieves a
success probability of at least 1/2, whereas classically, log N - O(1) queries
are needed to obtain constant success probability. Moreover, our algorithm
employs the Haar transform and thus differs substantially from Grover's search
algorithm and from algorithms relying on the quantum Fourier transform.

circle of real states on the Bloch sphere and give a variety of explicit
optimal strategies. We also consider general real group-covariant sources for
which the group acts irreducibly on the subset of all real states and prove the
existence of a real group-covariant optimal strategy, extending a theorem of
Davies (E. B. Davies, IEEE. Inf. Theory {\bf IT-24}, 596 (1978)). Finally we
propose an optical scheme to implement our optimal strategies, enough simple to

These systems are linearizable by construction and thus, obviously, integrable.
We show that in the continuous case it is possible to eliminate all variables

is of the form of those singled-out by Painlev\'e in his quest for integrable
forms. In the discrete case, we extend previous results of ours showing that,
again by elimination of variables, the general projective system can be written
as a mapping for a single variable. We show that this mapping is a member of
the family of multilinear systems (which is not integrable in general). The
continuous limit of multilinear mappings is also discussed.
