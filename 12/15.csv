for starburst galaxies as a function of redshift. The models include a
semi-analytic formulation, based on the well quantified radio-to-far infrared
correlation for low redshift star forming galaxies, and an empirical
formulation, based on the observed spectrum of the starburst galaxies M82 and
Arp 220. We compare the models to the observed values of alpha(350/1.4) for
starburst galaxies at low and high redshift. We find reasonable agreement
between the models and the observations, and in particular, that an observed
spectral index of alpha(350/1.4) > +0.5 indicates that the target source is
likely to be at high redshift, z > 1. The evolution of alpha(350/1.4) with
redshift is mainly due to the very steep rise in the Raleigh-Jeans portion of
the thermal dust spectrum shifting into the 350 GHz band with increasing
redshift. We also discuss situations where this relationship could be violated.
We then apply our models to examine the putative identifications of submm
sources in the Hubble Deep Field, and conclude that the submm sources reported
by Hughes et al. are likely to be at high redshifts, z > 1.5.

observed simultaneously from two independent telescopes at lambda = 2.2microns,
allowing us to investigate this source with an angular resolution of approx
0.003 arc-seconds. We have detected a circumstellar dust envelope whose
brightness distribution can be approximately fitted by a gaussian with a FWHM
of approx 0.06 arc-seconds (approx 10^15 cm). We present and discuss the
reconstructed brightness profile, which shows an asymmetry in the radial dust
distribution. The derived dust grain temperature at the inner dust zone of
approx 1150 K is consistent with available model calculations. There is no
signature of the central star from our observations, providing a direct
confirmation that the circumstellar shell emission dominates over the
photospheric emission at 2.2microns as predicted by fits to the spectral energy
distribution. Further lunar occultation observations at different position
angles are essential to reconstruct the 2--D image of the dust shell around WR
112. The current series of lunar occultations of WR 112 will continue to the
end of 1999 and will be visible for all equatorial and southern latitude

emission-measure distribution is characterized by two temperature components at
log T of 6.8 and 7.4. The EUVE spectra have been compared with non-simultaneous
ASCA SIS spectra of HD 35850. The SIS spectrum shows the same temperature
distribution as the EUVE DEM analysis. However, the SIS spectral firs suggest
sub-solar abundances, 0.34 < Z < 0.81. Although some of the discrepancy may be
the result of incomplete X-ray line lists, we cannot explain the disagreement
between the EUVE line-to-continuum ratio and the ASCA-derived Fe abundance.
Given its youth (t ~ 100 Myr), its rapid rotation (v sin i ~ 50 km/s), and its
high X-ray activity (Lx ~ 1.5E+30 ergs/s), HD 35850 may represent an activity
extremum for single, main-sequence F-type stars. The variability and EM
distribution can be reconstructed using the continuous flaring model of Guedel

generalise the better-known $S_p$ parameters; the former are obtained from the
two-point probability distribution function of the density fluctuations while
the latter describe only the one-point distribution. If galaxy clustering
develops from Gaussian initial fluctuations and a small-angle approximation is
adopted, standard perturbative methods suggest a particular hierarchical
relationship of the $C_{pq}$ for projected clustering data, such as the APM
survey. We establish the usefulness of the two-point cumulants for describing
hierarchical clustering by comparing such calculations against available
measurements from projected catalogs, finding very good agreement. We extend
the idea of cumulant correlators to multi-point {\em generalised} cumulant
correlators (related to the higher-order correlation functions). We extend
previous studies in the highly nonlinear regime to express the generalised
cumulant correlators in terms of the underlying ``tree amplitudes'' of
hierarchical scaling models. Such considerations lead to a technique for
determining these hierarchical amplitudes, to arbitrary order, from galaxy
catalogs and numerical simulations. Knowledge of these amplitudes yields
important clues about the phenomenology of gravitational clustering. For
instance, we show that three-point cumulant correlator can be used to separate
the tree amplitudes up to sixth order. We also combine the particular
hierarchical {\em ansatz} of Bernardeau & Schaeffer (1992) with extended and
hyperextended perturbation theory to infer values of the tree amplitudes in the

hydrogen-burning stars of any mass above the hydrogen-burning limit, and of any

functions to the hydrogen-burning limit in several globular clusters. The
resulting mass functions do not provide any support for dominance by very
low-mass stars. This is consistent with field surveys for sub-stellar mass
brown dwarfs, which show such objects to be relatively rare. These results are
complemented by very deep HST luminosity functions in the Large Magellanic

particle by a cavity when the geometry is such that the classical dynamics is
chaotic. This picture is relevant to a variety of systems, ranging from atomic
nuclei to microwave cavities; the main application here is to electronic
transport through ballistic microstructures. The theory describes the regime in
which there are two distinct time scales, associated with a prompt and an
equilibrated response, and is cast in terms of the matrix of scattering
amplitudes S. The prompt response is related to the energy average of S which,
through ergodicity, is expressed as the average over an ensemble of systems. We
use an information-theoretic approach: the ensemble of S-matrices is determined
by (1) general physical features-- symmetry, causality, and ergodicity, (2) the
specific energy average of S, and (3) the notion of minimum information in the
ensemble. This ensemble, known as Poisson's kernel, is meant to describe those
situations in which any other information is irrelevant. Thus, one constructs
the one-energy statistical distribution of S using only information expressible
in terms of S itself without ever invoking the underlying Hamiltonian. This
formulation has a remarkable predictive power: from the distribution of S we
derive properties of the quantum conductance of cavities, including its
average, its fluctuations, and its full distribution in certain cases, both in
the absence and presence prompt response. We obtain good agreement with the
results of the numerical solution of the Schrodinger equation for cavities in
which either prompt response is absent or there are two widely separated time
scales. Good agreement with experimental data is obtained once temperature
smearing and dephasing effects are taken into account.

quartz. The algorithmic and computational avenue applied here represents a
significant departure from the usual finite element approach based on continuum
elastic theory. The approach is to use an atomistic simulation in regions of
significantly anharmonic forces and large surface area to volume ratios or
where internal friction due to defects is anticipated. Peripheral regions of
MEMS which are well-described by continuum elastic theory are simulated using
finite elements for efficiency. Thus, in central regions of the device, the
motion of millions of individual atoms is simulated, while the relatively large
peripheral regions are modeled with finite elements. The two techniques run
concurrently and mesh seamlessly, passing information back and forth. This
coupling of length scales gives a natural domain decomposition, so that the
code runs on multiprocessor workstations and supercomputers. We present novel
simulations of the vibrational behavior of micron-scale silicon and quartz

elastic theory as a function of size, and the failure of the continuum

very differently than its higher-dimensional counterparts. Coulomb interactions
strongly modify the properties away from those of a Fermi liquid, resulting in
a Luttinger liquid (LL) characterized by a power-law vanishing of the density
of states at the Fermi level. Experiments on one-dimensional semiconductor
wires and fractional quantum Hall conductors have been interpreted using this
picture, but questions remain about the connection between theory and
experiment. Recently, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have emerged as a
new type of 1D conductor that may exhibit LL behavior. Here we present
measurements of the conductance of individual ropes of such SWNTs as a function
of temperature and voltage. Power law behavior as a function of temperature or
bias voltage is observed: G~ T^a and dI/dV ~ V^a. Both the power-law functional
forms and the inferred exponents are in good agreement with theoretical
predictions for tunneling into a LL.

physics. The most important theoretical techniques are introduced and their
usefulness is demonstrated with the help of simple examples. A survey over
frequently used programs and packages is provided, discussing their abilities
and fields of applications. Subsequently, some powerful packages which have
already been applied to important physical problems are described in more
detail. The review closes with the discussion of a few typical applications for
the automated computation of Feynman diagrams, addressing current physical
questions like properties of the $Z$ and Higgs boson, four-loop corrections to
renormalization group functions and two-loop electroweak corrections.

$\alpha(s)$, at $s=M_{\rm Z}^2$, and to the anomalous magnetic moment of the

presented historically in three steps: (I), use of $\tau$ spectral functions in
addition to $e^+e^-$ cross sections, (II), extended use of perturbative QCD and
(III), application of QCD sum rule techniques. The most precise values obtained

and mean entropy of states on translationally invariant systems (classical
lattice, quantum lattice and quantum continuous). By taking the property of
strong subadditivity, which for quantum systems was proven rather late in the
historical development, as one of four primary axioms (the other three being
simply positivity, subadditivity and translational invariance) we are able to
obtain results, some new, some proved in a new way, which appear to complement
in an interesting way results proved around thirty years ago on limiting mean
entropy and related questions. In particular, we prove that as the sizes of
boxes in Z^n or R^n increase in the sense of set inclusion, (1) their mean
entropy decreases monotonically and (2) their entropy increases monotonically.
Our proof of (2) uses the notion of ""m-point correlation entropies"" which we
introduce and which generalize the notion of ""index of correlation"" (see e.g.
R. Horodecki, Phys. Lett. A 187 p145 1994). We mention a number of further
results and questions concerning monotonicity of mean entropy for more general

elliptic but becomes elliptic under certain conditions on the boundary

A248 (1998) 103","10.1016/S0375-9601(98)00702-6",,"quant-ph",,"  The problem of estimating a generic phase-shift experienced by a quantum
state is addressed for a generally degenerate phase shift operator. The optimal
positive operator-valued measure is derived along with the optimal input state.
Two relevant examples are analyzed: i) a multi-mode phase shift operator for
multipath interferometry; ii) the two mode heterodyne phase detection.

transformation, we formulate the solution of the initial value problem of the
corresponding linear heat type equation using the Feynman-Kac path integral
formalism. For illustration, we present the exact solution for the forcing term
of the form: $F(x,t)=\omega ^2x+f(t).$ We also present the initial value
problem solution for the case with a constant forcing term to compare with the
known result.
