  Astron.Astrophys",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present X-ray observations of the interacting pair of galaxies NGC 4410a/b
with the ROSAT HRI and PSPC. The ROSAT HRI images reveal a point-like source
corresponding to NGC 4410a and an X-ray halo, extending 10"" from the nucleus
toward the southeast. The halo emission accounts for ~1/3 (L_X=1.3x10^{41} erg
s^{-1} in the 0.1 - 2.4 keV ROSAT band) of the total X-ray emission detected
from NGC 4410a. The spectrum of the total X-ray emission from NGC 4410a can be
fitted at best with a two-component emission model, combining a Raymond-Smith
spectrum with T = 10^7 K and a power-law spectrum (Gamma = 2.2). The fraction
of the thermal component to the total flux within this model is 35%, supporting
the results of the HRI observation. The total unresolved X-ray luminosity
detected with the PSPC amounts to 4x10^{41} erg s^{-1} in the ROSAT PSPC band
(for D = 97 Mpc). A preferable explanation might be the interaction between the
two galaxies causing a circumnuclear starburst around the active nucleus in the
peculiar late type Sab galaxy NGC 4410a. As a cumulative effect of exploding
stars a superbubble forms a bipolar outflow from the galactic disk with an
expansion time of ~8 Myr. The central source injects mechanical energy at a
constant rate of a few times 10^{42} erg s^{-1} into the superbubble. A HST
WFPC2 image decovers that NGC 4410a is seen almost face-on so that only the
approaching outflow is visible. The HRI contours reveal an elongation of this
outflow indicative for a faint X-ray ridge below the detection limit (L_X <=
1.4x10^{39} erg s^{-1}) toward the neighbouring galaxy NGC 4410b caused by its
tidal interaction. NGC 4410b houses only a faint X-ray source (L_X <=
3.8x10{39} erg s^{-1}).

Universe. Due to gravitational instability the galaxy formation is a threshold
process: in low-density environments galaxies do not form and matter remains in
primordial form. We investigate the influence of the presence of void and
clustered populations to the power spectrum of matter and galaxies. The power
spectrum of galaxies is similar to the power spectrum of matter; the fraction
of total matter in the clustered population determines the difference between
amplitudes of fluctuations of matter and galaxies, i.e. the bias factor. To
determine the fraction of matter in voids and clustered population we perform
numerical simulations. The fraction of matter in galaxies at the present epoch
is found using a calibration through the sigma_8 parameter.

exists (due to Eastwood and Singer) which is invariant under conformal
rescalings of the metric, in agreement with the conformal symmetry of the
Maxwell equations. Thus, starting from the de Donder gauge, which is not
conformally invariant but is the gravitational counterpart of the Lorenz gauge,
one can consider, led by formal analogy, a new family of gauges in general
relativity, which involve fifth-order covariant derivatives of metric
perturbations. The admissibility of such gauges in the classical theory is
first proven in the cases of linearized theory about flat Euclidean space or
flat Minkowski space-time. In the former, the general solution of the equation
for the fulfillment of the gauge condition after infinitesimal diffeomorphisms
involves a 3-harmonic 1-form and an inverse Fourier transform. In the latter,
one needs instead the kernel of powers of the wave operator, and a contour
integral. The analysis is also used to put restrictions on the dimensionless
parameter occurring in the DeWitt supermetric, while the proof of admissibility
is generalized to a suitable class of curved Riemannian backgrounds.
Eventually, a non-local construction is obtained of the tensor field which
makes it possible to achieve conformal invariance of the above gauges.

time axis equally in the (+) and (-) directions, then time is symmetric by
Weyl's definition. In the Feynman-Stueckelberg Interpretation, antimatter is
identical to matter but moves backward in time. This paper argues this
interpretation is physically real, leading to the universe containing dark
matter with mass accumulations similar to ordinary matte. As time expands, in
both directions away from the origin, quantum uncertainty allows a brief,
decreasing leakage of mass between (+) and (-) universes. Matter leaking from
(-) to (+) time moves forward in time, producing preponderance of matter in (+)
time. Antimatter leakage from (+) time to (-) time in the same way produces
antimatter preponderance in the (-) time universe. The remaining opposite
partner particles left by the leakage, (antimatter and matter respectively)
proceeding outward in antitime and time respectively, after many annihilations
also increase the two preponderances in the two universes. The anti-universe
should be observable by gravitational lensing, predicting ""MACHOS"" of
approximately stellar mass, and multiple micro-lensing of quasars.
Non-existence of primordial antimatter of Z>1, and a large variation in the
quantities of dark matter associated with different individual galaxies are
predicted. A symmetry is provided for Nodland and Ralston's observed maximum
axis of rotation of polarization of galactic synchrotron radiation. A new
solution of the horizon problem at times close to the origin is indicated.
Collapse of the wave function and time's arrow are explained and non-locality
and instantaneity of quantum interaction required. Extension of the hypothesis
