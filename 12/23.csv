analysis of our survey of the distant Universe through lensing clusters, which
uses massive cluster lenses with well-constrained mass models to magnify the
background sky. This both increases the sensitivity and reduces the effects of
source confusion. Accurate lens models are used to correct the observed sub-mm
source counts. The associated uncertainties do not dominate the final errors.
We derive counts by two independent methods: a direct inversion of the observed
sources, corrected individually for lens amplification; and a Monte-Carlo
simulation of our observations using a parametric model for the background
counts, which is folded through the lens models and incompleteness estimates to
determine best-fitting values of the count parameters. Both methods agree well
and confirm the robustness of our analysis. Detections that are optically
identified with galaxies in the lensing clusters are removed prior to our
analysis, and the results are insensitive both to the details of the correction
and to the redshift distribution of the detections. We present 850-micron
counts between 0.5 and 8 mJy. The most accurate count is determined at 1 mJy:
7900 +- 3000 deg^-2, including both Poisson and systematic errors. These are
the deepest sub-mm counts published, and are not subject to source confusion
because the detected galaxies are separated and magnified by the lens. Down to
the 0.5-mJy limit, the resolved 850-micron background radiation intensity is
(0.5 +- 0.2) nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}, comparable to the current COBE estimate of the
background, and so the bulk of the 850-micron background radiation originated
in distant ultraluminous galaxies.

be explained by a systematically greater lensing magnification of hotter

magnification. This effect can confuse the interpretation of the properties of
distant ultraluminous galaxies that are lensed by intervening galaxies, but
offers a possible way to investigate the temperature distribution of dust in

Lac objects. They form part of the blazar class, which are radio-loud AGN whose
relativistic jets are aligned along our line of sight. Several critical
milestones have helped establish this picture, first proposed at the Pittsburgh
BL Lac meeting 20 years ago, most recently the EGRET and TeV detections of
beamed gamma-ray emission. The spectral energy distributions are double peaked
and follow a self-similar sequence in luminosity, which can be explained by
electron cooling on ambient photons. This simple paradigm has yet to be tested,
and further questions remain, notably about physical conditions in blazar jets
--- the kinetic power, magnetic energy density, acceleration time scales,
proton content, etc. --- and how this energy is transported in the innermost
regions. Some clues are available from multiwavelength monitoring campaigns
although better sampling over longer periods is clearly called for. Recent work
on the host galaxies of BL Lac objects supports their unification with
low-power, aligned FRI radio galaxies. Nature makes jets with a large range of
kinetic powers, but the relative number densities of low-luminosity (""blue"" BL
Lacs) or high-luminosity (""red"" BL Lacs and FSRQ) blazars --- is highly
uncertain. Since according to unified schemes blazars are representative of all
radio-loud AGN, their jet properties have broad implications. Future EUV/X-ray
observations will illuminate the circumnuclear structure, especially the hot,
highly ionized, high velocity gas on sub-parsec scales, which could play a role
in jet dynamics and could possibly affect the formation of FRI vs. FRII type
jets. The study of blazars may also help us eventually understand the
difference between radio-quiet and radio-loud AGN. [slightly abridged]

surprising, the separation of Miras from SRb/Lb variables is unexpected.
  We show that ``standard'' steady-state radiatively driven models provide
excellent fits to the color distribution of Miras of all chemical types.
However, these models are incapable of explaining the dust emission from O-rich
SRb/Lb stars. The models can be altered to fit the data by postulating
different optical properties for silicate grains, or by assuming that the dust
temperature at the inner envelope radius is significantly lower (300-400 K)
than typical condensation temperatures (800-1000 K), a possibility which is
also supported by the detailed characteristics of LRS data.
  The absence of hot dust for SRb/Lb stars can be interpreted as a recent
(order of 100 yr) decrease in the mass-loss rate. The distribution of O-rich
SRb/Lb stars in the 25-12 vs. K-12 color-color diagram shows that the mass-loss
rate probably resumes again, on similar time scales. It cannot be ruled out
that the mass-loss rate is changing periodically on such time scales, implying
that the stars might oscillate between the Mira and SRb/Lb phases during their
AGB evolution as proposed by Kerschbaum et al. (1996). Such a possibility
appears to be supported by numerous recent observations.

analysis in the time domain we show that the width of the pulses in GRBs time
histories remain remarkably constant throughout the classic GRB phase. Peaks at
the end of a burst have the same average duration to within a few percent as
the peaks at the start of the burst. For emission sites that lie on a
relativistically expanding shell, peaks should grow in duration because of
deceleration. We find no deceleration over at least 2/3 of the burst duration.
For emission sites that occupy a spread of angles on a shell, the curvature
should cause the later peaks to grow in duration. Since we see no such growth,
we can limit the total angular size of the shell to be substantially smaller
than \Gamma^{-1} where \Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor. This lack of temporal
evolution of the pulse width should be explained by any fireball shock

migrating discrete absorption components (DACs), responsible for the observed
variability in the UV resonance doublets, are modeled. It turns out that the
column density of a DAC first increases and subsequently decreases with time
when the component is approaching its asymptotic velocity. In some cases this
velocity systematically differs from event to event. The recurrence timescale
of DACs is derived for most targets, and consistent results are obtained for
different spectral lines. The DAC recurrence timescale is interpreted as an
integer fraction of the stellar rotation period. In some datasets the
variability in the blue edge of the P Cygni lines exhibits a longer period than
the DAC variability. This might be related to the systematic difference in
asymptotic velocity of successive DACs. The phase diagram for the O giant xi
Persei shows clear evidence for so-called ``phase bowing'', which is an
observational indication for the presence of curved wind structures like
corotating interaction regions. No other O stars in our sample convincingly
show phase bowing, but this could be simply due to the absence of periodic
signal and hence coherent phase behaviour at low wind velocities.

by M. Rauch and W. Sargent). We find that near the quasar HeII Lya absorption
is produced by discrete clouds, with no significant diffuse gas; this is
attributed to a HeII ""proximity effect"" in which the quasar fully ionizes He in
the diffuse intergalactic medium, but not the He in denser clouds. By two
different methods we calculate that the average HeII Lya opacity at z~3.15 is
tau >= 4.8. In the Dobrzycki-Bechtold void in the HI Lya forest near z=3.18,
the average HeII opacity tau=4.47^{+0.48}_{-0.33}. Such large opacities require
the presence of a diffuse gas component as well as a soft UV background
spectrum, whose softness parameter, defined as the ratio of the
photo-ionization rate in HI over the one in HeII,
S=Gamma^J_HI/Gamma^J_HeII~=800, indicating a significant stellar contribution.
At z=3.05, there is a distinct region of high HeII Lya transmission which most
likely arises in a region where helium is doubly ionized by a discrete local
source, quite possibly an AGN. At redshifts z<2.87, the HeII Lya opacity
detected by STIS, tau=1.88, is significantly lower than at z>3. Such a
reduction in opacity is consistent with Songaila's (1998) report that the
hardness of the UV background spectrum increases rapidly from z=3 to z=2.9.

Q0151+048B (qB). These two quasars have very similar redshifts z_em = 1.922,
1.937, respectively, and an angular separation of 3.27 arcsec. The spectrum of
qA contains a DLA at z_abs = 1.9342 (close to the emission redshift) which
shows an emission line in the trough, detected at 4 sigma. Our narrow-band
image confirms this detection and we find Ly-alpha emission from an extended
area covering 6x3 arcsec^2, corresponding to 25x12h^-2 kpc^2 (q0=0.5, H0 = 100h
km s^-1). The total Ly-alpha luminosity from the DLA is 1.2 x 10^43 h^-2 erg
s^-1, which is a factor of several higher than the Ly-alpha luminosity found
from other DLAs. The narrow-band image also indicates that qB is not covered by
the DLA. This fact, together with the large equivalent width of the emission
line from the Ly-alpha cloud, the large luminosity, and the 300 km s^-1
blueshift relative to the DLA, can plausibly be explained if qB is the sourceof
a Lyman-limit system. We also consider the relation between DLAs and
Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). If DLAs are gaseous disks surrounding LBGs, and if
the apparent brightnesses and impact parameters of the few identified DLAs are
representative of the brighter members of the population, then the luminosity
distribution of DLAs is nearly flat, and we would expect that some 70% of the

which, as also seen in UV data, is mostly confined to the emission lines. The
HeII 4686 changes by the largest amount, consistent with X-ray driven
photo-ionisation. The flaring part of the line profiles is broader than the
average, as expected if they are dominated by the inner disc. The HeII 4686
profile is especially remarkable in that its blue-shifted peak is 1400 km/s
from line centre compared to 700 km/s for the HeI lines (the red-shifted peak
is blended with HeI 4713). We deduce that HeII 4686 emission is confined to the
inner 1/4 of the disc. We suggest that the activity of the inner disc indicates
that accretion is significant (and unstable) there, in contrast to quiescent
dwarf novae, in support of models in which GP Com is in a (quasi-)steady-state
of low mass transfer rate. GP Com shows triple-peaked lines profiles which
consist of the usual double-peaked profiles from a disc plus a narrow component
at line centre. We find evidence for both radial velocity and flux variability
in this component, inconsistent with a nebula origin. The radial velocity
amplitude and its phase relative to the `S'-wave are consistent with an origin
on the accreting white dwarf, if the mass ratio, q = M2/M1, is of order 0.02,
as expected on evolutionary grounds. However this explanation is still not
satisfactory as the systemic velocity of the narrow component shows significant
variation from line to line, and we have no explanation for this.

in a gravitationally lensed starburst galaxy, strongly stimulated searches of
other systems, but these were harder than foreseen, and less than 10 other
systems have been discovered in CO emission. Redshifts range between 2 and 5,
the largest being BR1202-0725 at z=4.69. Most of these systems, if not all, are
gravitationally amplified objects. Some have been discovered first through
their dust emission, relatively easy to detect because of the negative
K-correction effect. The detection of all these systems could give an answer
about the debated question of the star-formation rate as a function of
redshift. The maximum of star-formation rate, found around z=2 from optical
studies, could shift to higher z if the most remote objects are hidden by dust.
  Absorption in front of quasars can also probe cold gas at high redshift,
taking advantage of very high spatial (milli arcsec) and spectral (30m/s)
resolutions. From the diffuse components, one can measure the cosmic black body

presented. In the presence of a bias voltage, the quasiparticle state at any
given instant of time is described as a superposition of that particular set of
phase-dependent Andreev bound states that belongs to the specific phase
difference present at this instant between the superconducting banks. The
treatment -- basically a form of adiabatic perturbation theory -- has a strong
formal similarity to the treatment of the k-space dynamics of an electron in a
periodic potential under perturbation by an external electric field,
sufficiently strong to cause transitions across the energy gaps between bands
(Zener tunneling). It is shown that the quasiparticle wave function retains its
phase information during analogous transitions between Andreev bands. The
experimental observation of Shapiro steps at one-half the canonical voltage
follows naturally from the model, along with some of the experimental
properties of these steps, especially their much weaker temperature dependence,
compared to the canonical steps.

quantum gravity, in which the standard model particles are localized on the

inflationary scenario is natural in the brane world picture. In the lowest
energy state, a number of branes sit on top of each other (or at an orientifold
plane), so the vacuum energy cancels out. In the cosmological setting, some of
the branes ""start out"" relatively displaced in the extra dimensions and the
resulting vacuum energy triggers the exponential growth of the 3 non-compact
dimensions. The number of e-foldings can be very large due to the very weak
brane-brane interaction at large distances. In the effective four-dimensional
field theory, the brane motion is described by a slowly rolling scalar field
with an extremely flat plateau potential. When branes approach each other to a
critical distance, the potential becomes steep and inflation ends rapidly. Then

It is based on a renormalization group equation for the low energy effective
Lagrangian and the decoupling theorem. As an application, the model independent
search for Abelian Z' boson in four-fermion processes is analyzed. The basic
one-loop renormalization group relation for the parameters of the effective
Lagrangian is derived which gives possibility to reduce the problem to the
scattering of the Standard Model particles in the ``external field''
substituting heavy virtual Z' state. From the set of derived relations it is
determined that the absolute value of the Z' coupling to the axial currents has
to be the same for all fermions and is strongly correlated to the Z' coupling
to the scalar fields. The corresponding dependences between the parameters of
the effective Lagrangians are derived.

color space, we observe a time delayed fragmentation after the collision

the explanation for this behavior. We point out that this effect could play a

the requirements of the electronics. The energy and time readout are performed
respectively with a 14-bit dynamic range and with a resolution of about 0.4 ns.
The trigger branch consists of a nanosecond-resolution calorimetric
time-of-flight for background rejection and an electron trigger based on analog
`sliding windows'. The on-line background rejection currently achieved is
o(10**6). The electron trigger allows a low energy trigger threshold to be set
at about 0.50 +/- 0.08 (RMS) GeV with an efficiency >99.9%. The energy and time
performance of the readout and trigger electronics is based on a
newly-developed low noise (sigma_noise ca. 0.4 MeV) wideband (f < 200 MHz)
preamplifier located at the output of the photomultipliers which are used for
the fibre light readout in the ca. 1 Tesla magnetic field of H1.

investigated with account for diffraction and decay of coherency by roughness

Andronov-Leontovich approach the losses do not vanish at zero gliding angle and
scale proportional to the first power of roughness amplitude for small gliding
angles. It was shown that for small correlation radius of roughness the
scattering decay of coherency can be made of the same order as absorption decay
of lower channeling modes to produce angular collimation of X-ray beams.
Estimates were given for optimum capillary length at different roughness
amplitudes for angular sensitivity of X-ray transmission and chenneling effects
that can be usefull for designing of detector systems.

monopole potential arisen out of embedding the Abelian monopole solution in the

under some symmetry operations consisting of an Abelian subgroup in the complex
rotational group SO(3.C). This symmetry results in a certain (A)-freedom in
choosing a discrete operator entering the complete set {H, j^{2}, j_{3}, N(A),
K} . The same complex number A represents a parameter of the wave functions
constructed. The generalized inversion-like operator N(A) implies its own
(A-dependent) de- finition for scalar and pseudoscalar, and further affords
some generalized N(A)-parity selection rules. It is shown that all different
sets of basis func- tions Psi(A) determine the same Hilbert space. In
particular, the functions Psi(A) decompose into linear combinations of
Psi(A=0). However, the bases con- sidered turn out to be nonorthogonal ones
when A is not real number; the latter correlates with the non-self-conjugacy
property of the operator N(A) at those A-s.
