object (a passing MACHO or a planet) along the line-of-sight of one or more
pulsar is a formidable gravitational tool to discover dark matter.We already
noted that the presence of a few negative PSRs period, possibly due to such a
Shapiro delay, is roughly consistent with independent estimates of MACHOs
observed by microlensing in our Galaxy. Here we update our study and suggest to
verify and to calibrate the Shapiro phase delay to observe on ecliptic main
known planetary and solar gravitational fields. Once the test is probed we
propose to use, in a collective way, a subsample of PSRs on the ecliptic plane
to monitor our solar system for discovering any heavy unknown object, either
dark Macho or planets. The importance of such unknown possible planetary
components and their eventual near encounter with Earth in the far past (or
future) should be not neglected : the same life evolution (or extinction) might
be marked by such a rare event.

pronounced poleward branch at higher latitudes. In order to clarify the origin

the mean poloidal magnetic field in the convective zone, including meridional
circulation, anisotropic diffusivity, turbulent pumping and density pumping.
For realistic values of the transport coefficients we find that diffusivity is
prevalent, and the latitudinal distribution of the field at the surface simply
reflects the conditions at the bottom of the convective zone. Pumping effects
concentrate the field to the bottom of the convective zone; a significant part
of this pumping occurs in a shallow subsurface layer, normally not resolved in
dynamo models. The phase delay of the surface poloidal field relative to the
bottom poloidal field is found to be small. These results support the double
dynamo wave models, may be compatible with some form of a mixed transport
scenario, and exclude the passive transport theory for the origin of the polar

4% of the cosmic C abundance is in grains with radii <= 10 Angstroms, we find
that the rate of accretion onto these grains is adequately fast to account for
the observed large depletions of elements like Ti, without invoking
unreasonably high rates of mass transfer between interstellar phases or low
grain destruction rates. If these grains are composed of arene rings, then only
a limited number of metal atoms can be locked up in them. The depletion would
be quenched when this limit is reached, unless there is a mechanism for
transferring the metals to larger grains and refreshing the very small grain
population, for example by grain coagulation and shattering in the diffuse ISM.
If Fe depletes onto the very small grains, then for reasonable coagulation
rates there is at least one metal atom per five C atoms in the very small grain
population. Furthermore, approximately 60% of the cosmic Fe is associated with
the carbonaceous grain population. It is unclear whether this scenario is
compatible with observations. However, if there is another population of very
small grains, with a large capacity for holding Fe atoms, it might be the sink
for the most heavily depleted elements.

line intensity rather than from continuum variation. These variations are
explained by fragmentation of matter at the time of head-on collision of the
winds from the two stars. A high velocity (500 km/s) wind component is revealed
from the fit of the SED of the continuum in the X-ray range in 1978, but is

Consistent Harmonic approximation, combined with an array of local modes. We
show that in the bcc phase the atomic local motion is highly directional and

motion in the bcc phase leads to a strong hybridization of the local modes with
the T$_{1}(110)$ phonon branch, which becomes much softer than that obtained

In addition we predict a high energy excitation branch which is important for
self-diffusion. Both the hybridization and the presence of a high energy branch
are a consequence of the correlation, and appear only in the bcc phase. We
suggest that the local modes can play the role in mass transport usually

complex - an analog of the Morse complex of Morse functions. Novikov complex is
defined over the ring of Laurent power series with finite negative part. The
main aim of this paper is to present a detailed and self-contained exposition
of the author's theorem saying that C^0-generically the Novikov complex is
defined over the ring of rational functions. The paper contains also a
systematic treatment of the topics of the classical Morse theory related to
Morse complexes (Chapter 2). We work with a new class of gradient-type vector
fields, which includes riemannian gradients. In Ch.3 we suggest a purely
Morse-theoretic (not using triangulations) construction of small handle
decomposition of manifolds. In the Ch.4 we deal with the gradients of Morse
functions on cobordisms. Due to the presence of critical points the descent
along the trajectories of such gradient does no define in general a continuous
map from the upper component of the boundary to the lower one. We show that for
C^0-generic gradients there is an algebraic model of ""gradient descent map"".
This is one of the main tools in the proof of the main theorem (Chapter 5). We
give also the generalizations of the result for the versions of Novikov complex
defined over completions of group rings (non commutative in general).
