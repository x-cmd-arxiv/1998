power spectrum of extinction during the Phanerozoic may take the form of 1/f
noise, a result which, it has been suggested, could be indicative of the
presence of ""critical dynamics"" in the processes giving rise to extinction. In
this paper we examine extinction power spectra in some detail, using
family-level data from a variety of different sources. We find that although
the average form of the power spectrum roughly obeys the 1/f law, the spectrum
can be represented more accurately by dividing it into two regimes: a
low-frequency one which is well fit by an exponential, and a high-frequency one
in which it follows a power law with a 1/f^2 form. We give explanations for the
occurrence of each of these behaviours and for the position of the cross-over
between them.

observationaly confirmed in 1919. In the following decades various aspects of
the gravitational lens effect were explored theoretically, among them the
possibility of multiple or ring-like images of background sources, the use of
lensing as a gravitational telescope on very faint and distant objects, and the
possibility to determine Hubble's constant with lensing. Only relatively
recently gravitational lensing became an observational science after the
discovery of the first doubly imaged quasar in 1979. Today lensing is a booming
part of astrophysics.
  In addition to multiply-imaged quasars, a number of other aspects of lensing
have been discovered since, e.g. giant luminous arcs, quasar microlensing,
Einstein rings, galactic microlensing events, arclets, or weak gravitational
lensing. By now literally hundreds of individual gravitational lens phenomena
are known.
  Although still in its childhood, lensing has established itself as a very
useful astrophysical tool with some remarkable successes. It has contributed
significant new results in areas as different as the cosmological distance
scale, the large scale matter distribution in the universe, mass and mass
distribution of galaxy clusters, physics of quasars, dark matter in galaxy
halos, or galaxy structure.

reconcile a flat universe with the many observations that find a density in
ordinary, clustered matter well below the critical density and also explain the
recent high redshift supernova data suggesting that the expansion of the
universe is now accelerating. For a perfect fluid negative presure leads to
instabilities that are most severe on the shortest scales. However, if instead
the dark matter is a solid, with an elastic resistance to pure shear
deformations, an equation of state with negative presure can avoid these short
wavelength instabilities. Such a solid may arise as the result of different
kinds of microphysics. Two possible candidates for a solid dark matter
component are a frustrated network of non-Abelian cosmic strings or a
frustrated network of domain walls. If these networks settle down to an
equilibrium configuration that gets carried along and stretched by the Hubble
flow, equations of state result with $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3,$ respectively. One
expects the sound speeds for the solid dark matter component to comprise an
appreciable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore, the solid dark matter
does not cluster, expect on the very largest scales, accessible only through
observing the large-angle CMB anisotropy. In this paper we develop a
generally-covariant, continuum description for the dynamics of a solid dark
matter component. We derive the evolution equations for the cosmological
perturbations in a flat universe with CDM+(solid) and compute the resulting
large-angle CMB anisotropy. The formalism presented here applies to any
generalized dark matter with negative pressure and a non-dissipative resistance
to shear.

universe with a neutrino component of dark matter provides the best existing
model to explain the observed structure of the universe over more than three
orders of magnitude in distance scale. In principle this hot dark matter could
consist of one, two, or three species of active neutrinos. If all present
indications for neutrino mass are correct, however, only the two-species (muon
neutrino and tau neutrino) possibility works. This requires the existence of at
least one light sterile neutrino to explain the solar electron neutrino deficit
via nu(e)->nu(s), leaving nu(mu)->nu(tau) as the explanation for the anomalous
nu(mu)/nu(e) ratio produced by atmospheric neutrinos, and having the LSND
experiment demonstrating via anti-nu(mu)-> anti-nu(e) the mass difference
between the light nu(e)-nu(s) pair and the heavier nu(mu)-nu(tau) pair required
for dark matter. Other experiments do not conflict with the LSND results when
all the experiments are analyzed in the same way, and when analyzed
conservatively the LSND data is quite compatible with the mass difference
needed for dark matter. Further support for this mass pattern is provided by
the need for a sterile neutrino to rescue heavy-element nucleosynthesis in
supernovae, and it could even aid the concordance in light element abundances
from the early universe.

resolved probe of the interstellar medium at high redshift on scales small

associated with the low ionization ""cloudlets"" is likely to be less than about
3000 M_solar and possibly less than 1 M_solar. The velocity shear seen across
the lines of sight is too large to be caused by galactic bulk motion, so the
velocity field of the low ionization gas must be strongly influenced by small
scale local gasdynamics. While it cannot presently be excluded that the
disturbances of the gas are due to high velocity outflows from the background
QSO, the observed velocity and density structure of the z=3.538 system is
consistent with our line of sight running through an expanding shell of gas,

central few parsecs of the Galaxy. These observations point to an episodic
history of star formation in the central region with several bursts having
occurred over the past few 100 Myr (e.g. Blum et al. 1996b). High resolution

there is a small increase in mean [Fe/H] from Baade's Window to the Galactic
Center and deduce a near solar value for stars in the central region. For
radial distances greater than 1$^{\circ}$ from the Galactic Center we fail to
find a measurable population of stars that are significantly younger than those

Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) at an effective wavelength of 175 $\mu$m. We
present here results we have obtained on the first field, the so-called Marano1
which covers around 0.25 square degree. We find that the source density for
objects with a flux above 200 mJy exceeds the counts expected for sources found
in the IRAS deep surveys with a similar flux by about an order of magnitude.
Such an excess was expected on the basis of the high far infrared background
detected with the FIRAS and DIRBE instruments aboard the Cosmic Background
Explorer (COBE). These sources are likely to be redshifted infrared galaxies.
The steep number counts indicate strong cosmological evolution in this
population. The detected sources account for only 10 % of the cosmic IR
background. An extrapolation of the counts down to about 10 mJy would be
needeed to account for the whole background at this wavelength.

slowly with time and whose star formation rates are described by continuous
bursts, or by high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies which form continuously
over an interval of $z \sim 0.5-3$ (and no higher). Although, in reality, a
mixture of galaxy types may be responsible for low-z D\lya systems, our models
predict that HSB galaxies form more dust, more rapidly, than LSB galaxies, and
that HSB galaxies may therefore obscure background QSOs and not give rise to
D\lya lines, as suggested by other researchers. Significantly, we find that the
rate at which HSB disks consume neutral gas is too fast to explain the observed
evolution in the neutral gas mass density with redshift, and that the
consumption of hydrogen by LSB galaxies better fits the data. This further
suggests that LSB disks may dominate the D\lya population at high-redshift.

the flux creep activation barriers U as a function of current density j, (ii)
the current-voltage characteristics E(j) in a typical range of 10^{-7} V/cm to
10^{-15} V/cm, and (iii) the critical current density j_c(0) at T = 0. Three
different regimes of vortex dynamics are observed: For temperatures T < 20 K
the activation barrier U(j) is logarithmic, no unique functional dependence
U(j) could be found for the intermediate temperature interval 20 K < T < 40 K,
and finally for T > 40 K the activation barrier U(j) follows a power-law
behavior with an exponent mu = 0.6. From the analysis of the data within the
weak collective pinning theory for strongly layered superconductors, it is
argued that for temperatures T < 20 K pancake-vortices are pinned individually,
while for temperatures T > 40 K pinning involves large collectively pinned
vortex bundles. A description of the vortex dynamics in the intermediate

different cases that are studied in detail: i) a quasiparticle (resonance) when
the renormalized frequency of the particle is above the frequency threshold of
the bath and ii) a stable renormalized `particle' state below this threshold.
The time evolution of the occupation number for the particle is evaluated
exactly using different approaches that yield to complementary insights. The
exact solution allows us to investigate the concept of the formation time of a
quasiparticle and to study the difference between the relaxation of the
distribution of bare particles and that of quasiparticles. We derive a
non-Markovian quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and
includes off-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell
contributions and the usual Boltzmann equation (energy conserving) are obtained

this problem are reexamined here. The primary technical novelty is that the
tetrad generally relativistic method of Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko for
describing a spinor particle is exploited. The choice of the formalism has
turned out to be of great fruitfulness for examining the system. It is matter
that, as known, the use of a special spherical tetrad in the theory of a spin
1/2 particle had led Schrodinger to a basis of remarkable features. The basis
has been used with great efficiency by Pauli in his investigation on the pro-
blem of allowed spherically symmetric wave functions in quantum mechanics. For
our purposes, just several simple rules extracted from the much more com-
prehensive Pauli's analysis will be quite sufficient; those are almost mnemo-
nic working regulations. So, one may remember some very primary facts of D-
functions theory and then produce automatically proper wave functions. It seems
rather likely, that there may exist a generalized analog of such a re-
presentation for J(i)-operators, that might be successfully used whenever in a
linear problem there exists a spherical symmetry, irrespective of the con-
crete embodiment of such a symmetry. In particular, the case of electron in the
external Abelian monopole field completely come under the Sch-Pau method.

fied with the approach that occurred with regard to a spin 1/2 particle and was
first developed by Tetrode, Weyl, Fock, Ivanenko. On that way a general- ly
relativistical Duffin-Kemmer equation is costructed. So, the manner of
extending the flat space Dirac equation to general relativity case indicates
clearly that the Lorentz group underlies equally both these theories. In other
words, the Lorentz group retains its importance and significance at changing
the Minkowski space model to an arbitrary curved space-time. In contrast to
this, at generalizing the Proca formulation, we automatically destroy any
relations to the Lorentz group, although the definition itself for a spin 1
particle as an elementary object was based on just this group. Such a gravity's
sensitiveness to the fermion-boson division might appear rather strange and
unattractive asymmetry, being subjected to the criticism. Moreover, just this
feature has brought about a plenty of speculation on this matter. In any case,
this peculiarity of particle-gravity field inter- action is recorded almost in
