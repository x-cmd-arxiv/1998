the two types of object should show similar isotropically emitted X-ray
emission. Testing this is usually limited by difficulties in separating strong
X-ray emission from a BL Lac nucleus and surrounding low-surface brightness
emission. In this paper we report ROSAT HRI observations of the z=0.055 BL Lac
object PKS 0521-365. We are able to separate a luminous extended X-ray
component from the bright nucleus. Using a new radio map, we show that it is
unlikely that the extended emission is due to inverse-Compton scattering of
photons from the active nucleus, and instead interpret it as thermal emission
from dense, rapidly cooling gas. This is a more extreme environment than is
found in typical FRI radio galaxies, and may pose a problem for unified models.

  interior","LaTeX 24 pages, 14 PS figures, text improved, new references added",,,,"astro-ph hep-ph",,"  It is shown that in the presence of a background magnetic field within solar
interior a cavity for low frequency MHD eigen modes (with periods 1-10 days)
near equatorial plane can arise. The lower boundary of the cavity coincides
with the centre of the Sun while the upper one corresponds to the Alfven
resonant layer where high accumulation of wave energy takes place. The
localization and the width of the Alfven resonance layer are determined by: (i)
the node number of eigen modes n = 1, 2,..., (ii) by the angle of oblique
propagation of waves with respect to the magnetic field, and (iii) by a low
magnitude of the background magnetic field itself, B=1-100 G. The amplitude of
eigen oscillations in a resonant layer determines the density fluctuation value
that is restricted through the imaginary part of eigen frequences. For large
node numbers n>>1 there appear many narrow resonant layers where a neutrino
propagates through a large density fluctuation \delta\rho/\rho with the
oscillation length that is much bigger than the width of a resonant layer. It
is shown that neutrino crosses many such bumps on the exponential background
profile that motivates to consider these MHD waves as a plausible matter noise
for the MSW solution to the Solar Neutrino Problem (SNP).

ejections from GRS 1915+105 in 1997 October / November. The observations were
made at a time of complex radio behaviour, corresponding to multiple
optically-thin outbursts and several days of rapid radio flux oscillations. The
radio imaging resolved four major ejection events from the system. As
previously reported from earlier VLA observations of the source, we observe
apparent superluminal motions resulting from intrinsically relativistic motions
of the ejecta. However, our measured proper motions are significantly greater
than those observed on larger angular scales with the VLA. Under the assumption
of an intrinsically symmetric ejection, we can place an upper limit on the
distance to GRS 1915+105 of 11.2 +/- 0.8 kpc. Solutions for the velocities
unambiguously require a higher intrinsic speed by about 0.1c than that derived
from the earlier VLA observations, whilst the angle to the line-of-sight is not
found to be significantly different. At a distance of 11 kpc, we obtain
solutions of v = 0.98 (-0.05,+0.02)c and theta = 66 +/- 2 degrees. The jet also
appears to be curved on a scale which corresponds to a period of around 7 days.
We observe significant evolution of the linear polarisation of the approaching
component, with large rotations in position angle and a general decrease in
fractional polarisation. The power input into the formation of the jet is very
large, >10^38 erg/s at 11 kpc for a pair plasma. If the plasma contains a cold
proton for each electron, then the mass outflow rate, >10^18 g/sec is
comparable to inflow rates previously derived from X-ray spectral fits.

addition, the NEWSIPS flux calibration is shown to be inconsistent by nearly
10%.
  We examine the origin of these problems and proceed to formulate and apply

detected by COMPTEL from this source is probably also responsible for a large
fraction of the observed $^{26}$Al emission in the Vela region detected by the
same instrument. The first conclusion is based on the fact that the remnant is
currently expanding too slowly given its young age for it to be caused by a
Type Ia supernova. If the current SNR shell expansion speed is greater than
3000 km/s, a $15 M_\odot$ Type II supernova with a moderate kinetic energy
exploding at about 150 pc away is favored. If the SNR expansion speed is lower
than 2000 km s$^{-1}$, as derived naively from the X-ray data, a much more
energetic supernova is required to have occurred at $\sim250$ pc away in a
dense environment at the edge of the Gum nebula. This progenitor has a
preferred ejecta mass of $\le10 M_\odot$ and therefore, it is probably a Type
Ib or Type Ic supernova. However, the required high ambient density of $n_H \ge
100 cm^{-3}$ in this scenario is difficult to reconcile with the regional CO
data. A combination of our estimates of the age/energetics of the new SNR and
the almost perfect positional coincidence of the new SNR with the centroid of
the COMPTEL $ ^{26}$Al emission feature of the Vela region strongly favors a
causal connection. If confirmed, this will be the first case where both

symmetric time profiles. There are a few time intervals where the flux rises
steadily and then drops suddenly, sometimes to a level lower than the average
before the increase. Hardness ratios showed that the source was slightly softer
when the flux was brighter. The power density spectra (PDS) were also
complicated and we found that broken power laws do not provide adequate fits to

evident, probably an example of the extended HII envelopes postulated as the
origin of weak recombination-line emission detected from the Galactic ridge.
Our polarization observations can be understood if the uniform magnetic field
component in this envelope scales with the square-root of electron density and
is 20 microG at the edge of the depolarized region around W4, although this is
probably an over-estimate since the random field component will have a
significant effect.

distribution of abundances is several times broader, spanning over 1 decade.
None of the PNe in our sample approach the super metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~ +0.25)
expectations for the bulge of M31, although a few PNe in the sample of
Stasinska, Richer, & Mc~Call (1998) come close. This [O/H] vs [Fe/H]
discrepancy is likely due to a combination of factors, including an inability
of metal-rich stars to produce bright PNe, a luminosity selection effect, and
an abundance gradient in the bulge of M31. We show that PNe that are near the
bright limit of the [OIII] 5007 planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF)
span nearly a decade in oxygen abundance, and thus, support the use of the PNLF
for deriving distances to galaxies (Jacoby 1996) with differing metallicities.
We also identify a correlation between central star mass and PN dust formation
that partially alleviates any dependence of the PNLF maximum magnitude on
population age. Additionally, we identify a spatially compact group of 5 PNe
having unusually high O/H; this subgroup may arise from a recent merger, but
velocity information is needed to assess the true nature of the objects.

periods for a representative sample of stars in the young (30 Myr) open cluster
IC 2602. Rotation periods were derived for 29 of 33 stars monitored. The
periods derived range from 0.2d (one of the shortest known rotation periods of
any single open cluster star) to about 10d (which is almost twice as long as
the longest period previously known for a cluster of this age). We are able to
confirm 8 previously known periods and derive 21 new ones, delineating the long
period end of the distribution. Despite our sensitivity to longer periods, we
do not detect any variables with periods longer than about 10d. The combination
of these data with those for IC 2391, an almost identical cluster, leads to the
following conclusions:
  1) The fast rotators in a 30 Myr cluster are distributed across the entire
0.5 < B-V < 1.6 color range.
  2) 6 stars in our sample are slow rotators, with periods longer than 6d.
  3) The amplitude of variability depends on both the color and the period. The
dependence on the latter might be important in understanding the selection
effects in the currently available rotation period database and in planning
future observations.
  4) The interpretation of these data in terms of theoretical models of
rotating stars suggests both that disk-interaction is the norm rather than the
exception in young stars and that disk-locking times range from zero to a few
Myr.

clusters in the starburst galaxy M82. The data for cluster F and the nearby,
highly reddened cluster L were obtained with the William Herschel Telescope
(WHT) at a resolution of 1.6A. The blue spectrum (3250-5540A) of cluster F
shows features typical of mid-B stars. The red spectra (5730-8790A) of clusters
F and L show the Ca II triplet and numerous F and G-type absorption features.
Strong Ca II and Na I interstellar absorption lines arising in M82 are also
detected, and the 6283A diffuse interstellar band appears to be present. The
quality of the WHT spectra allows us to considerably improve previous age
estimates for cluster F. By comparing the blue spectrum with theoretical model
cluster spectra using the PEGASE spectral synthesis code (Fioc &
Rocca-Volmerange 1997), we derive an age of 60+/-20 Myr. The strength of the Ca
II triplet is also in accord with this age. Cluster L appears to have a similar
age, although this is much less certain. The measured radial velocities for the
two clusters differ substantially, indicating that they are located in
different regions of the M82 disk. Cluster F appears to be deep in M82,
slightly beyond the main starburst region while the highly obscured cluster L
lies near the outer edges of the disk. We derive an absolute V magnitude of
-16.5 for F indicating that it is an extremely massive cluster. The presence of
such a luminous super star cluster suggests that the M82 starburst experienced
an episode of intense star formation approximately 60 Myr ago.

recombination mechanisms of (i) thresholdless, (ii) quasi-threshold, and (iii)

temperature only slightly. The rate of the quasi-threshold Auger process
depends on temperature exponentially. However, its threshold energy essentially
varies with quantum well width and is close to zero for narrow quantum wells.
It is shown that the thresholdless and the quasi-threshold Auger processes
dominate in narrow quantum wells, while the threshold and the quasi-threshold
processes prevail in wide quantum wells. The limiting case of a
three-dimensional (3D)Auger process is reached for infinitely wide quantum
wells. The critical quantum well width is found at which the quasi-threshold

studied is phonon-assisted Auger recombination in quantum wells. It is shown
that for narrow quantum wells the act of phonon emission becomes resonant,

recombination. Conditions are found under which the direct Auger process

normal metal that competes with the localizing effects of the disorder. The
instability is characterized by a diverging length scale, and has all of the
characteristics of a continuous phase transition. The transition and the
properties of the ordered phase are studied in mean-field theory, and by taking
into account Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the ordered phase is indeed a
superconductor with an ordinary Meissner effect and a free energy that is lower
than that of the normal metal. Various technical points that have given rise to
confusion in connection with this and other manifestations of odd-gap

alternate descriptions that are based on the notion of neutral quasi-particles

in the FCS approach is also obtained from the alternate approach, provided that
one properly takes into account a peculiar symmetry of the dipolar
quasiparticles --- the invariance of their energy to a shift of their center of
mass momentum. Here, we demonstrate the equivalence of these two approaches in
detail. We first study a model where the charge and flux of each fermion is
smeared over a radius Q^{-1} where results can be calculated to leading order
in the small parameter Q/k_f. We study two dipolar-quasiparticle descriptions
of the nu=1/2 state in the small-Q model and confirm that they yield the same
density response function as in the FCS approach. We also study the
single-particle Green's function and the effective mass, for one form of
dipolar quasiparticles, and find the effective mass to be infra-red divergent,
exactly as in the FCS approach. Finally, we propose a form for a Fermi-liquid
theory for the dipolar quasiparticles, which should be valid in the physical

MAA the actual type of the alloy analogy is determined selfconsistently. The
MAA allows, in particular, the investigation of quasiparticle lifetime effects
in the paramagnetic as well as the ferromagnetic phase. For thin fcc(100) and

temperature as well as film thickness. The magnetization at the surface-layer

the hadronization pattern of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
undergoing a first order phase transition. A coalescence model is proposed to
describe the evolution dynamics of hadronic clusters produced in the nucleation
process. The size distribution of the nucleated clusters is important for the
description of the plasma conversion. The model is most sensitive to the
initial conditions of the QGP thermalization, time evolution of the energy
density, and the interfacial energy of the plasma-hadronic matter interface.
The rapidly expanding QGP is first supercooled by about $\Delta T = T - T_c =
4-6 %$. Then it reheats again up to the critical temperature T_c. Finally it
breaks up into hadronic clusters and small droplets of plasma. This fast
dynamics occurs within the first $5-10 fm/c$. The finite size effects and
fluctuations near the critical temperature are studied. It is shown that a drop
of longitudinally expanding QGP of the transverse radius below 4.5 fm can
display a long-lived metastability. However, both in the rapid and in the
delayed hadronization scenario, the bulk pion yield is emitted by sources as
large as 3-4.5 fm. This may be detected experimentally both by a HBT
interferometry signal and by the analysis of the rapidity distributions of
particles in narrow p_T-intervals at small p_T on an event-by-event basis.

BPS configuration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We show
that the physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmann

propose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one real
fundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle with
composite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane model
with nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically. The introduction of D=11
Lorentz harmonics provides the possibility to construct massless D=11
superparticle model which can be formulated in a way preserving 1/2, 17/32,

The input is the second eexterior power operation in the representation ring of

giving the Adams operation psi^2 in K(E8).
  Eigenvectors of psi^2 must also be eigenvectors of psi^k for any k. The
matrix of these eigenvectors is the key to the analysis. Its determinant is
closely related to the homotopy decomposition of E8 localized at each prime. By
taking careful combinations of eigenvectors, we obtain a set of generators of

"quant-ph/9812020","Mor Tal","Tal Mor","On the Disentanglement of States","4 pages, RevTeX; email: talmo@ee.ucla.edu",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Disentanglement is the process which transforms a state $\rho$ of two
subsystems into an unentangled state, while not effecting the reduced density
matrices of each of the two subsystems. Recently Terno showed that an arbitrary
state cannot be disentangled into a tensor product of its reduced density
matrices. In this letter we present various novel results regarding
disentanglement of states. Our main result is that there are sets of states
which cannot be successfuly disentangled (not even into a separable state).
Thus, we prove that a universal disentangling machine cannot exist.
