turbulent viscosity results in instability of both pinching oscillations, and
bending modes. Not only the low-frequency fundamental modes, but also the
high-frequency reflective harmonics appear to be unstable. The question of the
limits of applicability of the thin disk model (MTD) is also investigated. The
insignificant distinctions in the dispersion properties of MTD and
three-dimensional model appear for wave numbers k<(1-3)/h (h is the
half-thickness of a disk). In the long-wavelenght limit, the relative
difference between eigenfrequencies of the unstable acoustic mode in the
3D-model and the MTD is smaller than 5%.

the radio counterpart of the unusual X-ray binary Cir X-1 into an asymmetric
extended structure on arcsecond scales. In order to quantify the asymmetry we
have redetermined as accurately as possible both the optical and radio
coordinates of the source. The extended emission can be understood as a
compact, absorbed core at the location of the X-ray binary, and extended
emission up to 2 arcsec to the southeast of the core. The arcsec-scale extended
emission aligns with the larger, more symmetric arcmin-scale collimated
structures in the surrounding synchrotron nebula. This suggests that the
transport of mass and/or energy from the X-ray binary to the synchroton nebula
is occurring via the arcsec-scale structures. The ratio of extended flux from
the southeast to that from the northwest of the core is at least 2:1.
Interpreted as relativistic aberration of an intrinsically symmetric jet from
the source, this implies a minimum outflow velocity of 0.1 c. Alternatively,
the emission may be intrinsically asymmetric, perhaps as a result of the high
space velocity of the system.

than its stationary states with respect to its energy. In this paper, we have
investigated moduli $\CMeP$ of a quantized elastica, a quantized loop with an
energy functional associated with the Schwarz derivative, on a Riemann sphere
$\PP$. Then it is proved that its moduli space is decomposed to a set of
equivalent classes determined by flows obeying the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)
hierarchy which conserve the energy. Since the flow obeying the KdV hierarchy
has a natural topology, it induces topology in the moduli space $\CMeP$. Using
the topology, $\CMeP$ is classified. Studies on a loop space in the category of
topological spaces $\Top$ are well-established and its cohomological properties
are well-known. As the moduli space of a quantized elastica can be regarded as
a loop space in the category of differential geometry $\DGeom$, we also proved
an existence of a functor between a triangle category related to a loop space
in {\bf Top} and that in $\DGeom$ using the induced topology. As Euler
investigated the elliptic integrals and its moduli by observing a shape of
classical elastica on $\CC$, this paper devotes relations between hyperelliptic
curves and a quantized elastica on $\PP$ as an extension of Euler's perspective
of elastica.
