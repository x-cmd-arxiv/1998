Mauritius, an island in the Indian ocean, at a latitude of -20.14 deg. The
Mauritius Radio Telescope (MRT) is a Fourier Synthesis T-shaped array,
consisting of a 2048 m long East-West arm and a 880 m long South arm. In the
East-West arm 1024 fixed helices are arranged in 32 groups and in the South arm
16 trolleys, with four helices on each, which move on a rail are used. A 512
channel digital complex correlation receiver is used to measure the visibility
function. At least 60 days of observing are required for obtaining the
visibilities up to 880 m spacing. The Fourier transform of the calibrated
visibilities produces a map of the area of the sky under observation with a
synthesized beam width 4'X 4.6'sec(dec+20.14) at 151.5 MHz.
  The primary objective of the telescope is to produce a sky survey in the
declination range -70 deg to -10 deg with a point source sensitivity of about
200 mJy (3-sigma level). This will be the southern sky equivalent of the
Cambridge 6C survey. In this paper we describe the telescope, discuss the array
design and the calibration techniques used, and present a map made using the
telescope.

baryonic density parameter (considering however a purely baryonic Universe), as
well as different density perturbation spectra, in order to see their influence
on the behavior of the Population III objects evolution. We find, for example,
that the first mass that collapses is $8.5\times10^4M_\odot$ for $h=1$,

mass that collapses. The cooling-heating and photon drag processes have a key
role in the collapse of the clouds and in their thermal history. Our results
show, for example, that when we disregard the Compton cooling-heating, the
collapse of the objects with masses $>8.5\times10^4M_\odot$ occurs earlier. On
the other hand, disregarding the photon drag process, the collapse occurs at a
higher redshift.

studied the dynamical evolution of these clouds in two ways: purely baryonic
clouds and clouds with non-baryonic dark matter included. We start the
calculations at the beginning of the recombination era, following the evolution
of the structure until the collapse (that we defined as the time when the
density contrast of the baryonic matter is greater than $10^4$). We analyze the
behavior of the several physical parameters of the clouds (as, e.g., the
density contrast and the velocities of the baryonic matter and the dark matter)
as a function of time and radial position in the cloud. In this study all
physical processes that are relevant to the dynamical evolution of the
primordial clouds, as for example photon-drag (due to the cosmic background
radiation), hydrogen molecular production, besides the expansion of the
Universe, are included in the calculations. In particular we find that the
clouds, with dark matter, collapse at higher redshift when we compare the
results with the purely baryonic models. As a general result we find that the
distribution of the non-baryonic dark matter is more concentrated than the
baryonic one. It is important to stress that we do not take into account the
putative virialization of the non-baryonic dark matter, we just follow the time
and spatial evolution of the cloud solving its hydrodynamical equations. We
studied also the role of the cooling-heating processes in the purely baryonic

planets via microlensing. This new strategy is designed to detect planets in
""wide"" orbits, i.e., with orbital separation, $a$ greater than $\sim 1.5 R_E$.
Planets in wide orbits may provide the dominant channel for the microlensing
discovery of planets, particularly low-mass (e.g., Earth-mass) planets. This
paper concentrates on events in which a single planet serves as a lens, leading
to an isolated event of short duration. We point out that a distribution of
events due to lensing by stars with wide-orbit planets is necessarily
accompanied by a distribution of shorter- duration events. The fraction of
events in the latter distribution is proportional to the average value of
$\sqrt{q}$, where $q$ is the ratio between \pl and stellar masses. The position
of the peak or peaks also provides a measure of the mass ratios typical of
planetary systems. We study detection strategies that can optimize our ability
to discover isolated short-duration events due to lensing by planets, and find
that monitoring employing sensitive photometry is particularly useful. If
planetary systems similar to our own are common, even modest changes in
detection strategy should lead to the discovery of a few isolated events of
short duration every year. We therefore also address the issue of the
contamination due to stellar populations of any microlensing signal due to
low-mass MACHOs. We describe how, even for isolated events of short duration,
it will be possible to test the hypothesis that the lens was a planet instead
of a low-mass MACHO, if the central star of the planetary system contributes a
measurable fraction of the baseline flux.

(pseudo) Riemannian geometry on finite and discrete sets. On a finite set,
there is a counterpart of the continuum metric tensor with a simple geometric
interpretation. The latter is based on a correspondence between first order
differential calculi and digraphs. Arrows originating from a vertex span its
(co)tangent space. If the metric is to measure length and angles at some point,
it has to be taken as an element of the left-linear tensor product of the space
of 1-forms with itself, and not as an element of the (non-local) tensor product
over the algebra of functions. It turns out that linear connections can always
be extended to this left tensor product, so that metric compatibility can be
defined in the same way as in continuum Riemannian geometry. In particular, in
the case of the universal differential calculus on a finite set, the Euclidean
geometry of polyhedra is recovered from conditions of metric compatibility and
vanishing torsion. In our rather general framework (which also comprises
structures which are far away from continuum differential geometry), there is
in general nothing like a Ricci tensor or a curvature scalar. Because of the
non-locality of tensor products (over the algebra of functions) of forms,
corresponding components (with respect to some module basis) turn out to be
rather non-local objects. But one can make use of the parallel transport
associated with a connection to `localize' such objects and in certain cases
there is a distinguished way to achieve this. This leads to covariant
components of the curvature tensor which then allow a contraction to a Ricci
tensor. In the case of a differential calculus associated with a hypercubic
lattice we propose a new discrete analogue of the (vacuum) Einstein equations.

nucleation. Our approach is based on a coarse-grained free energy that
incorporates the effect of fluctuations with momenta above a scale k. The
nucleation rate I = A_k exp(-S_k) is exponentially suppressed by the action S_k
of the saddle-point configuration that dominates tunnelling. The factor A_k
includes a fluctuation determinant around this saddle point. Both S_k and A_k
depend on the choice of k, but, for 1/k close to the characteristic length
scale of the saddle point, this dependence cancels in the expression for the
nucleation rate. For very weak first-order phase transitions or in the vicinity
of the spinodal decomposition line, the pre-exponential factor A_k compensates
the exponential suppression exp(-S_k). In these regions the standard nucleation
picture breaks down. We give an approximate expression for A_k in terms of the
saddle-point profile, which can be used for quantitative estimates and
practical tests of the validity of homogeneous nucleation theory.

QCD. We also construct a set of gauge-invariant operator-valued quark and gluon
fields by establishing an explicit unitary equivalence between the Gauss's law
operator and the `pure glue' part of the Gauss's law operator. This unitary
equivalence enables us to use the `pure glue' Gauss's law operator to represent
the entire Gauss's law operator in a new representation. Since the quark field
commutes with the `pure glue' Gauss's law operator, it is a gauge-invariant
field in this new representation. We use the unitary equivalence of the new and
the conventional representations to construct gauge-invariant quark and gluon
fields in both representations, and to transform the QCD Hamiltonian in the
temporal gauge so that it is expressed entirely in terms of gauge-invariant
quantities. In that form, all interactions between quark fields mediated by
`pure gauge' components of the gluon field have been transformed away, and
replaced by a nonlocal interaction between gauge-invariant color-charge
densities. This feature --- that, in gauge-invariant formulations, interactions
mediated by pure gauge components of gauge fields have been replaced by
nonlocal interactions --- is shared by many gauge theories. In QED, the
resulting nonlocal interaction is the Coulomb interaction, which is the Abelian
analog of the QCD interaction we have identified and are describing in this
work. The leading term, in a multipole expansion, of this nonlocal QCD
interaction vanishes for quarks in color-singlet configurations, suggesting a
dynamical origin for color confinement; higher order terms of this multipole
expansion suggest a QCD mechanism for color transparency. We also show how, in
an SU(2) model, this nonlocal interaction can be evaluated nonperturbatively.

model, and a description which generates a negative binomial description. The
approach developed can be used to discuss other cases which will be mentioned.
The pion probability distributions for these various cases are compared.
Comparison of the pion laser model and Bose-Einstein condensation in a laser
trap and with the thermal model are made. The thermal model and hydrodynamic
model are also used to illustrate why the number of pions never diverges and
why the Bose-Einstein correction effects are relatively small. The pion
emission strength $\eta$ of a Poisson emitter and a critical density $\eta_c$
are connected in a thermal model by $\eta/n_c = e^{-m/T} < 1$, and this fact
reduces any Bose-Einstein correction effects in the number and number
fluctuation of pions. Fluctuations can be much larger than Poisson in the pion
laser model and for a negative binomial description. The clan representation of
the negative binomial distribution due to Van Hove and Giovannini is discussed
using the present description. Applications to CERN/NA44 and CERN/NA49 data are
discussed in terms of the relativistic hydrodynamic model.
