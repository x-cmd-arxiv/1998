and are therefore clearly the result of galaxy-galaxy interactions. The host
galaxies of polar rings are typically gas-poor early-type systems. The rings
themselves, however, are typically gas-rich, blue, star-forming systems. They
have traditionally been modelled as the remnants of accreted dwarf irregular
galaxies. Published results on the molecular gas content, and nebular
abundances argue against this model. We present H-alpha imaging data for three
polar-ring galaxies, and derive their HII region luminosity functions. In all
three galaxies, the HII region luminosity functions are much steeper than found
for any dwarf galaxy. The slopes are generally closer to those of Sa galaxies.
Thus the HII region LFs of polar rings join the ISM abundances in resembling
the very earliest-type spirals galaxies, rather than their supposed dwarf
irregular precursors.

the intercloud medium and compare with unevolved cases.
  We find that: In the (i) aligned case, adiabatic collisions, like their HD
counterparts, are very disruptive, independent of the cloud symmetry. However,
when radiative processes are taken into account, partial coalescence takes
place even in the asymmetric case, unlike the HD calculations. In the (ii)
transverse case, collisions between initially adjacent unevolved clouds are
almost unaffected by magnetic fields. However, the interaction with the
magnetized intercloud gas during the pre-collision evolution produces a region
of very high magnetic energy in front of the cloud. In collisions between
evolved clouds with transverse field geometry, this region acts like a
``bumper'', preventing direct contact between the clouds, and eventually
reverses their motion. The ``elasticity'', defined as the ratio of the final to
the initial kinetic energy of each cloud, is about 0.5-0.6 in the cases we
considered. This behavior is found both in adiabatic and radiative cases.

self-similar fashion into a stationary Navarro-Frenk-White halo and the

the accretion shock, the de Vaucouleurs stellar system is constructed and the
energy from Type II supernovae is released. The stars and dark halo are matched
to NGC 4472. Gas continues to enter the galaxy by secondary infall and by
stellar mass loss based on a Salpeter IMF. After about 13 Gyrs the temperature

the present day baryonic fraction has a deep minimum in the outer galactic

interacting matter as a function of temperature and baryon density, obtained
using a model for two-flavor QCD in which the interaction between quarks is
modelled on that induced by instantons. The phase diagram has a chiral symmetry
breaking vacuum, a color superconductor phase at high density, and a mixed
phase in between which can describe nuclear matter if the high density regions
in the mixed phase form droplets. This is amusingly similar to the phase
diagram of the copper oxide superconductors, although their critical
temperatures are smaller by a factor of about 10^{-9} and their mixed phase
seems to form stripes, rather than droplets. This and other approaches to QCD
with two massless quarks suggests the existence of a tricritical point on the
boundary of the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. In QCD with
massive quarks there is then a critical point at the end of a first order
transition line. We discuss possible experimental signatures of this point,
which provide information about its location and properties. We propose a
combination of event-by-event observables, including suppressed fluctuations in
T and mu and, simultaneously, enhanced fluctuations in the multiplicity of soft
pions. As a control parameter (like the collision energy) is varied, the
fluctuations of appropriate event-by-event observables should therefore have
minima or maxima. Experimental detection of these non-monotonic signatures
would confirm that the matter was initially above the chiral phase transition,
increasing our confidence in the interpretation of monotonic changes in other
observables, and would teach us much about the QCD phase diagram.

stacks) in mixed characteristic. We follow an idea of R. Pandharipande, and
define the complete Hurwitz stack as a substack of stable maps of degree d of
nodal pointed curves of genus g to the universal curve over the moduli stack of
stable pointed curves of genus h. This substack is simply the closure of the
locus of Hurwitz covers in characteristic 0.
  We describe in detail the reduction modulo 2 of the complete Hurwitz stack of
genus 1 double covers of the projective line. The result is wilder than you
would imagine in your wildest dreams.
  We end by speculating about a possible relationship with the work of
Abramovich-Vistoli about stable maps into Deligne-Mumford stacks.

also find an increase by a factor of 15-20 in the low mass dileptons and soft

significant enhancement of the experimental value of R(phi/omega) over this

widely separated zeros. We require these initial conditions to be locally close
to a stationary solution (the ``kink'' solution) except for a perturbation
supported in a small interval between the two kinks. We show that such a
perturbation vanishes on a time scale much shorter than the time scale for the
motion of the kinks. The consequences of this bound, in the context of earlier
studies of the dynamics of kinks in the Ginzburg-Landau equation, [ER], are as
follows: we consider initial conditions $v_0$ whose restriction to a bounded
interval $I$ have several zeros, not too regularly spaced, and other zeros of
$v_0$ are very far from $I$. We show that all these zeros eventually disappear
by colliding with each other. This relaxation process is very slow: it takes a
time of order exponential of the length of $I$.
