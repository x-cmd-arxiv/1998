lensed pairs of galaxies identified recently with the Hubble Space Telescope.
We explore a wider range of lens models than before, and find that the Hubble
constant is not tightly constrained once elliptical lens models are considered.
We also discuss the systematic uncertainties caused by the cluster containing
the lens galaxy. We conclude that additional observations of the candidate
lensed galaxies as well as direct measurements of the cluster mass profile are
needed before an accurate value of the Hubble constant can be derived from this

  Letters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We have detected the S(1), S(2), S(3), S(4) and S(5) pure rotational lines of
molecular hydrogen toward the outflow source HH 54, using the Short Wavelength
Spectrometer (SWS) on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The observed
H2 line ratios indicate the presence of warm molecular gas with an H2 density
of at least 100,000 per cubic centimeter and a temperature ~ 650 K in which the
ortho- to para-H2 ratio is only 1.2 +/- 0.4, significantly smaller than the
equilibrium ratio of 3 expected in gas at that temperature. These observations
imply that the measured ortho- to para-H2 ratio is the legacy of an earlier
stage in the thermal history of the gas when the gas had reached equilibrium at
a temperature < 90 K. Based upon the expected timescale for equilibration, we
argue that the non-equilibrium ortho- to para-H2 ratio observed in HH 54 serves
as a chronometer that places a conservative upper limit ~ 5000 yr on the period
for which the emitting gas has been warm. The S(2)/S(1) and S(3)/S(1) H2 line
ratios measured toward HH 54 are consistent with recent theoretical models of
Timmermann for the conversion of para- to ortho-H2 behind slow, `C'-type
shocks, but only if the preshock ortho- to para-H2 ratio was < 0.2.

stars of binary systems are assumed to be circularly orbiting each other but
rotating nonsynchronously with the orbital motion, i.e. stars in binary systems
have steady motions seen from a rotational frame of reference. We have computed
several equilibrium sequences by taking fully into account the tidal effect of
Newtonian gravity without approximation. We consider two binary systems
consisting of either 1) a point mass and a fluid star or 2) a fluid star and a
fluid star. Each of them corresponds to generalization of the Roche--Riemann or
the Darwin--Riemann problem, respectively. Our code can be applied to various
types of incompressible binary systems with various mass ratios and spin as
long as the vorticity is constant. We compare these equilibrium sequences of
binaries with approximate solutions which were studied extensively by Lai,
Rasio and Shapiro (LRS) as models for neutron star--neutron star (NS--NS)
binary systems or black hole--neutron star (BH--NS) binary systems. Our results
coincide qualitatively with those of LRS but are different from theirs for
configurations with small separations. For these binary systems, our sequences
show that dynamical or secular instability sets in as the separation decreases.
The quantitative errors of the ellipsoidal approximation amount to 2\sim 10%
for configurations near the instability point. Compared to the results of LRS,
the separation of the stars at the point where the instability sets in is
larger and correspondingly the orbital frequency at the critical state is
smaller for our models.

solar, close to the star cluster. Grains survive throughout. The Trapezium

against the photodissociation region (PDR). The nebula is in a state of energy
equipartition between energy input from starlight and energy stored in gas
pressure, kinetic outflow, and the magnetic field. There is much that is not
clear, however. How can gas flow away from the PDR into the face of a radiation
field that produces such effective radiative acceleration? Grains are
photoionized by the stellar radiation field, and this charge establishes a
Coulomb drag that couples the grains to the gas. The grains drift relative to
the gas, with speeds of order a fraction of a km s^-1. The grains can drift an
appreciable fraction of the thickness of the ionized larger in a timescale of
roughly 10^5 yr. The age of the geometry is unknown since the motion of t1 C
Ori is unknown. The likely equilibrium is one where grains drift away from the
illuminated face of the HII region and accumulate near the PDR. The ionized gas
then expands into the direction of the central star cluster, looses its
emission measure, and eventually becomes invisible. The loss of photoelectric
grain heating may cause a dramatic change in the temperature, and provide a
natural explanation for the temperature fluctuations phenomenon. The role of
the magnetic field in controlling properties of the HII region is unclear,

it is not possible to explain the observed morphology in the vicinity of the
turnoff unless the overshooting is quite extensive. Interestingly, if
sufficient overshooting is assumed in order to match the main-sequence data, it
is not possible to reproduce the cluster's extended giant branch unless the
cluster age is at least 1.6 Gyr (assuming a metallicity in the range -0.2 <=
[Fe/H] <= 0.0). This, in turn, requires that the cluster have an apparent
distance modulus (m-M)_V <= 12.2. Thus, sometime within the past few hundred
million years, the ignition of helium burning in NGC 7789 has switched from a
quiescent to an explosive (``flash'') phenomenon, and the length of the
cluster's red-giant branch has been steadily increasing with the passage of
time since then. From main-sequence fits to models that have been carefully
normalized to the Sun, we infer a reddening 0.35 <= E(V-I) <= 0.38.

field. Using this velocity potential we can derive a set of basic equations for
stationary states which consist of (i) the generalized Bernoulli equation, (ii)
the Poisson equation for the Newtonian gravitational potential and (iii) the
equation for the velocity potential with the Neumann type boundary condition.
We succeeded in developing a new code to compute numerically exact solutions to
these equations for the first time. Such irrotational configurations of binary
systems are appropriate models for realistic neutron star binaries composed of
inviscid gases, just prior to coalescence of two stars caused by emission of
gravitational waves. Accuracies of our numerical solutions are so high that we
can compute reliable models for fully deformed final stationary configurations
and hence determine the inner most stable circular orbit of binary neutron star
systems under the approximations of weak gravity and inviscid limit.

Magellanic Cloud. The combined microlensing optical depth of the MACHO and
EROS-1 surveys is tau_LMC = 2.1{+1.3/-0.8}* 10^{-7} which is substantially
larger than the background of tau < 0.5* 10^{-7} from lensing by known stars
but is below the expected microlensing optical depth of tau = 4.7*10^{-7} for a
halo composed entirely of Machos. The simplest interpretation of this result is
that nearly half of the dark halo is composed of Machos with a typical mass of
order 0.5 Msun. These Machos could be old white dwarfs, but it is not obvious
that the generation of stars that preceded these white dwarfs could have gone
undetected. Perhaps, the Machos could be non-baryonic, but there is no
compelling model for the formation of non-baryonic Machos. Therefore, some
authors have tried to develop alternative models which attempt to explain the
LMC microlensing results with non-halo lenses. Many of these models postulate
previously unknown dark stellar populations which contribute significantly to
the total mass of the Galaxy and are therefore simply variations of the dark
matter solution. However, models which postulate an unknown dwarf galaxy along
the line of sight to the LMC or a distortion of the LMC which significantly
enhances the LMC self-lensing optical depth can potentially explain the LMC
lensing results with only a small amount of mass, so these can be regarded as
true non-dark matter solutions to the Macho puzzle. All such models that have
been proposed so far have serious problems, so there is as yet no compelling
alternative to the dark matter interpretation. However, the problem can be
solved observationally with a second generation gravitational microlensing
survey that is significantly more sensitive than current microlensing surveys.

barrier with minimum imaginary action. The matrix element is computed by
integrating across the orbit in a surface of section representation, and uses
only the wavefunction in the allowed region and the stability properties of the

of the degree of scarring of the wavefunction. This scarring measure is
canonically invariant and independent of the choice of surface of section,
within semiclassical error. The result can alternatively be interpretated as
the autocorrelation function of the state with respect to a transfer operator
which quantises a certain complex surface of section mapping. The formula
provides an efficient numerical method to compute tunnelling rates while
avoiding the need for the exceedingly precise diagonalisation endemic to
numerical tunnelling calculations.

of the superconducting order parameter, variation of the chemical potential
causes oscillations with alternating superconducting (superfluid) and normal

weakly, the properties of the system depend monotonically on $n_0$. Lowering

where all the spins are fully polarized in two-dimensional planes as in the
experimental indications, and investigate their ground-state properties by
quantum Monte Carlo method. At half filling where the number of $e_{g}$
electron is one per site on average, the Coulomb interaction opens a Mott gap
and induces a staggered orbital ordering. The opening of the Mott gap is,
however, substantially slower than the mean-field results if the Jahn-Teller
coupling is absent. The synergy between the strong correlation and the
Jahn-Teller coupling largely enhances the Mott gap amplitude and reproduces
realistic amplitudes and stabilization energy of the Jahn-Teller distortion.
Upon doping, the orbital ordering stabilized by the Coulomb interaction is
destroyed immediately. Toward the metal-insulator transition, the short-ranged
orbital correlation is critically enhanced in metals, which should be related
to strong incoherence of charge dynamics observed in experiments. Our model,
moreover, exhibits a uniform ordering of $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital in a wide
region of doping in agreement with experimental indications.

mechanics (SUSYQM) admits a formulation in terms of only one bosonic degree of
freedom. Such a construction, called the minimally bosonized SUSYQM, appeared
in the context of integrable systems and dynamical symmetries. We show that the
minimally bosonized SUSYQM can be obtained from Witten's SUSYQM by applying to
it a nonlocal unitary transformation with a subsequent reduction to one of the
eigenspaces of the total reflection operator. The transformation depends on the
parity operator, and the deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection,
intimately related to parabosons and parafermions, emerges here in a natural
way. It is shown that the minimally bosonized SUSYQM can also be understood as
supersymmetric two-fermion system. With this interpretation, the bosonization
construction is generalized to the case of N=1 supersymmetry in 2 dimensions.
The same special unitary transformation diagonalises the Hamiltonian operator
of the 2D massive free Dirac theory. The resulting Hamiltonian is not a square
root like in the Foldy-Wouthuysen case, but is linear in spatial derivative.
Subsequent reduction to `up' or `down' field component gives rise to a linear
differential equation with reflection whose `square' is the massive
Klein-Gordon equation. In the massless limit this becomes the self-dual Weyl
equation. The linear differential equation with reflection admits
generalizations to higher dimensions and can be consistently coupled to gauge
fields. The bosonized SUSYQM can also be generated applying the nonlocal
unitary transformation to the Dirac field in the background of a nonlinear
scalar field in a kink configuration.

studying biopolymers, but it is readily applicable only to molecules with tree
topologies, that is with no internal flexible rings. Common examples violating
this condition are prolines and loops closed by S-S bridges in proteins. The
most important such case, however, is nucleic acids because the flexibility of
the furanose rings always plays an essential role in conformational transitions
both in DNA and RNA. There are a few long-known theoretical approaches to this
problem, but, in practice, rings with fixed bond lengths are closed by adding
appropriate harmonic distance restraints, which is not always acceptable
especially in dynamics. This paper tries to overcome this handicap of ICMD and
proposes a rational strategy which results in practical numerical algorithms.
It gives a unified analytical treatment which shows that this problem is very
close to the difficulties encountered by the method of constraints in Cartesian
coordinate dynamics, and certain ideas of the latter appear helpful in the
context of ICMD. The method is affordable for large molecules and generally
applicable to all kinds of rings. A specific implementation for five-membered
rings is described and tested for a proline-rich polypeptide and a decamer DNA
duplex. In both cases conditions are found which make possible time steps
around 10 fsec in ICMD calculations.
