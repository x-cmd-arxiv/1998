two dimensions. For both models, the linear resistance is nonzero at finite
temperatures and the scaling analysis of the nonlinear resistivity is
consistent with a phase transition at T=0 temperature characterized by a
diverging correlation length $\xi \propto T^{-\nu_{T}}$ and thermal critical
exponent $\nu_{T}$. The values of $\nu_{T}$, however, are found to be different
for the chiral and gauge glass models, suggesting different universality
classes, in contrast to the result obtained recently in three dimensions.

gauge in the context of the dual superconductor picture for confinement. In the
abelian gauge, unit-charge magnetic monopoles appear, but multi-charge
monopoles do not in general cases. The appearance of the monopole is studied
using the gauge-connection formalism in relation to the SU($N_c$) singular
gauge transformation. The relevant role of off-diagonal gluons is found for the
appearance of monopoles in the abelian gauge in QCD. We study the gluon-field
properties around the monopole in the MA gauge in terms of the action density
using the lattice QCD. The monopole provides infinitely large field
fluctuations in the abelian sector. In the MA gauge, off-diagonal gluons are
strongly suppressed but largely remain around the monopole, which indicates the
effective size and the structure of monopoles. We find the large cancellation
between the abelian part and the off-diagonal part of the action density around
the monopole in the MA gauge. Owing to this cancellation, the monopole can
appear in QCD without large cost of the QCD action. Finally, we generalize the
framework of the abelian projection, {\it i.e.} the extraction of the abelian
gauge manifold from QCD, by introducing the `gluonic Higgs field' $\vec
\phi_D[A_\mu(x)]$ defined from the ${\rm SU}(N_c)$ covariant derivative $\hat
D_\mu$. By way of $\vec \phi_D[A_\mu(x)]$, the maximally abelian projection can
be performed in the gauge-covariant manner without the notion of gauge fixing
in principle.

  Typographical corrections",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Matter waves were discovered in the early 20th century from their wavelength,
predicted by DeBroglie, Planck's constant divided by the particle's momentum,
that is, lmw = h/mv. But, the failure to obtain a reasonable theory for the
matter wave frequency resulted somewhat in loss of further interest.
  It was expected that the frequency of the matter wave should correspond to
the particle kinetic energy, that is, fmw = 1/2mv^2/h but the resulting
velocity of the matter of the particle, v = fmw x lmw, is that the matter wave
moves at one half the speed of the particle, obviously absurd as the particle
and its wave must move together.
  If relativistic mass is used (as it should in any case) the problem remains,
the same mass appearing in numerator and denominator and canceling. It is no
help to hypothesize that the total energy, not just the kinetic energy, yields
the matter wave. That attributes a matter wave to a particle at rest. It also
gives the resulting velocity as c^2/v, the wave racing ahead of its particle.
  A reinterpretation of Einstein's derivation of relativistic kinetic energy
(which produced his famous E = mc^2) leads to a valid matter wave frequency and
a new understanding of particle kinetics and of the atom's stable orbits.
