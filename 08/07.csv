results in a substantially more compact core structure out to the shock, the
shock radius at stagnation being reduced by a factor of 2. The inflow speed of
material behind the shock is also increased by a factor of 2 throughout most of
the evolution. We have developed a code for general relativistic multigroup
flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) in static spacetimes and compared the
steady-state neutrino distributions for selected time slices of post-bounce
models with those computed with Newtonian MGFLD. The GR transport calculations
show the expected reductions in neutrino luminosities and rms energies from
redshift and curvature effects. Although the effects of GR on the hydrodynamics

configurations are sufficiently different that no firm conclusions can be
drawn, except that simulations of core collapse supernovae using Newtonian

present power-law photon indices for 115 sources, which were either determined
with a hardness ratio technique or from direct fits to pointed PSPC data. For
quasars, the soft X-ray photon index is correlated with redshift and with radio
spectral index. Webster et al. (1995) discovered many sources with unusually
red optical continua among the quasars of this sample and interpreted this
result in terms of extinction by dust. Although the X-ray spectra in general do
not show excess absorption, we find that low-redshift optically red quasars
have significantly lower soft X-ray luminosities on average than objects with
blue optical continua. The difference disappears for higher redshifts, as is
expected for intrinsic absorption by cold gas associated with the dust.
Alternative explanations are briefly discussed. We conclude, however, that dust

continua.

warm gas reservoir of the group in process of fueling H90b with gas. H90c and d
have experienced past interaction with gas exchange. The gas acquired by H90c
has already settled and relaxed but the effects of the interaction can still be
visible in the morphology of the two galaxies and their stellar kinematics.
This process will possibly result in a major merger.

homogeneous state occurs at critical energy U_c. A theoretical analysis within
the canonical ensemble identifies such a transition as first order. But
microcanonical simulations reveal a negative specific heat regime near $U_c$.
The dynamical behaviour of the system is affected by this transition : below
U_c anomalous diffusion is observed, while for U > U_c the motion of the

like a noise source of variance O(1/N), that restores normal diffusion on a
time scale diverging with N. As a consequence, the asymptotic diffusion
coefficient will also diverge algebraically with N and superdiffusion will be
observable at any time in the limit N \to \infty. A Lyapunov analysis reveals
that for U > U_c the maximal exponent \lambda decreases proportionally to
N^{-1/3} and vanishes in the mean-field limit. For sufficiently small energy,
in spite of a clear non ergodicity of the system, a common scaling law \lambda

excited magneto-plasma due to bare Coulomb potential scattering, because

time-resolved and time-integrated four-wave mixing (FWM) signals are calculated
by taking into account three Landau subbands in both the valance and the

quantum beats mainly with twice the cyclotron frequency. Contrary to general
expectations, we find no pronounced slowing down of the dephasing with
increasing magnetic field. On the contrary, one obtains a decreasing dephasing
time because of the increase of the Coulomb matrix elements and the number of
states in a given Landau subband. In the situation when the loss of scattering
channels exceeds these increasing effects, one gets a slight increase at the
dephasing time. However, details of the strongly modulated scattering kinetics
depend sensitively on the detuning, the plasma density, and the spectral pulse

what extent it may be realized in a specific model. We comment initially on the
simplified two-generation case, emphasizing that large mixing is not
incompatible with a large hierarchy of mass eigenvalues. We also emphasize that
renormalization-group effects may amplify neutrino mixing, presenting
semi-analytic expressions for estimating this amplification. Several examples
are then given of three-family neutrino mass textures which may also
accommodate the persistent solar neutrino deficit, with different assumptions
for the neutrino Dirac mass matrices. We comment on a few features of neutrino
mass textures arising in models with a U(1) flavour symmetry. Finally, we
discuss the possible pattern of neutrino masses in a `realistic' flipped SU(5)
model derived from string theory, illustrating how a desirable pattern of
mixing may emerge. Both small- or large-angle MSW solutions are possible,
whilst a hierarchy of neutrino masses appears more natural than
near-degeneracy. This model contains some unanticipated features that may also
be relevant in other models: the neutrino Dirac matrices may not be related
closely to the quark mass matrices, and the heavy Majorana states may include
extra gauge-singlet fields.

  conclusion","Eur.Phys.J.C16:701-705,2000","10.1007/s100520000397",,"hep-ph",,"  The singular seesaw mechanism can naturally explain the atmospheric neutrino
deficit by the maximal oscillation between $\nu_{\mu_L}$ and $\nu_{\mu_R}$.
This mechanism can also induce three different scales of neutrino mass squared
differences, which can explain the neutrino deficits of three independent
experiments (solar, atmospheric, and LSND) by neutrino oscillations. In this
paper we show that the realistic mixing angles among neutrinos can be obtained
by introducing the hierarchy in the Dirac neutrino mass. In the case where
Majorana neutrino mass matrix has rank 2, the solar neutrino deficit is
explained by the vacuum oscillation between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\tau$. We also
consider the case where Majorana neutrino mass matrix has rank 1. In this case,
the mater enhanced Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein solar neutrino solution is
prefered as the solution of the solar neutrino deficit.

soft parton dynamics in ultrarelativistic collisions of nuclei. The emission of
gluons from the initially coherent parton configurations of the colliding
nuclei and low-$p_t$ color coherence effects are treated in the framework of a
Yang-Mills transport equation on a coupled lattice-particle system. A collision
term is added to the transport equation to account for the remaining
intermediate and high-$p_t$ interactions in an infrared finite manner.

electromagnetic meson and baryon measured mass splittings, and the observed
isospin violating ($\Delta I=1$) decay $\omega \to \pi^+\pi^-$. The hadronic
realization of this tadpole mechanism lies in the $I = 1$ $a_0$ scalar meson.
We show that measured hadronic and two-photon widths of the $a_0$ meson, with

electroproduction of baryon resonances off the deuteron. In particular, the

kinematic situations in which their hadronic reinteraction is the dominant
contribution. Specifically, we study the reaction $d(e,e'S_{11})N$ at $Q^2\ge 1

predominantly with the spectator nucleon. A comparison of constituent quark
model and effective chiral Lagrangian calculations of the $S_{11}$ shows
substantial sensitivity to the structure of the produced resonance.

really belong to physics at all but to elementary probability theory. Given a
joint probability distribution J on a set of random variables containing x and
y, define a link between x and y to be the condition x=y on J. Define the {\it
state} D of a link x=y as the joint probability distribution matrix on x and y
without the link. The two core laws of quantum mechanics are the Born
probability rule, and the unitary dynamical law whose best known form is the
Schrodinger's equation. Von Neumann formulated these two laws in the language
of Hilbert space as prob(P) = trace(PD) and D'T = TD respectively, where P is a
projection, D and D' are (von Neumann) density matrices, and T is a unitary
transformation. We'll see that if we regard link states as density matrices,
the algebraic forms of these two core laws occur as completely general theorems
about links. When we extend probability theory by allowing cases to count
negatively, we find that the Hilbert space framework of quantum mechanics
proper emerges from the assumption that all D's are symmetrical in rows and
columns. On the other hand, Markovian systems emerge when we assume that one of
every linked variable pair has a uniform probability distribution. By
representing quantum and Markovian structure in this way, we see clearly both
how they differ, and also how they can coexist in natural harmony with each
other, as they must in quantum measurement, which we'll examine in some detail.
Looking beyond quantum mechanics, we see how both structures have their special
places in a much larger continuum of formal systems that we have yet to look
for in nature.

framework of the nonstandard synchronization scheme for clocks. Such a
synchronization preserves Poincar{\'e} covariance but (at least formally)
distinguishes an inertial frame. This enables to avoid the problem of a
noncausal transmision of information related to breaking of the Bell's
inequalities in QM. Our analysis has been focused mainly on the problem of
existence of a proper position operator for massive particles. We have proved
that in our framework such an operator exists for particles with arbitrary
spin. It fulfills all the requirements: it is Hermitean and covariant, it has
commuting components and moreover its eigenvectors (localised states) are also
covariant. We have found the explicit form of the position operator and have
demonstrated that in the preferred frame our operator coincides with the
Newton--Wigner one. We have also defined a covariant spin operator and have
constructed an invariant spin square operator. Moreover, full algebra of
observables consisting of position operators, fourmomentum operators and spin
operators is manifestly Poincar\'e covariant in this framework. Our results
support expectations of other authors (Bell, Eberhard) that a consistent
formulation of quantum mechanics demands existence of a preferred frame.
