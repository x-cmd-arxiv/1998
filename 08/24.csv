To be published in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/306813",,"astro-ph",,"  Are microlensing searches likely to discover planets that harbor life? Given
our present state of knowledge, this is a difficult question to answer. We
therefore begin by asking a more narrowly focused question: are conditions on
planets discovered via microlensing likely to be similar to those we experience
on Earth? In this paper I link the microlensing observations to the well-known
""Goldilocks Problem"" (conditions on the Earth-like planets need to be ""just
right""), to find that Earth-like planets discovered via microlensing are likely
to be orbiting stars more luminous than the sun. This means that light from the
planetary system's central star may contribute a significant fraction of the
baseline flux relative to the star that is lensed. Such blending of light from
the lens with light from the lensed source can, in principle, limit our ability
to detect these events. This turns out not to be a significant problem,
however. A second consequence of blending is the opportunity to determine the
spectral type of the lensed spectral type of the lensed star. This
circumstance, plus the possibility that finite-source-size effects are
important, implies that some meaningful follow-up observations are likely to be
possible for a subset Earth-like planets discovered via microlensing. In
addition, calculations indicate that reasonable requirements on the planet's
density and surface gravity imply that the mass of Earth-like planets is likely
to be within a factor of $\sim 15$ of an Earth mass.

predicts that the luminosities of these features will depend on the metallicity

age RGB-bumps and AGB-bumps in the V(HB-Bump)--[Fe/H] diagram, which shows the
brightness difference between the bump and the HB as a function of metallicity.
In order to test the predictions, we identify giant branch bumps in new Hubble
Space Telescope color-magnitude diagrams for 8 SMC clusters. First, we conclude
that the SMC cluster bumps are RGB-bumps. The data for clusters younger than ~6
Gyr are in fair agreement the relative age dependent luminosities of the HB and
RGB-bump. The V(HB-Bump)--[Fe/H] data for clusters older then ~6 Gyr
demonstrate a less satisfactory agreement with our calculations. We conclude
that ~6 Gyr is a lower bound to the age of clusters for which the Galactic
globular cluster, age independent V(HB-Bump)--[Fe/H] calibration is valid.
Application of the V(HB-bump)--[Fe/H] diagram to stellar population studies is

highly intermittently as blobs. The high specific angular momentum gas blobs
bounce at the centrifugal barrier and create shock waves. The low specific
angular momentum gas is heated at the shock fronts and escapes along the
rotation axis. The outgoing gas evolves into pressure-driven jets. Jet
acceleration lasts until the shock waves fade out. The total amount of the mass
ejection is about 1-11 % of the mass of the blobs. The jet mass increases when
the gas blobs are more massive or have larger specific angular momentum. We get

investigate the atomic structure of four ordered coadsorbate phases of carbon
monoxide and oxygen on Ru(0001). All of the structures have a (2x2) periodicity
with differing concentrations of CO molecules and O atoms. For two of these

been performed and the agreement between our DFT- and the LEED-determined

in this model explicit calculations of S-matrix elements between quark states,

the Standard Model (SM) in its full parameter space is investigated up to the
scale of the gauge singularity. The critical Higgs masses bordering the strong
coupling, unstable and the safe regions are explicitly found. Restrictions on
the Higgs boson mass as a function of a cutoff scale are obtained from the
stability of the electroweak vacuum and from the absence of the strong coupling
both in the Higgs and Yukawa sectors. The cutoff being equal to the Plank scale
requires the Higgs mass to be M=(161.3+-20.6)+4-10 GeV and M>=140.7+-10 GeV,
where the M corridor is the theoretical one and the errors are due to the top
mass uncertainty.
  The SM two-loop beta-functions are generalized to the massive neutrino case.
Modification of the two-loop global profile of the SM extended by one new
chiral family is studied, and bounds on the masses of the family are found. The
requirement of self-consistency of the perturbative SM as an underlying theory
up to the Planck or GUT scale excludes the fourth chiral family with the mass
up to 250 GeV depending on the Higgs mass and the cutoff scale. Under precision
experiment restriction M<=200 GeV, the fourth chiral family, taken alone, is
excluded. Nevertheless a pair of the chiral families constituting the
vector-like one could still exist.

additional matter fermions, in all representations of (the holomorphic part of)
the isometry group. This can be used to eliminate unwanted gamma_5 anomalies,
in particular for the U(1) symmetry arising from the complex structure of the
target space. A consistent gauging of this isometry group, or any of its
subgroups, then becomes possible. When gauged in the presence of a chiral
scalar multiplet, the U(1) symmetry is broken spontaneously, generating a mass
for the U(1) vector multiplet via the supersymmetric Higgs effect. As an
example we discuss the case of the homogeneous coset space E6/SO(10) x U(1).
