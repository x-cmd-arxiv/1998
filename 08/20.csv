reliable are discussed in depth. These different techniques are used to
calibrate the absolute magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars. The various
calibrations fall into three groups. Main sequence fitting using Hipparcos
parallaxes, theoretical HB models and the RR Lyrae in the LMC all favor a
bright calibration, implying a `long' globular cluster distance scale. White
dwarf fitting and the astrometric distances yield a somewhat fainter RR Lyrae
calibration, while the statistical parallax solution yields faint RR Lyrae
stars implying a `short' distance scale to globular clusters. Various secondary
distance indicators discussed all favor the long distance scale. The `long' and
`short' distance scales differ by (0.31+/-0.16) mag. Averaging together all of
the different distance determinations yields Mv(RR) = (0.23+/-0.04)([Fe/H] +

also show that the asymptotic low energy normalization of the time-integrated

this general behavior is modified in more realistic situations and show that
diversity is then introduced in the properties of time-integrated GRB pulse

approximately the decay constant times the maximum peak energy of the pulse.

Although the spectral energy distributions at both epochs were quite similar,
the source exhibited two very distinct variability patterns that cannot be
easily reconciled with homogeneous, one-zone jet models. During the first epoch
the variability was almost achromatic in amplitude, with a time lag between
X-rays and UV of $\approx 3$ h, while during the second epoch the variability
amplitude increased as a function of wavelength, with the EUV flare peaking
$\approx 1$ day after the X-ray flare. We model the source using a
time-dependent inhomogeneous accelerating jet model. e reproduce the general
characteristics of the different variability signatures by assuming that plasma
disturbances with different physical properties propagate downstream in an
underlying jet characterized by the same set of physical parameters at both
epochs. A time delay of $\approx$ 1 day between the hardening of the UV
spectral index and the UV flux, present at both epochs, is modeled with
stochastic fluctuations in the particle acceleration manifested through small
variations of the maximum energy of the injected electrons. We predict that
similar time delays will be present in future observations, even in the absence
of strong variability events. We stress the importance of observations at
neighboring frequencies as a diagnostic tool for the structure of the quiescent

lower frequencies the spectrum is power-suppressed and well below the COBE

behavior of the topological susceptibility depends upon the order of the
deconfining phase transition. The most interesting possibility is if the
deconfining transition, at $T=T_d$, is of second order. Then we argue that
Witten's relation implies that the topological susceptibility vanishes in a
calculable fashion at $T_d$. As noted by Witten, this implies that for
sufficiently light quark masses, metastable states which act like regions of
nonzero $\theta$ --- parity odd bubbles --- can arise at temperatures just
below $T_d$. Experimentally, parity odd bubbles have dramatic signatures: the
$\eta'$ meson, and especially the $\eta$ meson, become light, and are copiously
produced. Further, in parity odd bubbles, processes which are normally
forbidden, such as $\eta \to \pi^0 \pi^0$, are allowed. The most direct way to
detect parity violation is by measuring a parity odd global asymmetry for
charged pions, which we define.

in the context of an infinite family of right adjoint constructions for

algebra su_q(2) on a real two-dimensional sphere, or a real plane, and
constructed a basis for its representations in terms of q-special functions,
which can be expressed in terms of q-Vilenkin functions, and are related to
little q-Jacobi functions, q-spherical functions, and q-Legendre polynomials.
In their study, the values of q were implicitly restricted to $q \in R^+$. In
the present paper, we extend their work to the case of generic values of $q \in
S^1$ (i.e., q values different from a root of unity). In addition, we unitarize
the representations for both types of q values, $q \in R^+$ and generic $q \in
S^1$, by determining some appropriate scalar products. From the latter, we
deduce the orthonormality relations satisfied by the q-Vilenkin functions.

quantum nucleation of quark matter is examined at low temperatures relevant to
neutron star cores. We calculate the equation of state and the composition of
matter before and after deconfinement by using a relativistic mean-field theory
and an MIT bag model, respectively; the case in which hyperons are present in
the hadronic system is considered, together with the case of the system without
hyperons. We find that strangeness contained in hyperons acts to reduce a
density jump at deconfinement as well as a lepton fraction in the hadronic
phase. As a result of these reductions, a quark matter droplet being in a
virtual or real state has its effective mass lightened and its electric charge
diminished into nearly zero. The Coulomb screening of leptons on the droplet
charge, which has significance to the droplet growth after nucleation in the
absence of hyperons, is thus shown to be of little consequence. If the
effective droplet mass is small enough to become comparable to the height of
the potential barrier, the effect of relativity brings about an exponential
increase in the rate of droplet formation via quantum tunneling, whereas the
role played by energy dissipation in decelerating the droplet formation,
dominant for matter without hyperons, becomes of less importance. For matter
with and without hyperons, we estimate the overpressure needed to form the
first droplet in the star during the compression due to stellar spin-down or
mass accretion from a companion star. The temperature at which a crossover from
the quantum nucleation to the Arrhenius-type thermal nucleation takes place is
shown to be large compared with the temperature of matter in the core.

depletion, as functions of pump and signal confocal parameters, for kI/kP=0.33

a function of the ratio of pump power to threshold power agrees with the
plane-wave prediction to within 5%, for a wide range of focusing conditions.
The observed trends are explained as resulting from intensity and phase
dependent mechanisms.

^4He trimer is studied when the force of the interatomic interaction is
changed. It is shown that these levels arise from virtual levels which are in
turn formed from (quasi)resonances settled on the real axis. The resonances
including virtual levels are calculated by the method based on the solution of
the boundary value problem, at complex energies, for the Faddeev differential
equations describing the scattering processes (2+1\to 2+1; 1+1+1). All the
calculations are performed with the known interatomic Aziz He-He potential
HFD-B. A very strong repulsive component of this potential at short distances
between helium atoms is approximated by a hard core. A special attention is
paid to the substantiation of the method used for computing resonances and to
the investigation of its applicability range.
