first two moments of the velocity distribution of the Hyades cluster namely,
its bulk space velocity and the velocity dispersion tensor. We predict the
parallaxes of Hyades cluster members using the common cluster space velocity
derived from the statistical parallax method and their individual Hipparcos
proper motions. We show that the parallaxes determined in this manner (pi_pm)
are consistent at the 1-sigma level with the parallaxes (pi_orb) of three
Hyades spectroscopic binary systems with orbital solutions. We find that
<(pi_pm - pi_orb)> = 0.52 +- 0.47 mas, where the error is dominated by the
errors in the orbital parallaxes. A reduction in this error would allow a test
of the systematic errors in the Hipparcos parallaxes at the 0.3 mas level. If
the Hyades distance scale is fixed by Hipparcos parallaxes, then its bulk
velocity in equatorial coordinates is (Vx,Vy,Vz) = (-5.70 +- 0.20, 45.62 +-

decays on a timescale tau > 0.65 s. In particular, it requires that a fluence
of F = 0.031 be provided by a neutrino flux with tau < 0.84 s. Such a fluence
may be responsible for the production of the solar r-process abundances at A =
124-126 (Qian et al. 1997; Haxton et al. 1997). Our results are based on the
assumption that only the stable nuclei implanted into the diamonds are retained
while the radioactive ones are lost from the diamonds upon decay after
implantation (Ott 1996). We consider that the nanodiamonds are condensed in an
environment with C/O > 1 in the expanding supernova debris or from the exterior
H envelope. The implantation of nuclei would have occurred 10**4-10**6 s after
r-process freeze-out. This time interval may be marginally sufficient to permit
adequate cooling upon expansion for the formation of diamond grains. The
mechanisms of preferential retention/loss of the implanted nuclei are not well

the observed Tully-Fisher (TF) relations in various photometric bands. This
paper examines the influence of self-regulation mechanisms including supernova
feedback on galaxy luminosities and the TF relation in three cosmological
scenarios (CDM, \Lambda CDM and BSI (broken scale invariance)). The galaxy
catalogs derived from our hydrodynamical simulations lead to an acceptably
small scatter in the theoretical TF relation amounting to \Delta M =0.2-0.4 in
the I band, and increasing by 0.1 magnitude from the I-band to the B-band. Our
results give strong evidence that the tightness of the TF relation cannot be
attributed to supernova feedback alone. However, although eliminating supernova
feedback hardly affects the scatter, it does influence the slope of the TF
relation quite sensitively. With supernova feedback, L \propto V_c^{3-3.5}
(depending on the strength of supernova feedback). Without it, L \propto
V_c^{2} as predicted by the virial theorem with constant M/L.
  The luminosity functions in the B and K bands are quite sensitive to
supernova feedback at the faint end studied here. We find that the faint end of
the B-band luminosity function (-18 \leq M_B \leq -15) has a slope that is
steeper than the Stromlo-APM estimate, but in rough agreement with the recent

and (ii) allows straightforward application to general tight-binding
Hamiltonians (spd in the present work). The method is applied to studies of
conductance and giant magnetoresistance (GMR) of magnetic multilayers in CPP
(current perpendicular to planes) geometry in the limit of large coherence
length. The magnetic materials considered are Co and Ni, with various
non-magnetic materials from the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal series.
Realistic tight-binding models for them have been constructed with the use of
density functional calculations. We have identified three qualitatively
different cases which depend on whether or not the bands (densities of states)
of a non-magnetic metal (i) form an almost perfect match with one of spin
sub-bands of the magnetic metal (as in Cu/Co spin valves); (ii) have almost
pure sp character at the Fermi level (e.g. Ag); (iii) have almost pure d
character at the Fermi energy (e.g. Pd, Pt). The key parameters which give rise
to a large GMR ratio turn out to be (i) a strong spin polarization of the
magnetic metal, (ii) a large energy offset between the conduction band of the
non-magnetic metal and one of spin sub-bands of the magnetic metal, and (iii)
strong interband scattering in one of spin sub-bands of a magnetic metal. The
present results show that GMR oscillates with variation of the thickness of
either non-magnetic or magnetic layers, as observed experimentally.

high temperature superconductivity. Short-range spin correlations in ladders
have been predicted to lead to formation of hole pairs favorable for
superconductivity, once enough holes are introduced onto the ladders by doping.
Indeed, superconductivity has been discovered in the two-leg ladder compound

transport in the non-superconducting state of (Sr,Ca)$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$
shares three distinct regimes in common with high-temperature superconductors,

resistivity increases as the logarithm of the temperature. These observations
suggest that the logarithmic divergence arises from a new localization
mechanism common to the ladder compounds and the high-temperature
superconductors, which may arise from nearly one-dimensional charge transport
in the presence of a spin gap.

through spacelike surfaces. However, a generalization of this formulation is
needed for field theory in spacetimes not foliable by spacelike surfaces, or in
quantum gravity where geometry is not definite but a quantum variable. In
particular, a generalization of usual quantum theory is needed for field theory
in the spacetimes that model the process of black hole evaporation. This paper
discusses a spacetime generalization of usual quantum theory that is applicable
to evaporating black hole spacetimes. In this generalization, information is
not lost in the process of evaporation. Rather, complete information is
distributed about four-dimensional spacetime. Black hole evaporation is thus
not in conflict with the principles of quantum theory when suitably generally
stated. (Talk presented at the 49th Yamada Conference: Black Holes and High

quasiclassical nature of $X$ is assumed to have come about as a result of
decoherence. The state of the quantum subsystem evolves according to the
stochastic non-linear Schr\""odinger equation of a continuously measured system,
and the classical system couples to a stochastic c-number $\x (t)$ representing
the imprecisely measured value of $x$. The theory gives intuitively sensible
results even when the quantum system starts out in a superposition of
well-separated localized states. The second approach involves a derivation of
an effective theory from the underlying quantum theory of the combined
quasiclassical--quantum system, and uses the decoherent histories approach to
quantum theory.

  of the 22nd Nashiagoli Summer College",,,"UCLA/98/TEP/24","hep-ph",,"  In these lectures I examine some of the principal issues in cosmology from a
particle physics point of view. I begin with nucleosynthesis and show how the
primordial abundance of the light elements can help fix the number of (light)
neutrino species and determine the ratio $\eta$ of baryons to photon in the
universe now. The value of $\eta$ obtained highlights two of the big open
problems of cosmology: the presence of dark matter and the need for
baryogenesis. After discussing the distinction between hot and cold dark
matter, I examine the constraints on, and prospect for, neutrinos as hot dark
matter candidates. I show next that supersymmetry provides a variety of
possibilities for dark matter, with neutralinos being excellent candidates for
cold dark matter and gravitinos, in some scenarios, possibly providing some
form of warm dark matter. After discussing axions as another cold dark matter
candidate, I provide some perspectives on the nature of dark matter before
turning to baryogenesis. Here I begin by outlining the Sakharov conditions for
baryogenesis before examining the issues and challenges of producing a, large
enough, baryon asymmetry at the GUT scale. I end my lectures by discussing the
Kuzmin-Rubakov-Shaposhnikov mechanism and issues associated with electrical
baryogenesis. In particular, I emphasize the implications that generating the
baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale has for present-day particle physics.

the effectively three-dimensional sector of the soft modes. The separation
between hard and soft modes is achieved by the effective field theory method of
Braaten and Nieto. One- and two-loop gap equations for the screening mass are
used to resum higher order effects in the soft sector. The proposed method is
similar to the screened perturbation theory of Karsch, Patkos, and Petreczky
albeit avoiding the difficulty of solving gap equations in the full
four-dimensional theory. Since gap equations are only used in the
three-dimensional effective theory the tedious evaluation of Matsubara sums is
not necessary. This simplification makes it possible to go beyond the one-loop
gap equation. The large N as well as the finite N case are discussed.

phenomena are worth studying on at least two accounts. First, the formation of
solitary waves may lead to droplet formation that causes significant beam halo
to develop. Secondly, a variety of nonlinear processes are likely involved in
the normal saturation of unstable oscillations, leading to the possibility that
low-level, but potentially broadband fluctuation spectra may develop. Both
features carry indirectly the signature of the machine impedance. In this work
we review a number of observations of nonlinear longitudinal waves made in
Fermilab accelerators, and make a first attempt to develop appropriate
theoretical models to explain these observations.

doubly-charged nonstoichiometric (MgO)nMg2+ (n=1-29) cluster ions. We consider
a large number of isomers with full relaxations of the geometries, and add the
correlation correction to the Hartree-Fock energies for all cluster sizes. The
polarization contribution is included at a semiempirical level also for all
cluster sizes. Comparison is made with theoretical results for neutral (MgO)n
clusters and singly-charged alkali-halide cluster ions. Our method is also
compared to phenomenological pair potential models in order to asses their
reliability for calculations on small ionic systems. The large
coordination-dependent polarizabilities of oxide anions favor the formation of
surface sites, and thus bulklike structures begin to dominate only after n=24.
The relative stabilities of the cluster ions against evaporation of a MgO
molecule show variations that are in excellent agreement with the experimental
abundance spectra.

  -on quantum mutual entropy and entanglement-","10 pages, Latex2e",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The study of mutual entropy (information) and capacity in classica l system
was extensively done after Shannon by several authors like Kolmogor ov and
Gelfand. In quantum systems, there have been several definitions of t he mutual
entropy for classical input and quantum output. In 1983, the autho r defined
the fully quantum mechanical mutual entropy by means of the relati ve entropy
of Umegaki, and it has been used to compute the capacity of quant um channel
for quantum communication process; quantum input-quantum output.
  Recently, a correlated state in quantum syatems, so-called quantum entangled
state or quantum entanglement, are used to study quntum information, in part
icular, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography.
  In this paper, we mainly discuss three things below: (1) We point out the di
fference between the capacity of quantum channel and that of classical-quant
um-classical channel. (2) So far the entangled state is merely defined as a
non-separable state, we give a wider definition of the entangled state and c
lassify the entangled states into three categories. (3) The quantum mutual e
ntropy for an entangled state is discussed. The above (2) and (3) are a join t
work with Belavkin.

which then quantum state tomography is performed using balanced homodyne
detection. This technique provides full information about the signal state. We
also discuss the influence of the measurement of the meter on the signal field.
