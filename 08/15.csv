the early Universe and their effect on the large scale structure of the
present-day Universe are discussed. The first of them is the possibility of
fast phase transitions in physical fields other than an inflaton scalar field
during inflation and nor far from the end of it. This results in the appearance
of specific features in the inflaton effective potential which, in turn, lead
to the generation of localized spikes in the primordial perturbation spectrum.
At present, there seems to exist one scale in the spectrum, $k=0.05h$
Mpc$^{-1}$, around which we might see something of this type. The second one is
the possibility that we are living at the beginning of a new inflation-like era
now. Then observations of clustering of high-redshift objects can provide
information sufficient for the unambiguous determination of the effective
potential of a corresponding present inflaton scalar field.

a significant expansion of the star. For high accretion rates, hot bottom

Searle-Zinn fragment in the outer halo of the Galaxy is discussed. Arguments in
favor of this hypothesis are: (1) The luminosity distribution of globular
clusters in both Sagittarius and in the outer halo (Rgc > 80 kpc), appear to be
bimodal with peaks near MV ~ -5 and MV ~ -10, and (2) the globular clusters in
both Sgr, and in the outer halo, have a significantly larger age spread than do
the globulars in the inner halo of the Galaxy. However, a counter argument is
that only one of the four globulars associated with Sgr has the large
half-light diameter that is diagnostic of outer halo clusters. The absence of
globular clusters from all Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies fainter than
MV = -12 shows that their specific globular cluster frequency must be lower
than it is in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. This result suggests that Fornax may
have had an unusual evolutionary history.

coherent scales. We show that the formation of dense and turbulent shells of
matter, in the multiple explosion scenario of Miranda and Opher (1996, 1997)
for the formation of the large-scale structures of the Universe, can naturally
act as a seed for the generation of a magnetic field. During the collapse and
explosion of Population III objects, a temperature gradient not parallel to a
density gradient can naturally be established, producing a seed magnetic field
through the Biermann battery mechanism. We show that seed magnetic fields $\sim
10^{-12}-10^{-14}G$ can be produced in this multiple explosion scenario on
scales of the order of clusters of galaxies (with coherence length $L\sim

not necessarily commuting entries was introduced recently by I.Gelfand and the
second author. The ordinary determinant of a matrix with commuting entries can

noticed by a number of authors that such well-known noncommutative determinants

generating matrix of the quantum group U_h(gl_n) and the Yangian Y(gl_n) can be
expressed as products of commuting quasiminors.

Hopf algebras given by the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan type relations -- the
twisted quantum groups. Such quantum groups arise when Belavin-Drinfeld
classical r-matrices are quantized. Our main result is that the quantum

protons, all measured in our spectrometer, increases with system size and is
consistent with the buildup of collective flow for larger systems. The target
dependence of both the yields and inverse slopes is stronger for the sulphur
beam suggesting the increased importance of secondary rescattering for SA
reactions. The rapidity density, dN/dy, of both K+ and K- increases more
rapidly with system size than for pi+ in a similar rapidity region. This trend
continues with increasing centrality, and according to RQMD, it is caused by
secondary reactions between mesons and baryons. The K-/K+ ratio falls with
increasing system size but more slowly than the pbar/p ratio. The pi-/pi+ ratio
is close to unity for all systems. From pBe to SPb the K+/p ratio decreases
while K-/pbar increases and ({K+*K-}/{p*pbar})**1/2 stays constant. These data
