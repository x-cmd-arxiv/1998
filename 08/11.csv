curve of the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15 originates from matter spiralling
into a Schwarzschild black hole, contrary to previous claims that the black
hole may be spinning rapidly (Iwasawa et al 1996; Dabrowski et al 1997). Here
we calculate in detail the X-ray spectrum produced by their model using the
full reflected continuum emission, including absorption features. This
calculation takes into account the doppler and relativistic effects. For the
range of parameters we consider, we find that the spectrum should show a large
photoelectric absorption edge of iron, which is not seen in the data. The
absorption edge is a consequence of the line emitting matter within the
innermost stable orbit being highly ionized, and is largely independent of the
parameters chosen for their model. If we restrict our attention to the 3-10 keV
band we may effectively remove this absorption edge by fitting a steeper power
law, but this results in a significant underprediction of the 0.4-0.5 keV flux.
We conclude that the data on MCG-6-30-15 are more consistent with the Kerr than
the Schwarzschild model.

improved by a factor of 2 for baseline data points, and by a factor of 2.5
during magnification. The largest improvement was found for the OGLE #5 event,
where we get an accuracy 7.5 times better than with DoPHOT. Despite some
defects in the old CCD used during the OGLE I experiment we obtain most of the
time errors that are only 30 % to 40 % in excess of the photon noise. Previous
experiment showed that with modern CCD chips (OGLE II), residuals much closer
to the photon noise were obtained. The better photometric quality enabled us to
find a low amplitude, long term variability in the OGLE #12 and OGLE #11
baseline magnitude. We also found that the shape of the OGLE #14 candidate
light curve is fairly inconsistent with microlensing of a point source by a
point lens. A dramatic change in the light curve of the OGLE #9 candidate was
also found, which indicates that very large biases can be present in data
processed with DoPHOT. To conclude we made a detailed analysis of the blending

Gaussian with <tau_I-tau_H>=0.6 and sigma=0.27. For a homogenous dust
distribution and a Milky Way extinction curve, this corresponds to a face-on

biases and our analysis is subject to different systematics, the result is
consistent with existing case studies, indicating that <tau_V>~0.3 is generic
for late-type spirals near their half-light radii.

explained by neutrino oscillations and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect.
Since neither a flavor change, nor a terrestrial variation, nor a spectral
distortion of the $^8$B solar neutrino flux has been observed yet, the solar
neutrino problem does not provide conclusive evidence for neutrino properties

results from those predicted by the standard solar models may reflect the
approximate nature of of solar models and of our knowledge of nuclear reaction
rates, radiation transport and particle diffusion in dense stellar plasmas.
Only future observations of spectral distortions, or terrestrial modulation or
flavor change of solar neutrinos in solar neutrino experiments, such as
Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino and HELLAZ will be able to establish that

not an adequate measure for the anisotropy of neutrino emission. The neutrino
flux is generated inside the neutron star core and is transported through the
atmosphere at a constant luminosity, forcing the temperature gradient in the
atmosphere to adjust to the inflow of energy from below. Therefore, no emission
anisotropy is caused by a deformation of the neutrinosphere to lowest order. An

correlation time and in the presence of an imposed linear mean gradient. The
energy spectrum in the inertial range has the form $E(k)\propto
k^{1-\epsilon}$, and the correlation time at the wavenumber k scales as
$k^{-2+\eta}$. It is shown that, depending on the values of the exponents
$\epsilon$ and $\eta$, the model in the inertial range reveals various types of
scaling regimes associated with the infrared stable fixed points of the RG
equations: diffusive-type regimes for which the advection can be treated within
ordinary perturbation theory, and three nontrivial convection-type regimes for
which the correlation functions exhibit anomalous scaling behavior. Explicit
asymptotic expressions for the structure functions and other correlation
functions are obtained; they are represented by superpositions of power laws
with nonuniversal amplitudes and universal (independent of the anisotropy)
anomalous exponents, calculated to the first order in $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ in
any space dimension. For the first nontrivial regime the anomalous exponents
are the same as in the rapid-change version of the model; for the second they
are the same as in the model with time-independent (frozen) velocity field. In
these regimes, the anomalous exponents are universal in the sense that they
depend only on the exponents entering into the velocity correlator. For the
last regime the exponents are nonuniversal (they can depend also on the
amplitudes); however, the nonuniversality can reveal itself only in the second

understanding for the electronic conduction through quantum point contacts. Our
study involves the molecular-dynamics simulations to reveal the variation of
interlayer distances and atomic structure at the proximity of the contact that
evolves by the tip pressing toward the surface. The effects of the elastic
deformation on the electronic structure, state density at the Fermi level, and
crystal potential are analyzed by performing self-consistent-field
pseudopotential calculations within the local-density approximation. It is
found that the metallicity of graphite increases under the uniaxial compressive
strain perpendicular to the basal plane. The quantum point contact is modeled
by a constriction with a realistic potential. The conductance is calculated by
representing the current transporting states in Laue representation, and the
variation of conductance with the evolution of contact is explained by taking
the characteristic features of graphite into account. It is shown that the
sequential puncturing of the layers characterizes the conductance.

circle arcs of small angular opening, by minimising a true Chi2 expression. The

remove background photons with a high efficiency. We thus show that, even when
the background is large, it is possible to perform an efficient PID by means of
a fit algorithm which finally provides all the circle parameters; these are
connected with the charged track direction and its Cerenkov angle. It is shown
that background effects can be dealt without spoiling significantly the

results over four different realizations of the random lattices. We compare
both types of triangulations quantitatively and investigate how the difference
in the expectation value of the squared curvature, $R^2$, for fixed and random
triangulations depends on the lattice size and the surface area A. We try to
measure the string susceptibility exponents through finite-size scaling
analyses of the expectation value of an added $R^2$-interaction term, using two
conceptually quite different procedures. The approach, where an ultraviolet
cut-off is held fixed in the scaling limit, is found to be plagued with
inconsistencies, as has already previously been pointed out by us. In a
conceptually different approach, where the area A is held fixed, these problems
are not present. We find the string susceptibility exponent $\gamma_{str}'$ in
rough agreement with theoretical predictions for the sphere, whereas the
estimate for $\gamma_{str}$ appears to be too negative. However, our results
are hampered by the presence of severe finite-size corrections to scaling,
which lead to systematic uncertainties well above our statistical errors. We
feel that the present methods of estimating the string susceptibilities by
finite-size scaling studies are not accurate enough to serve as testing grounds
to decide about a success or failure of quantum Regge calculus.

Gray-Scott model and thus is expected to be applicable to a broad range of
reaction-diffusion systems.

  condensates","14 pages. Submitted to Phys. Rev. A",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We study the dynamics of the relative phase between two Bose-Einstein
condensates coupled via collisions and via a Josephson-like coupling. We derive
the equations of the motion for the relative phase and the relative number
operators from the second quantized Hamiltonian of the system using a quantum
field theoretical approach. We distinguish the cases in which the two
condensates are in the same trap or in two different traps and study the
influence of this difference on the first order correlation function of atomic
fields. In identical traps this function does not undergo dephasing. We
calculate the dephasing time for the case of different traps.

between quantum states, exemplifying the more general type of procedure we term
state separation. We obtain the maximum probability with which two equiprobable
quantum states can be separated by an arbitrary degree, and find that the
established bounds on the success probabilities for discrimination and cloning
are special cases of this general bound. The latter also gives the maximum
probability of successfully producing N exact copies of a quantum system whose
state is chosen secretly from a known pair, given M initial realisations of the
state, where N>M. We also discuss the relationship between this bound and that
on unambiguous state discrimination.
