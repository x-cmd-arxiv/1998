millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. The power density spectrum is
dominated by a strong band-limited noise component, which follows a power-law
with index 1.0-1.3 at high frequencies with a break that varies between 0.25
and 1.6 Hz, below which the spectrum is relatively flat. Superimposed on this,
a broad bump is present with a centroid frequency that varies well correlated
with the break frequency between 2.4 and 12.0 Hz. These characteristics are
very similar to what is commonly seen in other low-luminosity low-mass X-ray
binaries. Between 100 and 400 Hz a third broad noise component is present
similar to that recently reported in the low-luminosity low-mass X-ray binary
4U 1728-34 (Ford & van der Klis 1998). We find a similar high-frequency noise
component also in other low-luminosity neutron star systems. We conclude that
at any given epoch the rapid aperiodic X-ray variability of the millisecond
X-ray pulsar is indistinguishable from that of other low-luminosity neutron
star systems.
  However, contrary to what has been found in those sources the break frequency
of the band-limited noise does not have a strict correlation with mass
accretion rate. With decreasing mass accretion rate, the break frequency first
decreased, then increased again. This previously unobserved behavior could be
typical for the very low mass accretion rates we observe near the end of the
outburst of SAX J1808.4-3658, or it could be related to it being a pulsar.

substantially reduced by adopting more aggressive observational strategies. We

diagram of count rates, where the hard hardness F(13-40keV)/F(2-13keV) is
plotted against the soft hardness F(5-13keV)/F(2-5keV). The system runs one
cycle with periods ranging between 50 - 100 s for different observations, one
rotation in the 2-color diagram corresponding to the time between two
contiguous maxima in the light curve. We model this behaviour successfully with
the help of a self-consistent 2-phase thermal model where seed photons from an
optically thick classical disk are Comptonized in a hot spherical corona
surrounding the inner disk. In the model, changes of two parameters regulate
the paths in the 2-color diagram: the black body temperature (Tin) of the inner
disk and the Thomson optical depth multiplied by the electron temperature of
the hot phase (tau*Te). These parameters oscillate with time but with a
phase-shift between each other, causing the ring-shaped pattern. During the
observation studied in more detail (20402-01-30-00), the inner disk radius
varied with 97 s period between 20 - 35 km with an anticorrelation between the
coronal and the mass accretion rate through the disk, possibly indicating a
coupling between the disk and coronal accretion. During a typical cycle, the
inner disk radius rapidly shrinked and returned more slowly back to the
original larger value. In the rings we may see phenomena close to the black
hole horizon under near Eddington accretion rates.

obscured by late-time fallback. Although much of the late-time fallback is
quickly accreted via neutrino cooling, some material remains on the neutron
star, forming an atmosphere which slowly accretes through photon emission. In
this paper, we derive structure equations of the fallback atmosphere and
present results of one-dimensional simulations of that fallback. The atmosphere
remaining after neutrino cooling becomes unimportant (less than the Compton
Eddington limit) is only a fraction of the total mass accreted (10^-8 of the
accreted mass or 10^-9 solar masses.) Recombined iron dominates the opacity in
the outer regions leading to an opacity 1000-10,000 times higher than that of
electron scattering alone. The resultant photon emission of the remnant
atmosphere is limited to 1/1000th the Compton Eddington Luminosity. The
late-time evolution of this system leads to the formation of a photon-driven
wind from the accretion of the inner portion of the atmosphere, leaving, for
most cases, a bare neutron star on timescales shorter than a year. The
degenerate remnant of 1987a may not be a black hole. Instead, the fallback
material may have already accreted or blown off in the accretion-driven wind.
If the neutron star has either a low magnetic field or a low rotational spin
frequency, we would not expect to see the neutron star remnant of 1987a.

shown to be a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the large Fermi surface. For the
large Fermi surface its size is determined by the sum of the densities of the
conduction electrons and the localized spins. The correlation exponent K_rho of
this metallic phase is smaller than 1/2. At half-filling the ground state is
insulating. Excitation gaps are different depending on channels, the spin gap,
the charge gap and the quasiparticle gap. Temperature dependence of the spin
and charge susceptibilities and specific heat are discussed. Particularly
interesting is the temperature dependence of various excitation spectra, which
show unusual properties of the Kondo insulators.

magnetic fluctuations. In the present work we consider two situations. The
first one corresponds to a single hole in the two leg t-J spin ladder. In this
case the wave function renormalization is relatively small and the
quasiparticle residue of the S=1/2 state remains close to unity. However at
large t/J there are higher spin (S=3/2,5/2,..) bound states of the hole with
the magnetic excitations, and therefore there is a crossover from
quasiparticles with S=1/2 to quasiparticles with higher spin.
  The second situation corresponds to a single hole in two coupled
antiferromagnetic planes very close to the point of antiferromagnetic
instability. In this case the hole wave function renormalization is very strong
and the quasiparticle residue vanishes at the point of instability.

digit. One could guess that a fair bet should correspond to the frequency of
$1/9 = 11.11%$ for each digit from 1 to 9. This is by no means the case, and
one can easily observe a strong prevalence of the small values over the large
ones. The first three integers 1,2 and 3 alone have globally a frequency of 60%
while the other six values 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 appear only in 40% of the cases.
This situation is actually much more general than the stock market and it
occurs in a variety of number catalogs related to natural phenomena. The first
observation of this property traces back to S. Newcomb in 1881 but a more
precise account was given by F. Benford in 1938. In this note we illustrate
these observations with the enlightening specific example of the stock market.
We also identify the general mechanism for the origin of this uneven
distribution in the multiplicative nature of fluctuations in economics and in
many natural phenomena. This provides a natural explanation for the ubiquitous
presence of the Benford's law in many different phenomena with the common
element that their fluctuations refer to a fraction of their values. This
brings us close to the problem of the spontaneous origin of scale invariant
properties in various phenomena which is a debated question at the frontier of
different fields.

distribution look like for a free charge on a strictly one-dimensional wire of
finite length? To the best of our knowledge this question has so far not been
discussed anywhere. One notices that a solution of this problem is not as
simple as it might appear at first sight.

  Hyperbolic Plane","LaTeX 12 pp., one figure","Int.J.Theor.Phys. 38 (1999) 955-969",,"DESY 98-112","quant-ph",,"  In this paper I discuss by means of path integrals the quantum dynamics of a
charged particle on the hyperbolic plane under the influence of an
Aharonov-Bohm gauge field. The path integral can be solved in terms of an
expansion of the homotopy classes of paths. I discuss the interference pattern
of scattering by an Aharonov-Bohm gauge field in the flat space limit, yielding
a characteristic oscillating behavior in terms of the field strength. In
addition, the cases of the isotropic Higgs-oscillator and the Kepler-Coulomb
potential on the hyperbolic plane are shortly sketched.

function as potential is known to be completely integrable. Recently D'Hoker
and Phong found a beautiful parameterization by the polynomial of degree $N$ of
the space of Riemann surfaces associated with this system. In the trigonometric
limit of the elliptic potential these Riemann surfaces degenerate into rational
curves. The D'Hoker-Phong polynomial in the limit describes the intersection
points of the rational curves. We found an explicit determinant representation
of the polynomial in the trigonometric case. We consider applications of this
result to the theory of Toeplitz determinants and to geometry of the spectral
curves. We also prove our earlier conjecture on the asymptotic behavior of the
ratio of two symplectic volumes when the number of particles tends to infinity.
