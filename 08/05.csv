impact on cosmology by detecting relatively large numbers of dusty galaxies at
high redshift. Apart from identifying well-detected sources, such data can also
be mined for information about fainter sources and their correlations, as
revealed through low level fluctuations in SCUBA maps. As a first step in this
direction we analyse a small SCUBA data-set as if it were obtained from a
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) differencing experiment. This enables us to
place limits on CMB anisotropy at 850 microns. Expressed as Q_{flat}, the
quadrupole expectation value for a flat power spectrum, the limit is 152
microKelvin at 95 per cent confidence, corresponding to C_0^{1/2} < 355
microKelvin for a Gaussian autocorrelation function, with a coherence angle of
about 20--25 arcsec; These results could easily be reinterpretted in terms of
any other fluctuating sky signal. This is currently the best limit for these
scales at high frequency, and comparable to limits at similar angular scales in
the radio. Even with such a modest data-set, it is possible to put a constraint
on the slope of the SCUBA counts at the faint end, since even randomly
distributed sources would lead to fluctuations. Future analysis of sky
correlations in more extensive data-sets ought to yield detections, and hence
additional information on source counts and clustering.

local rich clusters of galaxies provide the two most powerful constraints on
cosmological models. When all variants of the standard cold dark matter (CDM)
model are subject to the combined constraint, the power spectrum of any model
is fixed to $\sim 10%$ accuracy in both the shape and overall amplitude. These
constrained models are not expected to differ dramatically in their local
large-scale structure properties. However, their evolutionary histories differ,
resulting in dramatic differences towards high redshift. We examine in detail
six standardized, COBE and cluster normalized CDM models with respect to a
large set of independent observations. The observations include correlation
function of rich clusters of galaxies, galaxy power spectrum, evolution of rich
cluster abundance, gravitational lensing by moderate -to-high redshift
clusters, $\lya$ forest, damped $\lya$ systems, high redshift galaxies,
reionization of the universe and future CMB experiments. It seems that each of
the independent observations examined is or potentially is capable of
distinguishing between at least some of the models. The combined power of
several or all of these observations is tremendous. Thus, we appear to be on
the verge of being able to make dramatic tests of all models in the near future
using a rapidly growing set of observations, mostly at moderate to high
redshift. Consistency or inconsistency between different observed phenomena on
different scales and/or at different epochs with respect to the models will
have profound implications for theory of growth of cosmic structure.

nucleus of NGC 4258. There is no direct evidence that the nucleus has been
steadily accreting on the viscous timescale of the outer masing disk, which is
>~ 10^9 \yr. Thus the mass accretion rate in the outer disk need not be the
same as in the inner accretion flow where most of the gravitational binding
energy is released. We show that an advection-dominated flow model with a
transition radius of \sim (10-100) M (where M is the mass of the hole) and
\mdot \approx 10^{-2}\msun \yr^{-1} is consistent with the observed spectrum
from radio to X-rays. We also show that a thin (flat or warped) disk can fit
the observed fluxes outside the X-ray band. The X-rays can be explained by
means of a corona in such a model, but the absence of radio emission from the
location of the putative central black hole provides a serious constraint on
the properties of the corona. A wide range of accretion rates, 10^{-4} <~ \mdot
<~ 10^{-2} \msun\yr^{-1}, can be made to fit the data, but the most ``natural''
models have 10^{-3} <~ \mdot <~ 10^{-2} \msun\yr^{-1}. Physical conditions in
the observed VLBI jet features can also be related to conditions in the inner
accretion flow. We conclude with a list of future observations that might help
to constrain the accretion rate.

quadratic regularization approaches and correspond, in Bayesian interpretation,

  Lett",,"10.1209/epl/i1998-00448-8",,"cond-mat.stat-mech comp-gas cond-mat.soft nlin.CG",,"  The lattice Boltzmann equation can be viewed as a discretization of the
continuous Boltzmann equation. Because of this connection it has long been
speculated that lattice Boltzmann algorithms might obey an H-theorem. In this
letter we prove that usual nine-velocity models do not obey an H-theorem but
models that do obey an H-theorem can be constructed. We consider the general
conditions a lattice Boltzmann scheme must satisfy in order to obey an
H-theorem and show why on a lattice, unlike the continuous case, dynamics that
decrease an H-functional do not necessarily lead to a unique ground state.

the consistent histories approach allows contrary inferences to be made from
the same data. These inferences correspond to projections $P$ and $Q$,
belonging to different consistent sets, with the properties that $PQ = QP = 0$
and $P \neq 1 -Q$. To many, this seems undesirable in a theory of physical
inferences. It also raises a specific problem for the consistent histories
formalism, since that formalism is set up so as to eliminate contradictory
inferences, i.e. inferences $P$ and $Q$ where $P = 1 - Q$. Yet there seems to
be no sensible physical distinction between contradictory and contrary
inferences.
  It seems particularly hard to defend the asymmetry, since (i) there is a
well-defined quantum histories formalisms which admits both contradictory and
contrary inferences, and (ii) there is also a well-defined formalism, based on
ordered consistent sets of histories, which excludes both.
  In a recent comment, Griffiths and Hartle, while accepting the validity of
the examples given in the above paper, restate their own preference for the
consistent histories formalism. As this brief reply explains, in so doing, they
fail to address the arguments made against their approach to quantum theory.

can therefore be compared with the type II side result. We point out several

prediction. The theories are based on the general idea of probabilistic
detection of particles depending on an interaction of hidden variables within
the measuring device and particle, and relate mathematically to Fourier
analysis. The crucial discrepancy of variations in the hidden variable
distribution based on relative polarizer orientations is isolated which
invalidates assumptions in Bell-type theorems. The first theory can be analyzed
completely symbolically whereas the second was analyzed using numerical
methods. The properties of the second in particular are shown to be
approximately consistent with the reported results and uncertainties in all
three Aspect experiments. Variation in the total photon pairs detected over

information} number to define, meaningfully, a metric on the set of all
possible states of a given quantum system. They showed that the quantum
information is nothing else than the maximal Fisher information in a
measurement of the quantum system, maximized over all possible measurements.
Combining this fact with classical statistical results, they argued that the
quantum information determines the asymptotically optimal rate at which
neighbouring states on some smooth curve can be distinguished, based on
arbitrary measurements on $n$ identical copies of the given quantum system.
  We show that the measurement which maximizes the Fisher information typically
depends on the true, unknown, state of the quantum system. We close the
resulting loophole in the argument by showing that one can still achieve the
same, optimal, rate of distinguishability, by a two stage adaptive measurement
procedure.
  When we consider states lying not on a smooth curve, but on a manifold of
higher dimension, the situation becomes much more complex. We show that the
notion of ``distinguishability of close-by states'' depends strongly on the
measurement resources one allows oneself, and on a further specification of the
task at hand. The quantum information matrix no longer seems to play a central
role.
