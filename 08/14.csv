arises from a dependence on the line of sight to an axially symmetric BLR.
Adopting a simple model for the line width as a function of luminosity and
angle, and convolving this with the observed luminosity function, allows us to
predict a line width distribution consistent with the available data.
Furthermore, we use the relation between the equivalent width of a line and the
luminosity in the continuum to predict an observed correlation between line
width and equivalent width. The scatter on this correlation is again provided
by angular dependence. We also show a viewing angle dependence can produce the
X-ray spectral index distribution. The results have applications as diagnostics
of models of the broad line region and in cosmology.

Theoretical calculations provide a good understanding and fit to the observed

intensity fluctuation which is correlated with the oscillation they generate,
thereby affecting the shape of the line in the p-mode power spectra and
reversing the sense of asymmetry (this point was recognized by Nigam et al. and
Roxburgh & Vorontsov). The addition of the correlated noise displaces the
frequencies of peaks in the power spectrum. Depending on the amplitude of the
noise source the shift in the position of the peak can be substantially larger
than the frequency shift in the velocity power spectra. In neither case are the
peak frequencies precisely equal to the eigenfrequencies of p-modes. We suggest
two observations which can provide a test of the model discussed here.

top-heavy at early times. This would be plausible physically if the IMF depends
on a mass scale such as the Jeans mass that was higher at earlier times because
of the generally higher temperatures that were present then. In this paper it
is suggested, on the basis of current evidence and theory, that the IMF has a
universal Salpeter-like form at the upper end but flattens below a
characteristic stellar mass that may vary with time. Much of the evidence that
has been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, including the ubiquitous G-dwarf
problem, the high abundance of heavy elements in clusters of galaxies, and the
high rate of formation of massive stars in high-redshift galaxies, can be
accounted for with such an IMF if the characteristic stellar mass was several
times higher during the early stages of galaxy evolution. However, significant
variations in the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies and large amounts of dark
matter in stellar remnants are not as easily explained in this way because they
require more extreme and less plausible assumptions about the form and
variability of the IMF. Metal-free 'population III' stars are predicted to have
an IMF that consists exclusively of massive stars, and they could help to
account for some of the evidence that has been attributed to a top-heavy early
IMF, as well as contributing importantly to the energetics and chemical
enrichment of the early universe.

have started <100 Myr ago, is an asymmetric stellar ring dominating the
intensity profile of NGC 7714 in the inner disk (~ 2 exponential scale
lengths). In agreement to previous Einstein-data our ROSAT PSPC exposure shows
the X-ray emission of Arp 284 to be confined to NGC 7714. The bulk of the
intrinsic X-ray luminosity in the ROSAT 0.1--2.4 keV band can be accounted for
by thermal emission from hot (~5x10**6 K) gas and amounts to ~2-4 x 10**41
erg/sec. Follow-up observations with the ROSAT HRI revealed two distinct
extended emitting regions contributing to the X-ray luminosity in NGC 7714. The
more luminous of them (L_X < 2 x 10*41 erg/sec) coincides with the central
starburst nucleus and can be explained this way. The fainter one (L_X~ 8x10**40

optical counterpart. It is, likely, located at the borderline between the
stellar ring and a massive (>10**9 M(solar)) HI-bridge further to the east
possibly intersecting NGC 7714. The HI and X-ray morphology and the extensive
starburst nature of the nuclear energy source suggest different scenarios for
the formation of the eastern emission spot. The possibilities of (i)
collisional heating of the outlying gas by a starburst-driven nuclear wind and

many others with accreting neutron stars, is known to exhibit strong
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of its X-ray flux near 1 kHz. In addition to
the kilohertz QPOs, the Fourier power spectra show a broken power law noise
component, with a break frequency between 1 and 50 Hz, and a Lorentzian between
10 and 50 Hz. We find that the frequencies of the break and the low-frequency
Lorentzian are well correlated with the frequencies of the kilohertz QPOs. The
slope of the correlation is similar to that expected if the oscillations are
due to relativistic frame dragging (Lense-Thirring precession) in the inner
accretion disk (Stella & Vietri 1998). The correlation is also nearly identical
to the one found in Z-sources between the the well known QPOs on the horizontal
branch and the kilohertz QPOs, suggesting that the low frequency oscillations
are a similar phenomenon in these sources. The frequency of the break in the
power spectra is also correlated with the frequencies of the kilohertz QPOs. As
previously noted for the similar binaries 4U 1608-50 and 4U 1705-44, this
broken power law component closely resembles that of black hole candidates in

and beyond, two optical radii (defined by the 25th B-band isophote). The
outermost HII regions appear small, faint and isolated, compared to their inner
disk counterparts, and are distributed in organized spiral arm structures,
likely associated with underlying HI arms and faint stellar arms. The
relationship between the azimuthally--averaged Halpha surface brightness
(proportional to star formation rate per unit area) and the total gas surface
density is observed to steepen considerably at low gas surface densities. We
find that this effect is largely driven by a sharp decrease in the covering
factor of star formation at large radii, and not by changes in the rate at
which stars form locally. An azimuthally--averaged analysis of the
gravitational stability of the disk of NGC6946 reveals that while the existence
of star formation in the extreme outer disk is consistent with the Toomre-Q
instability model, the low rates observed are only compatible with the model
when a constant gaseous velocity dispersion is assumed. We suggest that
observed behaviour could also be explained by a model in which the star
formation rate has an intrinsic dependence on the azimuthally-averaged gas
volume density, which decreases rapidly in the outer disk due to the vertical
flaring of the gas layer.

length frequency and sequential distribution to develop a mathematical
characterization of some of the language features distinguishing isometrically
lineated text from unlineated text, in other words the features distinguishing
isometrical verse from prose. It is shown that the frequency of syllables
making complete words produces a flat distribution for prose, while that for
verse exhibits peaks at the line length position and subsequent multiples of
that position. Data from several verse authors is presented, including a
detailed mathematical analysis of the dynamics underlying peak creation, and
comments are offered on the processes by which authors construct lines. We note
that the word-length sequence of prose is random, whereas lineation
necessitates non-random word-length sequencing, and that this has the probable
consequence of introducing a degree of randomness into the otherwise highly
ordered grammatical sequence. In addition we observe that this effect can be
ameliorated by a reduction in the mean word length of the text (confirming
earlier observations that verse tends to use shorter words) and the use of
lines varying from the core isometrical set. The frequency of variant lines is
shown to be coincident with the frequency of polysyllables, suggesting that the
use of variant lines is motivated by polysyllabic word placement. The
restrictive effects of different line lengths, the relationship between
metrical restriction and poetic effect, and the general character of metrical
rules are also discussed.

depth only measures degrees of macroscopic randomness, not structure. To fix
this we redefine the depth in terms of the causal state

of {\em locally} interacting particles, namely a kicked $t-V$ model of spinless
fermions on 1-dim lattice (equivalent to a kicked Heisenberg XX-Z chain of 1/2
spins). Statistical properties of dynamics (quantum ergodicity and quantum
mixing) and the nature of quantum transport in {\em thermodynamic limit} are
considered as the kick parameters (which control the degree of
non-integrability) are varied. We find and demonstrate {\em ballistic}
transport and non-ergodic, non-mixing dynamics (implying infinite conductivity
at all temperatures) in the {\em integrable} regime of zero or very small kick
parameters, and more generally and important, also in {\em non-integrable}
regime of {\em intermediate} values of kicked parameters, whereas only for
sufficiently large kick parameters we recover quantum ergodicity and mixing
implying normal (diffusive) transport. We propose an order parameter (charge
stiffness $D$) which controls the phase transition from non-mixing/non-ergodic
dynamics (ordered phase, $D>0$) to mixing/ergodic dynamics (disordered phase,
D=0) in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we find {\em exponential decay of
time-correlation function} in the regime of mixing dynamics.
  The results are obtained consistently within three different numerical and
analytical approaches: (i) time evolution of a finite system and direct
computation of time correlation functions, (ii) full diagonalization of finite
systems and statistical analysis of stationary data, and (iii) algebraic
construction of quantum invariants of motion of an infinite system, in

turns out that, while energy minimization strategies can identify correct
solutions in most circumstances, it may be impossible for numerical
implementations of design algorithms to meet the efficiency required to yield
correct solutions in realistic contexts. We also investigated how the design
efficiency varies when putative solutions are required to obey some external
