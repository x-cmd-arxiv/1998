gasdynamics and star formation to investigate the origin of the Tully-Fisher
relation in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Luminosities are computed
for each model galaxy using their full star formation histories and the latest
spectrophotometric models. We find that at z=0 the stellar mass of model
galaxies is proportional to the total baryonic mass within the virial radius of
their surrounding halos. Circular velocity then correlates tightly with the
total luminosity of the galaxy, reflecting the equivalence between mass and
circular velocity of systems identified in a cosmological context. The slope of
the relation steepens slightly from the red to the blue bandpasses, and is in
fairly good agreement with observations. Its scatter is small, decreasing from
\~0.45 mag in the U-band to ~0.34 mag in the K-band. The particular
cosmological model we explore here seems unable to account for the zero-point
of the correlation. Model galaxies are too faint at z=0 (by about two
magnitudes) if the circular velocity at the edge of the luminous galaxy is used
as an estimator of the rotation speed. The Tully-Fisher relation is brighter in
the past, by about ~0.7 magnitudes in the B-band at z=1, at odds with recent
observations of z~1 galaxies. We conclude that the slope and tightness of the
Tully-Fisher relation can be naturally explained in hierarchical models but
that its normalization and evolution depend strongly on the star formation
algorithm chosen and on the cosmological parameters that determine the
universal baryon fraction and the time of assembly of galaxies of different
mass.

Ly $\alpha$ forest clouds in the framework of the two component model suggested
by Chiba & Nath (1997). We find that even if the mini-halos were chemically
enriched by an earlier generation of stars, to have [C/H] $\simeq$ -2.5, the
number of C IV lines with column density $>10^{12} cm^{-2}$, contributed by the
mini-halos, at the redshift of 3, would be only about 10% of the total number
of lines, for a chemical enrichment rate of $(1+z)^{-3}$ in the galaxies.
Recently reported absence of heavy element lines associated with most of the Ly
$\alpha$ lines with H I column density between $10^{13.5} cm^{-2}$ and $10^{14}
cm^{-2}$ by Lu et al (1998), if correct, gives an upper limit on [C/H]=-3.7,
not only in the mini-halos, but also in the outer parts of galactic halos. This
is consistent with the results of numerical simulations, according to which,
the chemical elements associated with the Ly $\alpha$ clouds are formed in situ
in clouds, rather than in an earlier generation of stars. However, the mean
value of $7 \times 10^{-3}$ for the column density ratio of C IV and H I,
determined by Cowie and Songaila (1998) for low Lyman alpha optical depths,
implies an abundance of [C/H] =-2.5 in mini-halos as well as in most of the
region in galactic halos, presumably enriched by an earlier generation of
stars. The redshift and column density distribution of C IV has been shown to
be in reasonable agreement with the observations.

core of the earth, dominates for $\Delta m^2 \simeq (1 - 2)\times 10^{-3}$

an observable excess of the e-like events with a specific zenith angle

e-like events can reach 15% for $|\cos \Theta_e| > 0.2$ and up to 30% for

study the effect of the B-field on four dimensional large N gauge theories from
orientifolds. Thus, in theories with both D3- and D7-branes, the effect of the
B-field is non-trivial: the number of D7-branes (of each species) is reduced
from 8 (which is the required number if the B-field is trivial) to 4. This
results in a different orientifold string theory, and, subsequently, the
corresponding large N gauge theory is also different. We explicitly construct
large N gauge theories from orientifolds with non-zero B-field backgrounds with
${\cal N}=2,1,0$ supersymmetries. These theories, just as their counterparts
without the B-field, have the property that in the large N limit computation of
any M-point correlation function reduces to the corresponding computation in
the parent ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric theory with a unitary gauge group.
