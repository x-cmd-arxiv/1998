stars in light of the Hipparcos mission and other recent developments. We focus
on identifying possible systematic errors and rank the methods by relative
immunity to such errors. For the three most robust methods, statistical
parallax, trigonometric parallax, and cluster kinematics, we find M_V (at
[Fe/H] = -1.6) of 0.77 +/- 0.13, 0.71 +/- 0.15, 0.67 +/- 0.10. These methods
cluster consistently around 0.71 +/- 0.07. We find that Baade-Wesselink and
theoretical models both yield a broad range of possible values (0.45-0.70 and
0.45-0.65) due to systematic uncertainties in the temperature scale and input
physics. Main-sequence fitting gives a much brighter M_V = 0.45 +/- 0.04 but
this may be due to a difference in the metallicity scales of the cluster giants
and the calibrating subdwarfs. White-dwarf cooling-sequence fitting gives 0.67
+/- 0.13 and is potentially very robust, but at present is too new to be fully
tested for systematics. If the three most robust methods are combined with
Walker's mean measurement for 6 LMC clusters, V_{0,LMC} = 18.98 +/- 0.03 at
[Fe/H] = -1.9, then mu_{LMC} = 18.33 +/- 0.08.

  Journal, October 1998",,"10.1086/300574",,"astro-ph",,"  Near infrared (NIR) and optical surface photometric analyses of the dusty
galaxy NGC972 are presented. The photometric profiles in the BVRJHK bands can
be fitted with a combination of gaussian and exponential profiles,
corresponding to a starburst nucleus and a stellar disk respectively. The
exponential scale length in the B-band is 2.8 times larger than in the K-band,
which implies a central B-band optical depth as high as 11. A bulge is absent
even in the NIR bands and hence the galaxy must be of a morphological type
later than the usually adopted Sb type. Relatively low rotational velocity and
high gas content also favor a later type, probably Sd, for the galaxy. Only one
arm can be traced in the distribution of old stars; the second arm, however,
can be traced in the distribution of dust and HII regions. Data suggest a short
NIR bar, which ends inside the nuclear ring. The slowly rising nature of the
rotation curve rules out a resonance origin of the the nuclear ring. The ring
is most likely not in the plane of the galaxy, given its circular appearance in
spite of the moderately high inclination of the galaxy. The off-planar nature
of the star forming ring, the unusually high fraction (30%) of the total mass
in molecular form, the presence of a nuclear starburst and the asymmetry of
spiral arms, are probably the result of a merger with a gas-rich companion
galaxy.

intermittency in two coupled one-dimensional (1D) maps. We find two fixed maps
of the renormalization transformation. They all have common relevant
eigenvalues associated with scaling of the control parameter of the uncoupled
1D map. However, the relevant ``coupling eigenvalues'' associated with coupling
perturbations vary depending on the fixed maps. It is also found that the two
fixed maps are associated with the critical behavior in the vicinity of a
critical line segment. One fixed map with no relevant coupling eigenvalues
governs the critical behavior at interior points of the critical line segment,
while the other one with relevant coupling eigenvalues governs the critical
behavior at both ends. The results of the two coupled 1D maps are also extended
to many globally-coupled 1D maps, in which each 1D map is coupled to all the
other ones with equal strength.

system, such as rapid temperature decreasing, many novel and complex patterns
often form.
  To understand such phenomena, a general mechanism is proposed based on the
competition between heat transfer and conversion of heat to other energy forms.
We apply it to the smectic-A filament growth process during quench-induced
isotropic to smectic-A phase transition. Analytical forms for the buckling
patterns are derived and we find good agreement with experimental observation
[Phys. Rev. {\bf E55} (1997) 1655]. The present work strongly indicates that
rapid cooling will lead to structural transitions in the smectic-A filament at
the molecular level to optimize heat conversion. The force associated with this
pattern formation process is estimated to be in the order of $10^{-1}$
piconewton.

theories based on Genetic Algorithms(GAs). Main difference between GAs and
Metropolis methods(MPs) is that GAs treat a population of points at once, while
MPs treat only one point in the searching space. This provides GAs with
information about the assortment as well as the fitness of the evolution
function and producting a better solution. We apply GAs to SU(2) pure gauge
theory on a 2 dimensional lattice and show the results are consistent with
those given by MP and Heatbath methods(HBs). Thermalization speed of GAs is
especially faster than the simple MPs.

$L_q(x)={<M_L(x)>}\Delta q_{QM}(x)$. The quark orbital angular momentum
$L_q(x)$ and the quark helicity distribution $\Delta q(x)$ are connected to the
quark model spin distribution $\Delta q_{QM}(x)$ by a relation:
$\frac{1}{2}\Delta q(x)+ L_q(x)=\frac{1}{2}\Delta q_{QM}(x)$, which means that
one can decompose the quark model spin contribution $\Delta q_{QM}(x)$ by a
quark helicity term $\Delta q(x)$ {\it plus} an orbital angular momentum term
$L_q(x)$. There is also a new relation connecting the quark orbital angular
momentum with the measurable quark helicity distribution and transversity
distribution ($\delta q(x)$): $\Delta q(x)+L_q(x)=\delta q(x)$, from which we
may have new sum rules connecting the quark orbital angular momentum with the
nucleon axial and tensor charges.

and vector fields admit unique ""improved"" currents of arbitrary spin, traceless
and conserved. Off-criticality as well as at interacting fixed points
conservation is violated and the dimension of the current is anomalous. In
particular, currents J^(s,I) with spin s between 0 and 5 (and a second label I)
appear in the operator product expansion of the stress tensor. The TT OPE is
worked out in detail for free fields; projectors and invariants encoding the
space-time structure are classified. The result is used to write and discuss
the most general OPE for interacting conformal field theories and
off-criticality. Higher spin central charges c_(s,I) with arbitrary s are
defined by higher spin channels of the many-point T-correlators and central
functions interpolating between the UV and IR limits are constructed. We
compute the one-loop values of all c_(s,I) and investigate the RG trajectories
of quantum field theories in the conformal window following our approach. In
particular, we discuss certain phenomena (perturbative and nonperturbative)
that appear to be of interest, like the dynamical removal of the I-degeneracy.
Finally, we address the problem of formulating an action principle for the RG
trajectory connecting pairs of CFT's as a way to go beyond perturbation theory.
