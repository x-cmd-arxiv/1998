magnetic fields, collisionless relativistic particles, hydrodynamic shear
viscosity, gravitational waves, skew axion fields in low-energy string
cosmologies, or topological defects. We investigate the effects of such
stresses on cosmological evolution, and in particular on the dissipation of
shear anisotropy. We generalize some previous results that were given for
homogeneous anisotropic universes, by including small inhomogeneity in the
universe. This generalization is facilitated by a covariant approach. We find
that anisotropic stress dominates the evolution of shear, slowing its decay.
The effect is strongest in radiation-dominated universes, where there is slow
logarithmic decay of shear.

Using reasonable parameters, this leads to four possibilities depending on the
time and duration of the energy input: delayed last scattering, double last
scattering, shifted last scattering and total reionization. We show that these
possibilities are only very weakly constrained by the limits on spectral
distortions from the COBE FIRAS measurements. We illustrate the effects of
these reionization possibilities on the angular power spectrum of temperature
anisotropies and polarization for simple passive isocurvature models and simple
coherent sources, observing the difference between passive and active models.
Finally, we comment on the implications of this work for more realistic active
sources, such as causal white noise and topological defect models. We show for
these models that non-standard ionization histories can shift the peak in the
CMB power to larger angular scales.

flux limit of ~10^{-16} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} corresponding to a luminosity limit
of ~10^{41} ergs at this redshift for a H_0=50 km s^{-1} Mpc,^{-1} q_0=0.5

their rest-frame ultraviolet (2800A) luminosity. The mean star-formation rate

ultraviolet estimates. The standard dust extinction in these galaxies is
inferred to be A_V=0.5-1.0 mags, comparable to local field galaxies, suggesting
that the bulk of star-formation is not heavily obscured unless one uses greyer
extinction laws. Star-forming galaxies have the bluest colours and a
preponderance of disturbed/interacting morphologies. We also investigate the
effects of particular star-formation histories, in particular the role of
bursts vs continuous star-formation in changing the detailed distribution of UV
to H-alpha emission. Generally we find that models dominated by short,
overlapping, bursts at typically 0.2 Gyr intervals provide a better model for
the data than a constant rate of star-formation. The star-formation history of
the Universe from Balmer lines is compiled and found to be typically 2--3\times

which are often accompanied by X-ray and optical afterglows. The total energy
emitted in the afterglow can be similar to the energy radiated in the gamma-ray
burst itself. If a galaxy containing a large column density of dust is near the
line of sight to a gamma-ray burst, small-angle scattering of the X-rays due to
diffraction by the dust grains will give rise to an X-ray echo of the
afterglow. A measurement of the angular size of the echo at a certain time
after the afterglow is observed yields a combination of the angular diameter
distances to the scattering galaxy and the gamma-ray burst that can be used to
constrain cosmological models in the same way as a time delay in a
gravitational lens. The scattering galaxy will generally cause gravitational
lensing as well, and this should modify the shape of the X-ray echo from a
circular ring.
  The main difficulty in detecting this phenomenon is the very low flux
expected for the echo. The flux can be increased when the gamma-ray burst is
highly magnified by gravitational lensing, or when the deflecting galaxy is at
low redshift. X-ray echos of continuous (but variable) sources, such as
quasars, may also be detectable with high-resolution instruments and would
allow similar measurements.

set the power-law indices, otherwise, they are set by the behavior of the

differently by coupling the sea-bosons to an inhomogeneous chemical potential.
It is shown that many of the salient features of the free theory are reproduced
properly by this approach. An attempt is made to be as detailed as possible,
this includes providing formulas for the sea-bosons as well as computing the

landscape. One funnel ends in the global minimum, a face-centred-cubic (fcc)
truncated octahedron. At the bottom of the other funnel is the second lowest
energy minimum which is an incomplete Mackay icosahedron. We characterize the
energy landscape in two ways. Firstly, from a large sample of minima and
transition states we construct a disconnectivity tree showing which minima are
connected below certain energy thresholds. Secondly we compute the free energy
as a function of a bond-order parameter. The free energy profile has two
minima, one which corresponds to the fcc funnel and the other which at low
temperature corresponds to the icosahedral funnel and at higher temperatures to
the liquid-like state. These two approaches show that the greater width of the
icosahedral funnel, and the greater structural similarity between the
icosahedral structures and those associated with the liquid-like state, are the
cause of the smaller free energy barrier for entering the icosahedral funnel
from the liquid-like state and therefore of the cluster's preferential entry
into this funnel on relaxation down the energy landscape. Furthermore, the
large free energy barrier between the fcc and icosahedral funnels, which is
energetic in origin, causes the cluster to be trapped in one of the funnels at
low temperature. These results explain in detail the link between the
double-funnel energy landscape and the difficulty of global optimization for
this cluster.

field is derived from the two-loop, two-particle-irreducible closed-time-path
effective action. We numerically solve the dynamical equations for the
two-point function and we identify signatures of topological defects in the

of topological defects formed after the phase transition scales as a power law
with the expansion rate of the Universe. We calculate the equilibrium critical
exponents of the correlation length and relaxation time for this model and show
that the power law exponent of the defect density, for both overdamped and
underdamped evolution, is in good agreement with the ""freeze-out"" scenario of
Zurek. We introduce an analytic dynamical model, valid near the critical point,

the only second allowable symmetry is either the translational symmetry or the

on the luminosity, and assuming a branching ratio B(LQ -> eq)=0.5, we find a
discovery reach up to 170 (255) GeV for scalar leptoquarks at the current
(upgraded) Tevatron. Similarly, we find vector leptoquarks to be detectable at
masses below 300 (400) GeV depending on the coupling. At the LHC, the discovery
reach is enhanced to 1 TeV for scalar leptoquarks and to 1.5 TeV for vectors.

theory. It was found that it has common roots with the problem of cosmological
singularity. In the context of fibre bundles the second quantization method is
represented as a procedure of the quantization for vector bundle cross-section.
It is shown to be quite a different quantization way called as a fibre
quantization which leads to an idea on existence of the non-standard dynamical
system, i.e. the relativistic be-Hamiltonian system. It takes place on
supersmall distances and is well described by the mathematical apparatus for
the non-unitary quantum scheme using a dual pair of topological vector spaces
in terms of the non-Hermitian form. The article contains the proof of the
theorem on radical changes in space and in matter structure taking place for a
very high density of matter: the phase transitions ``Lagrangian field system
(elementary particles) $\to$ relativistic bi-Hamiltonian system (Feynman's
partons)'' and ``continuum $\to$ discontinuum''.
  All required calculations in the framework of the proposed theory are
published in the Russian periodicals. The purpose of this article is to replace
the calculations by reasonings and concepts. The present article begins the
systematic exposition of principles of the theory.

measurements, when the interaction times fluctuate randomly. It is based on
selection of superposed atomic states whose phase correlations tend to suppress
the phase fluctuations of each separate state. One suggested realization
involves the convergence of the cavity field distribution to a single Fock
state by conditional measurements performed on two-level atoms with fluctuating
velocities after they cross the cavity. Another realization involves a trapped
ion whose internal-motional state coupling fluctuates randomly. Its motional
state is made to converge to a Fock state by conditional measurements of the
internal state of the ion.

different solitons move in different velocities, each component U_{ij} of the
solution U has at most m_i m_j peaks as t tends to infinity. This corresponds
to the (M,N) solitons for the DSI equation. When all the solitons move in the

solution of a Painlev\'e equation in terms of Fredholm determinants of integral

t^{-1} \sinh\psi$, a special case of the Painlev\'e III equation. The proof in
the cited paper is complicated, and the purpose of this note is to give a more
straightforward one. First we give an equivalent formulation of the solution in
terms of the kernel ${e^{-t (x+x^{-1})/2}\over x+y}\Big|{x-1\over
x+1}\Big|^{2\alpha}$. There are already in the literature relatively simple
proofs of the fact that when $\alpha=0$ Fredholm determinants of this kernel
give solutions to the equation. We extend this result here to general $\alpha$.
