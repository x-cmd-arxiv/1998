  in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/306597",,"astro-ph",,"  Many nearby early-type (elliptical and S0) galaxies contain weak
(milli-Jansky level) nuclear radio sources on scales a few hundred parsecs or
less. The origin of the radio emission, however, has remained unclear,
especially in volume-limited samples that select intrinsically less luminous
galaxies. Both active galactic nuclei and nuclear star formation have been
suggested as possible mechanisms for producing the radio emission. This paper
utilizes optical spectroscopic information to address this issue. A substantial
fraction of the early-type galaxies surveyed with the Very Large Array by
Wrobel & Heeschen (1991) exhibits detectable optical emission lines in their
nuclei down to very sensitive limits. Comparison of the observed radio
continuum power with that expected from the thermal gas traced by the optical
emission lines implies that the bulk of the radio emission is nonthermal. Both
the incidence and the strength of optical line emission correlate with the
radio power. At a fixed line luminosity, ellipticals have stronger radio cores
than S0s. The relation between radio power and line emission observed in this
sample is consistent with the low-luminosity extension of similar relations
seen in classical radio galaxies and luminous Seyfert nuclei. A plausible
interpretation of this result is that the weak nuclear sources in nearby
early-type galaxies are the low-luminosity counterparts of more powerful AGNs.
The spectroscopic evidence supports this picture. Most of the emission-line
objects are optically classified as Seyfert nuclei or low-ionization nuclear
emission-line regions (LINERs), the majority of which are likely to be
accretion-powered sources.

the nonlinear gravitational effects on $\xi$, to contrast the behavior of $\xi$
for halos vs. matter, and to quantify the redshift evolution of $\xi$ and its
dependence on cosmological parameters. Overall, $\xi$ for halos exhibits
markedly slower evolution than $\xi$ for matter, and its redshift dependence is
much more intricate than the single power-law parameterization used in the
literature. Of particular interest is that the redshift evolution of the
halo-halo correlation length $r_0$ depends strongly on $\Omega_m$ and
$\Omega_\nu$, being slower in models with lower $\Omega_m$ or higher
$\Omega_\nu$. Measurements of $\xi$ to higher redshifts can therefore be a
potential discriminator of cosmological parameters. The evolution rate of $r_0$
for halos within a given model increases with time, passing the phase of fixed
comoving clustering at $z\sim 1$ to 3 toward the regime of stable clustering at
$z\sim 0$. The shape of the halo-halo $\xi$, on the other hand, is well
approximated by a power law with slope -1.8 in all models and is not a

magnetized intra- cluster medium (ICM) is required, in which the density of the
relativistic electrons is anticorrelated with the magnetic fields. This could
be understood if the electrons were accelerated during a major merger event
within the last 2 Gyr and cooled afterwards in the inhomogeneous fields. If the
EUV excess is due to starlight-IC, a population of relativistic, very low
energy electrons has to be present, with a high energy density. In order to
survive Coulomb losses, these electrons have to be separated from the cluster
gas by confining magnetic fields. This could be remnant radio plasma from the
epoch of violent quasar activity. The observed narrow radial profile of the EUV
excess emission is due to the narrow photon distribution for this model. Both
models favor very inhomogeneous magnetic field and relativistic electron
distributions. IC models for the HEX excess seem to be implausible: CMB-IC
leads to a mainly unmagnetized ICM, in contradiction to Faraday rotation
measurements. Starlight scattering electrons would overproduce EUV photons due

after a central protostar exists, and grows by dynamical accretion from the
flattened envelope. We estimate a centrifugal radius for the collapse of mass
shells within a rotating, magnetized cloud core. The centrifugal radius of the
inner disk is related to its mass through the two important parameters
characterizing the background medium: the background rotation rate $\Omb$ and
the background magnetic field strength $\Bref$. We also revisit the issue of
how rapidly mass is deposited onto the disk (the mass accretion rate) and use
several recent models to comment upon the likely outcome in magnetized cores.
Our model predicts that a significant centrifugal disk (much larger than a
stellar radius) will be present in the very early (Class 0) stage of
protostellar evolution. Additionally, we derive an upper limit for the disk
radius as it evolves due to internal torques, under the assumption that the
star-disk system conserves its mass and angular momentum even while most of the
mass is transferred to a central star.

unified whole quantum system, where, the superimposition of a continuum of
eddies results in the observed global weather patterns with long-range
spatiotemporal correlations such as that of the widely investigated El Nino
phenomenon. Large eddies are visualised as envelopes enclosing smaller eddies,
thereby generating a hierarchy of eddy circulations, originating initially from
a fixed primary small scale energising perturbation, e.g. the frictional upward
momentum flux at the boundary layer of the earth's surface. In this paper it is
shown that the relative motion concepts of Einstein's special and general

reached in two steps. First, before the time t_1 necessary to propagate over
L_1, the interaction slows down the ballistic motion. On the contrary, after
t_1 the interaction favors a very slow delocalization, characterized by a
$\log(t)$ spreading of the center of mass, until L_2 is reached. This slow
motion is related to the absence of quantum chaos in this one dimensional
model, the interaction being only able to induce weaker chaos with critical
spectral statistics. Under appropriate initial conditions, the motion remains
invariant under the duality transformation mapping the behavior at small U onto
the behavior at large U.

taken into account: accurate geometries and anharmonic force fields were thus
obtained as by-products. Our best computed $\Delta H^\circ_{f,0}$ for
trans-HNNH, 49.2 \pm 0.3 kcal/mol, is in very good agreement with a recent
experimental lower limit of 48.8 \pm 0.5 kcal/mol. CCSD(T) basis set limit
values for the isomerization energies at 0 K are 5.2 \pm 0.2 kcal/mol
(cis-trans) and 24.1 \pm 0.2 kcal/mol (iso-trans). Our best computed geometry
for trans-HNNH, $r_e$(NN)=1.2468 \AA, $r_e$(NH)=1.0283 \AA, and
$\theta_e$=106.17$^\circ$, reproduces the precisely known ground-state
rotational constants of trans-HNNH to within better than 0.1 %. The
rotation-vibration spectra of both cis-HNNH and H$_2$NN are dominated by very
strong Coriolis and Fermi resonances. In addition, the NH stretches in H$_2$NN
are so strongly anharmonic that vibrational perturbation theory breaks down,
and the molecule appears to be an excellent test case for variational
treatments of the vibrational Schr\""odinger equation.

optical response of conjugated carbon molecules in the energy range of 0-30 eV,
with calculations given for carbon chains, polyenes, retinal, benzene and C_60.
The major feature of the spectra, the collective pi-pi* transition, is seen at
energies ranging from below 2 to 7 eV, and is reproduced by the theory to a few
tenths of an eV with a good account of systematic trends. However, there is
some indication that TDLDA predicts too much fragmentation of the strength
function in large molecules. Transition strengths are reproduced with a typical
accuracy of 20%. The theory also predicts a broad absorption peak in the range
15-25 eV, and this feature agrees with experiment in the one case where
quantitative data is available (benzene).

Darboux intertwining operators. The case in which the deformed transformation
function is of the vacuum type is detailed, but the extension to counterparts
of excited states used as Darboux transformation functions is also formally
discussed. The method leads to second-order Fokker-Planck-like deformed
operators which may be considered as supersymmetric partners, though for a sort
of q-deformed open systems, i.e., those possessing q nonlocal drift terms,
potential part, as well as q-spreaded vacuum fluctuations. The undeformed limit
corresponds to the conservative case, since all q nonlocalities wash out. The
procedure is applied to the x^{-2} singular oscillator, for which we also
present a formal q generalization of the Bagrov-Samsonov coherent states
