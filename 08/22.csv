configurations and field perturbations in forming the particle energy spectrum
and changing the acceleration time scale is considered. Then, we report on two
interesting attempts to consider particle acceleration at ultra-relativistic
shocks. Finally, in contrast to the compressive shock discontinuities, we
discuss the acceleration processes acting in the boundary layer at the
tangential velocity transition. The second-order Fermi acceleration as well as
the cosmic ray `viscous' acceleration provide the mechanisms generating
energetic particles there.

continuum variations with a time delay or lag of 10-20 days, the precise value

dominated (GPD) disks, we show that the Newtonian conclusion that such disks
are viscously stable is reversed by GR modifications in the behaviors of
viscous stress and surface density over a significantly large annular region
not far from the innermost stable orbit at $r=\rms$. For slowly-rotating
central objects, this region spans a range of radii $14\lo r\lo 19$ in units of
the central object's mass $M$. For radiation pressure dominated (RPD) disks,
the Newtonian conclusion that they are viscously unstable remains valid after
including the above GR modifications, except in a very small annulus around
$r\approx 14M$, which has a negligible influence. Inclusion of the stabilizing
effect of the mass-inflow through the disk's inner edge via a GR analogue of
Roche-lobe overflow adds a small, stable region around \rms~for RPD disks, but
leaves GPD disks unchanged. We mention possible astrophysical relevance of
these results, particularly to the high-frequency X-ray variabilities observed

be constrained by analysis of the ""fast transient"" x-ray sources catalogued by
Pye and McHardy (1983) from the Ariel V survey as well as several other (e.g.
HEAO-A1/A2) surveys. After removing contamination from likely stellar

system is composed of exponentially-decreasing isothermal gas and magnetic
field (along the azimuthal direction) under a uniform gravity. The evolution of
the instability can be divided into three phases: linear, nonlinear, and
relaxed. During the linear phase, the perturbations grow exponentially with a
preferred scale along the azimuthal direction but with smallest possible scale
along the radial direction, as predicted from linear analyses. During the
nonlinear phase, the growth of the instability is saturated and flow motion
becomes chaotic. Magnetic reconnection occurs, which allows gas to cross field
lines. This, in turn, results in the redistribution of gas and magnetic field.
The system approaches a new equilibrium in the relaxed phase, which is
different from the one seen in two-dimensional works. The structures formed
during the evolution are sheet-like or filamentary, whose shortest dimension is
radial. Their maximum density enhancement factor relative to the initial value
is less than 2. Since the radial dimension is too small and the density
enhancement is too low, it is difficult to regard the Parker instability alone
as a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular clouds.

trade mainly through limit orders, watch markets closely, and move their limit
order prices frequently. We model these markets as a set of buyers and a set of
sellers diffusing in price space and interacting through an annihilation
interaction. We seek to compute the purely statistical effects of the presence
of large numbers of traders, as scaling laws on various measures of liquidity,
and to this end we allow our model very few parameters. We find that the
bid-offer spread scales as $\sqrt{1/{\rm Deal Rate}}$.In addition we
investigate the scaling of other intuitive relationships, such as the relation
between fluctuations of the best bid/offer and the density of buyers/sellers.
We then study this model and its scaling laws under the influence of random
disturbances to trader drift, trader volatility, and entrance rate. We also
study possible extensions to the model, such as the addition of market order
traders, and an interaction that models momentum-type trading. Finally, we
discuss how detailed simulations may be carried out to study scaling in all of
these settings, and how the models may be tested inactual markets.

order in QCD is essential to obtain a proper matching of the Wilson
coefficients to the matrix elements of local operators from lattice gauge
theory. The lifetime difference is reduced considerably at next-to-leading
order. We find $(\Delta\Gamma/\Gamma)_{B_s}=(f_{B_s}/210 MeV)^2 [0.006

next-to-leading order result for the mixing-induced CP asymmetry in inclusive
$b\to u\bar ud$ decays, which measures $\sin 2\alpha$.

which does not rely on low energy supersymmetry or technicolor. The fundamental
Planck mass is at a TeV and the observed weakness of gravity at long distances
is due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In this letter,
we study how the properties of black holes are altered in these theories. Small
black holes---with Schwarzschild radii smaller than the size of the new spatial
dimensions---are quite different. They are bigger, colder, and longer-lived
than a usual $(3+1)$-dimensional black hole of the same mass. Furthermore, they
primarily decay into harmless bulk graviton modes rather than standard-model
degrees of freedom. We discuss the interplay of our scenario with the
holographic principle. Our results also have implications for the bounds on the
spectrum of primordial black holes (PBHs) derived from the photo-dissociation
of primordial nucleosynthesis products, distortion of the diffuse gamma-ray
spectrum, overclosure of the universe, gravitational lensing, as well as the
phenomenology of black hole production. For example, the bound on the spectral
index of the primordial spectrum of density perturbations is relaxed from 1.25
to 1.45-1.60 depending on the epoch of the PBH formation. In these scenarios
PBHs provide interesting dark matter candidates; for 6 extra dimensions MACHO
candidates with mass $\sim 0.1M_\odot$ can arise. For 2 or 3 extra dimensions
PBHs with mass $\sim 2000 M_\odot$ can occur and may act as both dark matter
and seeds for early galaxy and QSO formation.

string vacua. We first consider the case of compact toroidal $Z_N$ Type IIB
orientifolds and then proceed to the non-compact case of Type IIB D3 branes at
orbifold and orientifold singularities. Unlike the case of the heterotic string
we find that for each given vacuum one has generically more than one U(1) with
non-vanishing triangle anomalies. There is a generalized Green-Schwarz
mechanism by which these anomalies are cancelled. This involves only the
Ramond-Ramond scalars coming from the twisted closed string spectrum but not
those coming from the untwisted sector. Associated to the anomalous U(1)'s
there are field-dependent Fayet-Illiopoulos terms whose mass scale is fixed by
undetermined vev's of the NS-NS partners of the relevant twisted RR fields.
Thus, unlike what happens in heterotic vacua, the masses of the anomalous
U(1)'s gauge bosons may be arbitrarily light. In the case of D3 branes at
singularities, appropriate factorization of the U(1)'s constrains the
Chan-Paton matrices beyond the restrictions from cancellation of non-abelian
anomalies. These conditions can be translated to constraints on the T-dual Type
IIB brane box configurations. We also construct a new large family of N=1
chiral gauge field theories from D3 branes at orientifold singularities, and
check its non-abelian and U(1) anomalies cancel.

phenomenon is studied for the physical situation of the nuclear spin system of
eight Xe atoms arranged on a magnetic surface along a chain. The oscillation
period is calculated as a function of the chain constant. The environmental
decoherence effects at finite temperature are accounted assuming a dipole
coupling between the spin chain and the fluctuating magnetic field of the
surface. The numerical calculations indicate that the oscillations are damped
by a rate $\sim (N-1)/ \tau$, where $N$ is the number of spins and $\tau$ is
the relaxation time of a single spin.
