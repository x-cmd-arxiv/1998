southern Zone of Avoidance with a multibeam receiver on the Parkes telescope.
This survey is eventually expected to catalog several thousand galaxies within
Galactic latitude |b|<5 degrees, mostly unrecognised before due to Galactic
extinction and confusion. We present here results of the first three detections
to have been imaged with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The
galaxies all lie near Galactic longitude 325 degrees and were selected because
of their large angular sizes, up to 1.3 degrees. Linear sizes range from 53 to
108 kpc. The first galaxy is a massive 5.7x10^11 solar mass disk galaxy with a
faint optical counterpart, SGC 1511.1--5249. The second is probably an
interacting group of galaxies straddling the Galactic equator. No optical
identification is possible. The third object appears to be an interacting pair
of low column density galaxies, possibly belonging to an extended Circinus or
Centaurus A galaxy group. No optical counterpart has been seen despite the
predicted extinction (A(B) = 2.7 - 4.4 mag) not being excessive. We discuss the
implications of the results, in particular the low HI column densities (~10^19
atoms/sq.cm) found for two of the three galaxies.

SBNs, are abnormally bright (in surface brightness), significantly more so than
even the brightest normal disks. Seyfert disks are also compact, but similar to
those in normal early-type spirals. For a given mass, Seyferts and especially
SBNs are abnormally rich in neutral hydrogen, and there is strong, albeit
indirect, evidence for lower mass-to-light (M/L) ratios in Seyfert and SBN
disks, but for normal M/Ls in their bulges. In Seyferts and SBNs, HI mass
fractions and M/L ratios are anticorrelated, and we attribute the high gas mass
fractions and low M/Ls in SBNs and several Seyferts to ongoing star formation.
Such abundant gas in Seyferts would be expected to inhibit bar formation, which
may explain why active galaxies are not always barred.

The one and two-particle excitations are analyzed by using a mapping of the
model onto a Bose gas of hard-core triplets. We find that low-lying singlet and
triplet two-particle bound states are present and their binding energy
increases with increasing frustration. In addition, many-particle bound states
are found by a combination of variational and exact diagonalization techniques.
We prove that the larger the number of bound quasiparticles the larger the
binding energy. Thus the excitation spectrum has a complex structure and
consists of elementary triplets and collective many-particle singlet and
triplet excitations which generally mix with the elementary ones.
  The model exhibits a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic
ladder phase (small frustration) into Haldane phase (effectively ferromagnetic
ladder for large frustration). We argue that near the transition point the
spectrum in both triplet and singlet channels becomes gapless. The excitation
wave function is dominated by large-size bound states which leads to the
vanishing of the quasiparticle residue.

by two position-dependent band parameters. Similarly for description of the
valence band kp-Hamiltonian the three Luttinger parameters are no longer
sufficient, and introducing of two additional parameters that determine
quadratic-in-k terms, and additional nonrelativistic linear-in-k term, is
necessary. The additional terms appear in kp-Hamiltonians due to interface
effective spin-orbit interaction and variation of the Bloch functions across
the interface. In the framework of this approach the two band hole

studied by using three different volumes, 8^3\cdot 24, 12^3\cdot 24 and

of loop production, massive radiation and friction to the energy loss processes
that are required for scaling evolution. We find that the loop distribution
statistics in the simulations are consistent with the long-time scaling of the
network being dominated by loop production. For an oscillating sinusoidal
perturbation, we also demonstrate that the power emitted into massive radiation
decays strongly with wavelength. Putting these observations together and
extrapolating, we believe there is insufficient evidence to reject the the
standard picture of string network evolution in favour of one where direct
massive radiation is the dominant decay mechanism, a proposal which has
attracted much recent interest.

non-holonomic constraint. It is unique among planimeters in that it measures
something more subtle than area, combining the area, centroid and other moments
of the region being measured, with weights depending on the length of the
planimeter. As a tool for measuring area, it is most accurate for regions that
are small relative to its length.
  The configuration space of the planimeter is a non-principal circle bundle
acted on by SU(1,1), (isom. to SL(2,R)). The motion of the planimeter is
realized as parallel translation for a connection on this bundle and for a
connection on a principal SU(1,1)-bundle. The holonomy group is SU(1,1). As a
consequence, the planimeter is an example of a system with a phase shift on the
circle that is not a simple rotation.
  There is a qualitative difference in the holonomy when tracing large regions
as opposed to small ones. Generic elements of SU(1,1) act on S^1 with two fixed
points or with no fixed points. When tracing small regions, the holonomy acts
without fixed points. Menzin's conjecture states (roughly) that if a planimeter
of length L traces the boundary of a region with area A > pi L^2, then it
exhibits an asymptotic behavior and the holonomy acts with two fixed points,
one attracting and one repelling. This is obvious if the region is a disk, and
intuitively plausible if the region is convex and A >> pi L^2. A proof of this
conjecture is given for a special case, and the conjecture is shown to imply
the isoperimetric inequality.

magnetic field which allows us to describe the mixing of the Landau orbitals of
the center of mass in terms of the electronic excitation and magnetic field.
The extent of quantum energy flow in the ion is investigated and a crossover
from localization to delocalization with increasing center of mass energy is
detected. It turns out that our model of the moving ion in a magnetic field is
closely connected to models for transport in disordered finite-size wires.

spatial and temporal variation of physical ``constants'' in the Universe.
Detection of high-redshift absorption systems intersecting the sight lines
towards distant quasars provide a powerful tool for measuring these variations.
We have previously demonstrated that high sensitivity to the variation of the
fine structure constant $\alpha$ can be obtained by comparing spectra of heavy
and light atoms (or molecules). Here we describe new calculations for a range
of atoms and ions, most of which are commonly detected in quasar spectra: Fe
II, Mg II, Mg I, C II, C IV, N~V, O I, Al III, Si II, Si IV, Ca I, Ca II, Cr
II, Mn II, Zn II, Ge II (see the results in Table 3). The combination of Fe II
and Mg II, for which accurate laboratory frequencies exist, have already been
used to constrain $\alpha$ variations. To use other atoms and ions, accurate
laboratory values of frequencies of the strong E1-transitions from the ground
states are required. We wish to draw the attention of atomic experimentalists
to this important problem.
  We also discuss a mechanism which can lead to a greatly enhanced sensitivity
for placing constraints on variation on fundamental constants. Calculations
have been performed for Hg II, Yb II, Ca I and Sr II where there are optical
transitions with the very small natural widths, and for hyperfine transition in
Cs I and Hg II.

anti-Stokes fields in a model of a cavity Raman laser, which leads to a
significant reduction in decoherence or quantum noise. The model comprises a
loss-less cavity with classical pump, unsaturated medium and arbitrary
homogeneous broadening and dispersion. Allowing for arbitrary linear
combinations of the two modes in the definition of quadrature variables, we
find that there always exists a combination of the two output modes which
exhibits quadrature squeezing with noise reduction below the vacuum level. The
number of noise photons for this combination mode is proportional to the square
root of the number of Stokes noise photons.

"quant-ph/9808025","Li Weigang","Li Weigang (U. of Brasilia)","A Study of Parallel Self-Organizing Map","27 pages, 9 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A Parallel Self-Organizing Map (Parallel-SOM) is proposed to modify Kohonen's
SOM in parallel computing environment. In this model, two separate layers of
neurons are connected together. The number of neurons in both layers and
connections between them is the product of the number of all elements of input
signals and the number of possible classification of the data. With this
structure the conventional repeated learning procedure is modified to learn
just once. The once learning manner is more similar to human learning and
memorizing activities. During training, weight updating is managed through a
sequence of operations among some transformation and operation matrices. Every
connection between neurons of input/output layers is considered as a
independent processor. In this way, all elements of the Euclidean distance
matrix and weight matrix are calculated simultaneously. The minimum distance of
every line of distance matrix can be found by Grover's search algorithm. This
synchronization feature improves the weight updating sequence significantly.
With a typical classification example, the convergence result demonstrates
efficient performance of Parallel-SOM. Theoretic analysis and proofs also show
some important properties of proposed model. Especially, the paper proves that
Parallel-SOM has the same convergence property as Kohonen's SOM, but the
complexity of former is reduced obviously.
