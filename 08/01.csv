are consistent with them being the central galaxies of the most massive dark
halos present at z~3. This conclusion holds in all currently popular
hierarchical models for structure formation, and is almost independent of the
global cosmological parameters. We examine whether the sizes, luminosities,
kinematics and star-formation rates of LBGs are also consistent with this
identification. Simple formation models tuned to give good fits to low redshift
galaxies can predict the distribution of these quantities in the LBG
population. The LBGs should be small (with typical half-light radii of 0.6-2
kpc/h), should inhabit haloes of moderately high circular velocity (180-290
km/s) but have low stellar velocity dispersions (70-120 km/s) and should have
substantial star formation rates (15-100 Msun/yr). The numbers here refer to
the predicted median values in the LBG sample of Adelberger et al. (1998); the
first assumes an Omega=1 universe and the second a flat universe with
Omega=0.3. For either cosmology these predictions are consistent with the
current (rather limited) observational data. Following the work of Kennicutt
(1998) we assume stars to form more rapidly in gas of higher surface density.
This predicts that LBG samples should preferentially contain objects with low
angular momentum, and so small size, for their mass. In contrast, samples of
damped Lyman alpha systems (DLSs), should be biased towards objects with large
angular momentum. Bright LBGs and DLSs may therefore form distinct populations,
with very different sizes and star formation rates, LBGs being smaller and more
metal-rich than DLSs of similar mass and redshift.

produces oblate iso-density contours. This suggests that the fundamental

improve this rate? Is it better to invest telescope time in more frequent
observations of the inner high surface-brightness fields, or in covering new,
less populated outer fields? How would a factor 2 improvement in CCD
sensitivity affect the detection efficiency? Would a series of major (factor
2--4) upgrades in telescope aperture, seeing, sky brightness, camera size, and
detector efficiency increase the event rate by a huge factor, or only
marginally? I develop a simplified framework to address these questions. With
observational resources fixed at the level of the MACHO and EROS experiments,
the biggest improvement (factor ~2) would come by reducing the time spent on
the inner ~25 deg^2 and applying it to the outer ~100 deg^2. By combining this
change with the characteristics of a good medium-size telescope (2.5 m mirror,
1"" point spread function, thinned CCD chips, 1 deg^2 camera, and dark sky), it
should be possible to increase the detection of LMC events to more than 100 per

5.'3. We have compared our photometry with theoretical isochrones appropriate
for Sextans A, in order to determine the ages of these populations. We have
mapped out the history of star formation, most accurately for times \lesssim
100 Myr. We find that star formation in Sextans A is correlated both in time
and space, especially for the most recent (\lesssim 12 Myr) times. The youngest
stars in the galaxy are forming primarily along the inner edge of the large H I
shell. Somewhat older populations, \lesssim 50 Myr, are found inward of the
youngest stars. Progressively older star formation, from \sim 50--100 Myr,
appears to have some spatially coherent structure and is more centrally
concentrated. The oldest stars we can accurately sample appear to have
approximately a uniform spatial distribution, which extends beyond a surface
brightness of \mu_B \simeq 25.9 mag arcsec^{-2} (or, a radius r \simeq 2.'3$).
Although other processes are also possible, our data provides support for a
mechanism of supernova-driven expansion of the neutral gas, resulting in cold
gas pileup and compression along the H I shell and sequential star formation in
recent times.

have calculated the two-point function of these sub-millimetre sources, using a
Poisson model normalized to the observed counts. While the current data are
uncertain, under reasonable assumptions the point-source contribution to the
anisotropy is comparable to the noise in the 353GHz channel. The clustering of
these sources is currently unknown, however if they cluster like the z~3

Planck frequency, 217GHz, the contribution from both the clustered and Poisson
terms are dramatically reduced. Hence we do not expect these sources to
seriously affect Planck's main science goal, the determination of the

frequency of electron-phonon scattering tends to diminish upon a decrease in
electron mean free path. It is found that the spin-orbit scattering rate
decreases with disorder. In our opinion, such unusual behavior can take place
for thin films at decreasing the electron mean free path provided, that the
surface electron scattering contributes significantly to the total spin-orbit
scattering.

topological liquids - correlated electronic systems with a spectral flow.
Compressible topological electronic liquids are superfluids.
  In this paper we present a study of a conventional model of a topological
superfluid in two spatial dimensions. This model is thought to be relevant to a
doped Mott insulator. We show how the spectral flow leads to the superfluid
hydrodynamics and how the Orthogonality Catastrophe affects off-diagonal matrix
elements. We also compute the major electronic correlation functions. Among
them are the spectral function, the pair wave function and various tunneling
amplitudes. To compute correlation functions we develop a method of current
algebra - an extension of the bosonization technique of one spatial dimension.
In order to emphasize a similarity between electronic liquids in one dimension
and topological liquids in dimensions greater than one, we first review the
Frohlich-Peierls mechanism of ideal conductivity in one dimension and then
extend the physics and the methods into two spatial dimension.

introduced in order to generate a soft region in the nuclear equation-of-state,
as suggested by recent lattice QCD calculations of baryon free matter at finite
temperature. Based on a hadronic transport model, we find that although this
equation-of-state has negligible effects on the inclusive hadronic spectra, it
leads to a minimum in the energy dependence of the transverse collective flow
and a delayed expansion of the compressed matter. In particular, the transverse
flow changes its direction as the colliding system passes through the softest
region in the equation-of-state.

some cluster emission processes. The interaction between the daughter and the
cluster is given by a double folding potential including quadrupole and
hexadecupole deformed densities of both fragments. The nuclear part of the
nucleus-nucleus interaction is density dependent and at small distances a
repulsive core in the potential will occur. In the frame of the
WKB-approximation the assault frequency of the cluster will depend on the
geometric properties of the potential pocket whereas the penetrability will be
sensitive to changes in the barrier location. The results obtained in this
paper point out that various combinations of cluster and daughter deformations
may account for the measured values of the decay rate.T he decay rather are
however more sensitive to the changes in the daughter deformation due to the
large mass asymmetry of the process.

of teleportation and the maximal singlet fraction $F_{max}$ attainable by means
of trace-preserving LQCC action (local quantum and classical communication).
For a given bipartite state acting on $C^d\otimes C^d$ we have $f_{max}=
{F_{max}d+1\over d+1}$. We assume completely general teleportation scheme
(trace preserving LQCC action over the pair and the third particle in unknown
state). The proof involves the isomorphism between quantum channels and a class
of bipartite states. We also exploit the technique of $U\otimes U^*$ twirling
states (random application of unitary transformation of the above form) and the
introduced analogous twirling of channels. We illustrate the power of the
theorem by showing that {\it any} bound entangled state does not provide better
fidelity of teleportation than for the purely classical channel. Subsequently,
we apply our tools to the problem of the so-called conclusive teleportation,
then reduced to the question of optimal conclusive increasing of singlet
fraction. We provide an example of state for which Alice and Bob have no chance
to obtain perfect singlet by LQCC action, but still singlet fraction
arbitrarily close to unity can be obtained with nonzero probability. We show
that a slight modification of the state has a threshold for singlet fraction
which cannot be exceeded anymore.
