  Astronomy and Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we report on the first simultaneous optical and X-ray
(Beppo-SAX) observations of the radio-quiet AGN 1H0419-577. The optical
spectrum clearly leads us to classify this source as a Seyfert 1. The X-ray
spectrum is, however, somewhat at odds with this classification: a simple flat
(Gamma ~ 1.55) and featureless power--law is a good description of the whole
1.8-40 keV spectrum, even if the upper limit to a broad iron line is not very
tight. An analysis of a still unpublished ROSAT observation of the same target
reveals that the soft X-ray spectrum has undergone a transition from a steep
(Gamma ~ 2.5) to a flat (Gamma ~ 1.55) state, at least in the 0.7-2 keV band.
If this difference is due to a remarkably variable soft excess, it is unlikely
that a single component is responsible for the optical/UV/soft X-ray spectral
distribution. The hypothesis that the difference is due to a change in the
primary X-ray continuum and its implications for current Comptonization models
are discussed.

(OTCM) which are moderately optically thin for absorption and we consider them

and that for $\xi \sim 500$ the model well reproduces the optical/UV/X-ray mean
quasar spectrum, in agreement with the estimates of the ionization parameter
based on the energy of the iron $K_{\alpha}$ line. We cannot definitively
reject synchrotron emission as a source of primary radiation but we favor the
model in which the hard X-ray emission is produced by Compton scattering of
soft photons in a central hot medium surrounded by cool clouds. In such a model
clouds are located typically at the distance of $\sim 12 R_{Schw}$, with the
covering factor about 0.88 and the radius of hot plasma is $\sim 9 R_{Schw}$.
The model explains optical/UV emission as predominantly due to the dark sides
of the clouds and the soft X-ray emission as due to the reflection by the
irradiated sides of the clouds. Therefore, atomic features are expected in
these bands although they are hardly present in the observational data. The
kinematical effects connected with the cloud motion affect those features but
do not remove them. The level of the primary emission required to model the
mean quasar spectrum is too low to reproduce the equivalent width of the iron

Namely, the matter falls into a black hole much the same way as water
disappears down a drain - matter goes in and nothing comes out. As this can
only happen in a black hole, it provides an unique way to see it. The accretion
proceeds almost in free fall close to the black hole horizon. In this paper we
calculate (by using Monte -Carlo simulations) the specific features of X-ray
spectra formed as a result of upscattering of the soft (disk) photons in the
converging inflow (CI) within about 3 Schwarzschild radii of the black hole.
The full relativistic treatment has been implemented to reproduce these
spectra. We show that spectra in the soft state of black hole systems can be
described as the sum of a thermal (disk) component and the convolution of some
fraction of this component with the CI upscattering spread function. The latter
boosted photon component is seen as an extended power-law at energies much
higher than the characteristic soft photons energy. We demonstrate the
stability of the power spectral index (alpha= 1.8) over a wide range of the
plasma temperature 0-10 keV and mass accretion rates (higher than 2 in
Eddington units). We also demonstrate that the sharp high energy cutoff occurs
at energies of 200-400 keV which are related to the average rest energy of
electrons impinging upon the horizon. The spectrum is practically identical to
the standard thermal Comptonization spectrum when the CI plasma temperature is
getting of order of 50 keV (hard state of BHS). Also, the change of spectral
shapes from the soft to the hard X-ray state is clearly to be related with the
temperature of the bulk flow. These Monte-Carlo simulated CI spectra are then a
inevitable stamp of the BHS.

perturbation theory to include corrections that are absent in linear theory. We
assume a local bias for the galaxies: i.e. the galaxy density is sampled from
some local function of the underlying mass distribution. We find that the
effect of the nonlinear bias in real space is to introduce two new features:
first, there is a contribution to the power which is constant with wavenumber,
whose nature we reveal as essentially a shot-noise term. In principle this
contribution can mask the primordial power spectrum, and could limit the
accuracy with which the latter might be measured on very large scales.
Secondly, the effect of second- and third-order bias is to modify the effective
bias (defined as the square root of the ratio of galaxy power spectrum to
matter power spectrum). The effective bias is almost scale-independent over a
wide range of scales. These general conclusions also hold in redshift space. In
addition, we have investigated the distortion of the power spectrum by peculiar
velocities, which may be used to constrain the density of the Universe. We look
at the quadrupole-to-monopole ratio, and find that higher-order terms can mimic
linear theory bias, but the bias implied is neither the linear bias, nor the
effective bias referred to above. We test the theory with biased N-body
simulations, and find excellent agreement in both real and redshift space,
providing the local biasing is applied on a scale whose fractional r.m.s.
density fluctuations are $< 0.5$.

than at earlier epochs, despite the fact that the comoving star formation rate
density of the universe was near its maximum value at this redshift. For three
of the four DLAs our observations include absorption lines of Si, Mn, Cr, Fe,

are consistent with a moderate degree of dust depletion which, once accounted
for, leaves no room for the enhancement of the alpha-elements over iron seen in
metal poor stars in the Milky Way. This is contrary to previous assertions that
DLAs have been enriched solely by Type II supernovae, but can be understood if
the rate of star formation in the systems studied proceeded more slowly than in
the early history of our Galaxy. These results add to a growing body of data
all pointing to the conclusion that known DLAs do not trace the galaxy
population responsible for the bulk of star formation. Possible reasons are
that sight-lines through metal rich gas are systematically underrepresented
because the background QSOs are reddened, and that the most actively star
forming galaxies are also the most compact, presenting too small a
cross-section to have been probed yet with the limited statistics of current
samples.

the continuum limit, finding the classical partition function is equivalent to
solving for the ground state of a Schrodinger-like equation obtained via the
transfer integral method. For the DSHG model, this equation turns out to be
quasi-exactly solvable. We exploit this property to obtain exact energy
eigenvalues and wavefunctions for several temperatures both above and below the
symmetry breaking transition temperature. The availability of exact results
provides an excellent testing ground for large scale Langevin simulations. The
probability distribution function (PDF) calculated from Langevin dynamics is
found to be in striking agreement with the exact PDF obtained from the ground

analytic continuation as well as analytical methods, we examine the one- and
two-particle dynamical properties of the Hubbard model on two coupled chains at

  The behavior of the single-particle spectral weight $A({\bf k},\omega)$ as a
function of hopping anisotropy $t_\perp/t$ at intermediate interaction strength
is dominated by the transition from one-band behavior at large $t_\perp/t$ to
two-band behavior at small $t_\perp/t$, although interaction effects such as
band-narrowing, a shift of spectral weight to higher energies in the unoccupied
antibonding band and reflected structures due to short-range antiferromagnetic
correlations are also present. A single-particle gap is resolved in the
intermediate $t_\perp/t$ Luther-Emery phase using Density Matrix
Renormalization Group calculations.
  The dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities show features of the expected
bonding-band Luttinger liquid behavior, as well as higher-energy features due
to local excitations between the chains at large $t_\perp/t$, and evolve
towards the behavior of two uncoupled chains as $t_\perp/t$ is reduced. For the
one hole, large $t_\perp/t$ case, we make a detailed comparison between the QMC
data and an approximation based on local rung states.
  At isotropic coupling and somewhat larger doping, we find that the dispersion
of the single-particle bands is essentially unrenormalized from that of the
noninteracting system, and that the spin and charge response functions have
features also seen in random-phase-approximation calculations.

the wavefunction exhibits sharp fronts. These ballistic fronts yield an
anomalous time dependence of the $q$-th moment of the local probability
density, or dynamical participation number of order $q$, with a non-trivial
exponent $\tau(q)$ for $q>2$. This striking feature is interpreted as
bifractality. A heuristic treatment of the localised regime demonstrates a
similar anomalous scaling, but with the correlation length $\xi_0$ near the
band center replacing time. The moments of the position of the particle are not
affected by the fronts, and they exhibit normal scaling. The crossover
behaviour of all these quantities between the ballistic and the localised

capacity for a steady turnover of their structures. Both of these material
properties, i.e. recovery of the shape after an external stress has been
imposed and dynamic structural reorganization, are essential for many cellular
phenomena. Examples are mechanical properties of tissue, cell motility, cell
growth and division, and active intracellular transport. Numerous experiments
in vivo and in vitro have shown that the structural element responsible for the
extraordinary mechanical and dynamical properties of eukaryotic cells is the
cytoskeleton, a three-dimensional assembly of protein fibers such as actin
filaments and microtubules. In addition to those biopolymers various proteins
with structural and regulatory functions have a major influence on the
mechanical properties. At the relevant length-scales (a few microns at most)
the building blocks of these biomaterials are very different from conventional
polymeric material. In contrast to flexible polymers the persistence length is
of the same order of magnitude as their total contour length or even larger.
This implies that the physics of such a system is determined by a subtle
interplay between energetic and entropic contributions. We review our present
understanding of the physics of biopolymers using concepts from macromolecular
and statistical physics complemented by computer simulation. These systems open
up a new field of soft condensed matter research, which to date is only poorly
understood but has a great potential for interesting new physical phenomena.

computed observables (zenith bins). First we study how such observables vary
with the oscillation parameters, and then we perform a fit to the experimental
data as measured in SK for an exposure of 33 kTy (535 days). In the two-flavor
mixing case, we confirm the results of the SK Collaboration analysis, namely,
that \nu_\mu<--->\nu_\tau oscillations are preferred over \nu_\mu<--->\nu_e,
and that the no oscillation case is excluded with high confidence. In the
three-flavor mixing case, we perform our analysis with and without the
additional constraints imposed by the CHOOZ reactor experiment. In both cases,
the analysis favors a dominance of the \nu_\mu<--->\nu_\tau channel. Without
the CHOOZ constraints, the amplitudes of the subdominant \nu_\mu<--->nu_e and
\nu_e<--->\nu_\tau transitions can also be relatively large, indicating that,
at present, current SK data do not exclude sizable \nu_e mixing by themselves.
After combining the CHOOZ and SK data, the amplitudes of the subdominant
transitions are constrained to be smaller, but they can still play a
nonnegligible role both in atmospheric and other neutrino oscillation searches.
In particular, we find that the \nu_e appearance probability expected in long

consideration of the zero mode $ k^+ = 0 $ is not sufficient for investigating
dynamical symmetry breaking on the LF. It also needs to treat properly an
infrared divergence caused by internal momentum $ p^+ \to 0 ~ (p^+ \neq 0) $ in
the continuum limit. In order to avoid the divergence, we introduce an infrared
cutoff function $ F_{\rm IR} (p, \Lambda) $ which is not Lorentz invariant. It
is then shown that the gauge boson obtains mass dynamically on the LF.

barrier. We evaluate numerically the correction to the potential in dependence
on the size of the barrier and on the barrier-sources distance.

it follows that the generating functions are Jacobi forms. In particular the
generating functions for the Euler numbers have a similar transformation
behaviour under SL(2,Z) as that predicted in Vafa and Witten: A strong coupling
test of S-duality. In addition we get that also the generating functions for
the signatures can be expressed in terms of modular forms. Finally it turns out
that the generating function for the signatures is also (with respect to
another developping parameter) the generating function for the Donaldson

form. This space has a natural stratification that changes as the cohomology
class of the form changes and whose properties are very closely connected to
the topology of the group of symplectomorphisms of $S^2\times S^2$.
  By globalizing standard gluing constructions in the theory of stable maps, we
show that the strata of $\Jj$ are Fr\'echet manifolds of finite codimension,
and that the normal link of each stratum is a finite dimensional stratified
space. The topology of these links turns out to be surprisingly intricate, and
we work out certain cases. Our arguments apply also to other ruled surfaces,
though they give complete information only for bundles over $S^2$ and $T^2$.

the proxy of domain wall length. We find that the energy and domain wall length
