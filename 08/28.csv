proven rather difficult to simulate. Further, 2-dimensional simulations have
suggested a breakdown of self-similar scaling for spectra with n<-1 due to
divergent contributions from the coupling of long wave modes. This paper is the
second (numerical) part of our investigation into the nonlinear gravitational
clustering of scale-free spectra. Using high-resolution N-body simulations we
find that the n=-2 power spectrum, as well as trajectories of the amplitude and
phase of Fourier modes, display self-similar scaling. The evolution of the
phase shift does show a different scaling at late times, but this was shown
analytically to arise from the purely kinematical effect of bulk flows. Thus
our analytical and N-body results verify that self-similarity in gravitational
clustering holds for -3<n<1. The N-body spectrum is also compared with analytic
fitting formulae, which are found to slightly underestimate the power in the
nonlinear regime. The asymptotic shape of the spectrum at high-k is a power law
with the same slope as predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis.

photoionization in the, X-ray discovered, ionized absorbers in Seyfert
galaxies. These absorbers show temporal changes inconsistent with simple
equilibrium models. We develop a simple code to follow the temporal evolution
of non-equilibrium photoionized gas. As a result several effects appear that
are easily observable; and which, in fact, may explain otherwise paradoxical
behavior.
  Specifically we find that: 1) In many important astrophysical conditions pure
collisional and photoionization equilibria can be distinguished with moderate
spectral resolution observations, due to a strong absorption structure between
1 and 3 keV. 2) In time-evolving non-equilibrium photoionization models the
response of the ionization state of the gas to sudden changes of the ionizing
continuum is smoothed and delayed at low gas densities, even when the
luminosity increases. 3) If the changes of the ionizing luminosity are not
instantaneous, and the electron density is low enough (the limit depends on the
average ionization state of the gas), the ionization state of the gas can
continue to increase while the source luminosity decreases, so a maximum in the
ionization state of a given element may occur during a minimum of the ionizing
intensity (the opposite of the prediction of equilibrium models). 4) Different
ions of different elements reach their equilibrium configuration on different
time-scales.
  These properties are similar to those seen in several ionized absorbers in
AGN, properties which had hitherto been puzzling. We applied these models to a
high S/N ROSAT PSPC observation of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051.

in lensing high-redshift QSOs. We find that the lens models using updated
Schechter parameters for such galaxies, derived from the recent redshift
surveys combined with morphological classification, are found to give smaller
lensing probabilities than earlier calculated. Inconsistent adoption of these
parameters from a mixture of various galaxy surveys gives rise to systematic
biases in the results. We also show that less compact dwarf-type galaxies which
largely dominate the faint part of the Schechter-form luminosity function
contribute little to lensing probabilities, so that earlier lens models
overestimate incidents of small separation lenses. Applications of the lens
models to the existing lens surveys indicate that reproduction of both the
lensing probability of optical sources and the image separations of optical and
radio lenses is significantly improved in the revised lens models. The
likelihood analyses allow us to conclude that a flat universe with
Omega=0.3(+0.2-0.1) and Omega+Lambda=1 is most preferable, and a

pulsation unlikely. The mode changes occur on a timescale of about 1000 d,
which is too rapid be related to a change in the overall thermal structure of
the star and may instead be related to weak chaos.

The overriding picture is one of homogeneity, implying a remarkable uniformity
in the formation of these galaxies. This picture contrasts with the increasing
activity seen in clusters as a function of redshift, creating an apparent
paradox been the obvious diversity of star formation histories in distant
cluster galaxies and their uniformity in local systems. A resolution is
feasible so long as star formation occurs over an extended epoch.
  In addition to placing limits on variations in star formation history the
existence of a tight `fundamental relations', such as the colour-magnitude
relation, can be used to investigate galaxy mergers and to set limits on the
degree to which present-day clusters galaxies are built by combining systems of
stars formed in smaller units. The final part of this talk turns to early-type
galaxies in the field, and tries to apply the same techniques that have been
successful in clusters. This is an emerging field in which appropriate
data-sets are only just becoming available; however, comparison of the
formation histories of galaxies in a wide variety of environments is key to
distinguishing between the Classical and Hierarchical models for galaxy

the nucleus, and consists of gas complexes that are unlikely to be
gravitationally bound. The CO kinematics within the bar consist of two separate
components. A kinematically distinct circumnuclear disk, < 500 pc in diameter,
is undergoing predominantly circular motion with a maximum rotational velocity
of 245 km/s at a radius of 1 arcsec (160 pc). The CO-emitting gas in the bar
outside the circumnuclear disk has substantial noncircular motions which are
consistent with a large radial velocity component, directed inwards. The CO
emission has a large velocity gradient across the bar dust lane, ranging from
0.5 to 1.9 km/s/pc after correcting for inclination, and the projected velocity
change across the dust lane is as high as 200 km/s. This sharp velocity
gradient is consistent with a shock front at the location of the bar dust lane.
A comparison of H-alpha and CO kinematics across the dust lane shows that
although the H-alpha emission is often observed both upstream and downstream
from the dust lane, the CO emission is observed only where the velocity
gradient is large. We also compare the observations with hydrodynamic models

parameter. In the non-conserved case, the scaling form for the correlation
function and it's Fourier transform, the structure factor, is established, with
the characteristic length growing as a power of time. In the conserved case,
the structure factor is evaluated and found to exhibit a multi-scaling
behaviour, with two growing length scales differing by a logarithmic factor. In
both cases, the rate of growth of the length scales depends on the manner in
which the mobility or kinetic coefficient vanishes as the magnitude of the
order parameter approaches its equilibrium value.

that the mean-field ground state consists of a condensate of spin-singlets
along the rungs of the ladder. We generalize this approach to larger
angular-momentum coupled bases which incorporate---by their mere definition---a
substantial fraction of the important short-range structure of these materials.
In these bases the mean-field ground-state remains a condensate of spin
singlet---but now with each involving a larger fraction of the spins in the
ladder. As expected, the ``purity'' of the ground-state, as judged by the
condensate fraction, increases with the size of the elementary block defining
the basis. Moreover, the coupling to quasiparticle excitations becomes weaker
as the size of the elementary block increases. Thus, the weak-coupling limit of
the theory becomes an accurate representation of the underlying mean-field
dynamics. We illustrate the method by computing static and dynamic properties
of two-leg ladders in the various angular-momentum coupled bases.

arguments and a functional renormalization group technique. Our analysis
applies to elastic manifolds, e.g., interfaces, as well as to periodic elastic
media, e.g., charge-density waves or flux-line lattices. The competition
between both pinning mechanisms leads to a continuous, disorder driven
roughening transition between a flat state where the mean relative displacement
saturates on large scales and a rough state with diverging relative
displacement. The transition can be approached by changing the impurity
concentration or, indirectly, by tuning the temperature since the pinning
strengths of the random and crystal potential have in general a different
temperature dependence. For D dimensional elastic manifolds interacting with
either random-field or random-bond disorder a transition exists for 2<D<4, and
the critical exponents are obtained to lowest order in \epsilon=4-D. At the
transition, the manifolds show a superuniversal logarithmic roughness. Dipolar
interactions render lattice effects relevant also in the physical case of D=2.
For periodic elastic media, a roughening transition exists only if the ratio p
of the periodicities of the medium and the crystal lattice exceeds the critical
value p_c=6/\pi\sqrt{\epsilon}. For p<p_c the medium is always flat. Critical
exponents are calculated in a double expansion in \mu=p^2/p_c^2-1 and
\epsilon=4-D and fulfill the scaling relations of random field models.

estimates for six noise curves: LIGO (three configurations), VIRGO, GEO600, and
TAMA. To search for binaries with components more massive than 0.2M_o while
losing no more than 10% of events due to coarseness of template spacing,
initial LIGO will require about 1*10^11 flops (floating point operations per
second) for data analysis to keep up with data acquisition. This is several
times higher than estimated in previous work by Owen, in part because of the
improved family of templates and in part because we use more realistic (higher)
sampling rates. Enhanced LIGO, GEO600, and TAMA will require computational
power similar to initial LIGO. Advanced LIGO will require 8*10^11 flops, and

sphere into the Grassmannian. Correlators obtained on the Grassmannain are a
first step generalization of the Schubert formula for the self-intersection.
The intersection numbers on the moduli space for r=2,3 are given explicitly by
two closed formulas, when r=2 the intersection numbers, are found to generate
the alternate Fibonacci numbers, the Pell numbers and in general a random walk
of a particle on a line with absorbing barriers. For r=3 the intersection

gauge theories, which extends previous approaches to include non-conformal
theories. We consider Liouville field theory on world sheets whose boundaries
are the Wilson loops of gauge theory, which exhibit vortex and spike defects.
We show that world-sheet vortex condensation occurs when the Wilson loop is
embedded in four target space-time dimensions, and show that this corresponds
to the condensation of gauge magnetic monopoles in target space. We also show
that vortex condensation generates a effective string tension corresponding to
the confinement of electric degrees of freedom. The tension is independent of
the string length in a gauge theory whose electric coupling varies
logarithmically with the length scale. The Liouville field is naturally
interpreted as an extra target dimension, with an anti-de-Sitter (AdS)
structure induced by recoil effects on the gauge monopoles, interpreted as D
branes of the effective string theory. Black holes in the bulk AdS space
correspond to world-sheet defects, so that phases of the bulk gravitational
system correspond to the different world-sheet phases, and hence to different
phases of the four-dimensional gauge theory. Deconfinement is associated with a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of vortices on the Wilson-loop world
sheet, corresponding in turn to a phase transition of the black holes in the
bulk AdS space.

of concrete physical realizations. Within the RPI approach it is demonstrated
that for appropriately adjusted fuzziness, information about the evolution of
the state of the system can be read off from the measurement readout E(t). It
is shown furthermore how a measurement of this type may be realized by a series
of weak and short interactions of the two-level system with a quantum
mechanical meter system. After each interaction a macroscopic measuring
apparatus causes the meter to transit into one of two states. The result is
used to generate the energy readout E(t). In this way a complete agreement with
the RPI approach is demonstrated which thus obtains an operational
interpretation.
