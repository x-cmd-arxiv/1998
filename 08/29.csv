We report the discovery of a near-infrared counterpart to the nuclear ring of
radio emission in NGC 7771. A displacement between the ~10 radio bright clumps
and the ~10 near-infrared bright clumps indicates the presence of multiple
generations of star formation. The estimated thermal emission from each radio
source is equivalent to that of ~35000 O6 stars. Each near-infrared bright knot
contains ~5000 red supergiants, on average. The stellar mass of each knot is
estimated to be ~10^7 M_sun. The implied time-averaged star formation rate is
\~40 M_sun per yr. Several similarities are found between the properties of
this system and other ringed and non-ringed starbursts. Morphological
differences between NGC 7771 and the starburst + Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 7469
suggest that NGC 7771 may not be old enough to fuel an AGN, or may not be
capable of fueling an AGN. Alternatively, the differences may be unrelated to
the presence or absence of an AGN and may simply reflect the possibility that
star formation in rings is episodic.

luminosity occurs within a certain finite interval, bounded at both ends, with
the interval varying for different observations. Nonparametric methods for the

extend some known techniques for data that is only truncated on one side, in
particular Lynden-Bell's estimator and the truncated version of Kendall's tau

an undiscovered central pulsar. The thermal component has a temperature of
about 0.4 keV. We attribute it to the emission from the shock-heat swept-up

the observed thermal component. Some charactistics about the synchrotron nebula

supersymmetry-breaking parameters, we investigate the infrared behaviour of the
softly broken supersymmetric QCD as well as its dual theory in the conformal
window. Under general assumptions on $\beta$-functions, it is shown that the
soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters asymptotically vanish in the infrared
limit so that superconformal symmetry in softly broken supersymmetric QCD and
in its dual theory revives at the infrared fixed point, provided the soft
scalar masses satisfy certain renormalization group invariant relations. If
these relations are not satisfied, there exist marginal operators in both
theories that lead to the breaking of supersymmetry and also colour symmetry.

the edge excitations of the hierarchical plateaus in the quantum Hall effect.
In this paper, these models are described in very explicit terms by using a
bosonic Fock space with constraints, or, equivalently, with a non-trivial
Hamiltonian. The Fock space is that of the multi-component Abelian conformal
theories, which provide another possible description of the hierarchical
plateaus; in this space, the minimal models are shown to correspond to the
sub-set of states which satisfy the constraints. This reduction of degrees of
freedom can also be implemented by adding a relevant interaction to the
Hamiltonian, leading to a renormalization-group flow between the two theories.
Next, a physical interpretation of the constraints is obtained by representing
the quantum incompressible Hall fluids as generalized Fermi seas. Finally, the
non-Abelian statistics of the quasi-particles in the W-infinity minimal models
is described by computing their correlation functions in the Coulomb Gas
approach.

(real) link is rational homology sphere, the Artin--Laufer program can be
continued. Here we give the complete answer in the case of elliptic
singularities. The main result of the paper says that in the case of an
elliptic Gorenstein singularity whose link is rational homology sphere, the
geometric genus is a topological invariant. Actually, it is exactly the length
of the elliptic sequence in the minimal resolution (or, equivalently, in S.
S.-T. Yau's terminology: these singularities are maximally elliptic). In the
paper we characterize the singularities with this property, and we compute
their Hilbert-Samuel function from their resolution graph (generalizing some
results of Laufer and Yau). The obstruction for a normal surface singularity to
be maximally elliptic can be connected with the torsion part of some Picard
groups, this is the new idea of the paper.

these techniques by studying surgery along alternating links.
