background anisotropies, and discuss the qualitative features of these effects.
New couplings of the baryonic velocity to radiation multipoles are found,
arising from nonlinear Thomson scattering effects. We also find a new nonlinear
shear effect on small angular scales. The full set of evolution and constraint
equations is derived, including the nonlinear generalizations of the radiation
multipole hierarchy, and of the dynamics of multi-fluids. These equations
govern radiation anisotropies in any inhomogeneous spacetime, but their main
application is to second-order effects in a universe that is close to the
Friedmann models. Qualitative analysis is given here, and quantitative
calculations are taken up in further papers.

magnetic susceptibiliy of NaV_2O_5 in the microwave and far infrared frequency
ranges. The anomalies occur at the phase transition temperature T_c, at which
the spin gap opens. The real parts of the dielectric constants epsilon_a and
epsilon_c decrease below T_c. The decrease of epsilon_a (except for the narrow
region close to T_c) is proportional to the intensity of the x-ray reflection
appearing at T_c. The dielectric constant anomaly can be explained by the
zigzag charge ordering in the ab-plane appearing below T_c. The anomaly of the
microwave magnetic losses is probably related to the coupling between the spin
and charge degrees of freedom in vanadium ladders.

used to investigate how adding electrons to a quantum dot alters or ""scrambles""
its electronic spectrum. Deviations from finite-temperature random matrix
theory with an unchanging spectrum indicate spectral scrambling after a small
number of electrons are added. Enhanced peak-to-peak correlations at low
temperature are observed. Peak height statistics show similar behavior in
several dot configurations despite significant differences in correlations.

by the probabilistic interpretation of the latter. In the case of non-forward

the evolution equation.

"math/9808069",,"Eduardo Esteves","Linear systems and ramification points on reducible nodal curves","AMS-TeX, 11 pages, to appear in Matematica Contemporanea",,,,"math.AG",,"  In the 80's D. Eisenbud and J. Harris developed the general theory of limit
linear series, Invent. math. 85 (1986), in order to understand what happens to
linear systems and their ramification points on families of non-singular curves
degenerating to curves of compact type. They applied their theory to the study
of limits of Weierstrass points, among other endeavours. In one of their
articles, Invent. math. 87 (1987), they asked: ""What are the limits of
Weierstrass points in families of curves degenerating to stable curves not of
compact type?"" In this eprint we address this question within a more general
framework. More precisely, given a family of linear systems on a family of
non-singular curves degenerating to a nodal curve we give a formula for the
limit of the associated ramification divisors in terms of certain limits of the
family of linear systems. In contrast with the theory of limit linear series of
Eisenbud's and Harris', we do not need to blow up the family to swerve the
degenerating ramification points away from the nodes of the limit curve.
Indeed, we can assign the adequate weight to the limit ramification divisor at
any point of the limit curve. In a forthcoming submission we shall deal with
the specific question of limits of Weierstrass points, assuming certain generic
conditions.

  high-energy A+A collisions in the parton-cascade model","4 pages including 2 postscript figures",,,,"nucl-th",,"  In view of the recent WA98 data of pi0 spectra from central Pb+Pb collisions
at the CERN SPS, we analyze the production of neutral pions for A+$ collisions
across the periodic table at sqrt(s)=17 AGeV and 200 AGeV within the framework
of the parton-cascade model for relativistic heavy ion collisions. The
multiplicity of the pions (having pT > 0.5 GeV/c) in the central rapidity
region, is seen to scale as \sim (N_part)^alpha, where N_part$ is the number of
participating nucleons, which we have approximated as 2A for central collisions
of identical nuclei. We argue that the deviation of \alpha (\simeq 1.2) from
unity may have its origin in the multiple scattering suffered by the partons.
We also find that the constant of proportionality in the above scaling relation
increases substantially in going from SPS to RHIC energies. This would imply
that the (semi)hard partonic activity becomes a much cleaner signal above the
soft particle production at the higher energy of RHIC, and thus much less
dependent on the (lack of) understanding of the underlying soft physics
background.

elements has been developed. A fast gas valve, a nozzle, and a skimmer are used
to generate an ultrasonic gas beam that is injected into a planar-geometry
microsecond plasma-opening-switch (POS). An array of ionization probes with
relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions was developed for diagnosing
the absolute injected-gas density and its spatial profile. The properties of
the gas column were also studied using spectroscopy of line emission that
results from the interaction of the doped gas with the POS prefilled plasma.
The doped column is found to have a width of ~1 cm and a density of
(0.8-1.7)*10^14 cm-3. Observations of characteristic emission lines from the
doped atoms and their ions allow for various spectroscopic measurements, such
as the magnetic field from Zeeman splitting and the ion velocity distributions
from Doppler shifts, that are local in three dimensions. It is shown that this
gas doping technique can also be used to study proton-dominated plasmas that
cannot be studied with simple emission spectroscopy due to the lack of light
emitting ions. The variety of gases used with this method, together with the
small valve dimensions and its fast opening, make it potentially useful for
broad diagnostics of various short-duration plasma experiments.
