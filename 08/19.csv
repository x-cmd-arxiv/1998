a stochastic system can be transmitted to macroscopic evolution of the system
as a whole. Within the Markov approximation widely using in ordinary
statistical mechanics, memory effects are neglected. As a result, a time-scale
separation between the macroscopic and the microscopic level of description
exists, the macroscopic differential picture is no a consequence of microscopic
non-differentiable dynamics. On the other hand, the presence of complete memory
in a system means that all its components have the same behaviour. If the
memory function has no characteristic time scales, the correct description of
the macroscopic evolution of such systems have to be in terms of the fractional
calculus.

  We propose a cooperative mechanism of self-regulation by which the system as

of each element to the corresponding small piece of the information on the

magnifying and distorting the images of background galaxies. A comparison of
different mass estimators among these clusters can provide useful information
about the distribution and composition of cluster matter and their dynamical
evolution. Using a hitherto largest sample of lensing clusters drawn from
literature, we compare the gravitating masses of clusters derived from the
strong/weak gravitational lensing phenomena, from the X-ray measurements based
on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, and from the conventional
isothermal sphere model for the dark matter profile characterized by the
velocity dispersion and core radius of galaxy distributions in clusters. While
there is an excellent agreement between the weak lensing, X-ray and isothermal
sphere model determined cluster masses, these methods are likely to
underestimate the gravitating masses enclosed within the central cores of
clusters by a factor of 2--4 as compared with the strong lensing results. Such
a mass discrepancy has probably arisen from the inappropriate applications of
the weak lensing technique and the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis to the
central regions of clusters as well as an unreasonably large core radius for
both luminous and dark matter profiles. Nevertheless, it is pointed out that
these cluster mass estimators may be safely applied on scales greater than the
core sizes. Namely, the overall clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshift
can still be regarded as the dynamically relaxed systems, in which the velocity
dispersion of galaxies and the temperature of X-ray emitting gas are good
indicators of the underlying gravitational potentials of clusters.

reveals the following features: (1)The cluster baryon fraction indeed shows an
increasing tendency towards a value of $\sim30%$ at large cluster radius;
(2)The dynamical cluster masses are in fairly good agreement with the masses
determined by weak lensing technique; (3)The cluster masses provided by strong
lensing and other methods are essentially consistent within a factor of
$\sim2$. (4)The cluster $\sigma-T$ relationship is in concordance with the
scenario that overall galaxy clusters are the well relaxed dynamical systems.
These results are strongly suggestive of a low-mass density universe
($\Omega_m<0.3$), in which the fraction of baryonic matter ($\sim30%$) is not

intracluster gas and the optical measured velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the

robust test for the dynamical properties of galaxy clusters. Here, we present
the $\sigma$-$T$ relationship using the 94 clusters drawn from the largest
sample of 149 clusters in literature, for which both $\sigma$ and $T$ are
observationally determined. Employment of the doubly weighted orthogonal
distance regression to our sample yields
$\sigma=10^{2.47\pm0.06}T^{0.67\pm0.09}$, indicating an apparent deviation of
dynamical state from that predicted by the isothermal and hydrostatic
equilibrium model for galaxy clusters, though the average ratio $\beta_{spec}$
of specific energy in galaxies to that in gas is found to be in excellent
agreement with unity. It shows that a nonisothermal gas distribution with a

effect and the X-ray emission observations can be used to determine the angular
diameter distance to galaxy clusters, from which the Hubble constant is
derived. The present values of the Hubble constant derived through the SZ/X-ray
route have a broad distribution ranging from 30 to 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. We show
that this broad distribution is primarily due to the projection effect of
aspherical clusters, which have been modeled using spherical geometries. The
projection effect is also expected to broaden the measured gas mass fraction of
galaxy clusters. However, the projection effect either under- or overestimate
the Hubble constant and the gas mass fraction in an opposite manner, producing
an anticorrelation. Using the published data for SZ/X-ray clusters, we show
that the current Hubble constant distribution is negatively correlated with the
measured gas mass fraction for same clusters, suggesting that the projection
effects are present in current results. If the gas mass fraction of galaxy
clusters, when measured out to an outer hydrostatic radius is constant, it may
be possible to account for the line of sight geometry of galaxy clusters.
However, to perform such an analysis, an independent measurement of the total
mass of galaxy clusters, such as from weak lensing, is needed. Using the weak
lensing, optical velocity dispersion, SZ and X-ray data, we outline an
alternative method to calculate the Hubble constant, which is subjected less to
projection effects than the present method based on only the SZ and X-ray data.
For A2163, the Hubble constant based on published SZ, X-ray and weak lensing
observations is \sim 49 \pm 29 km s^-1 Mpc^-1.

to align with the spin of the hole by the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Assuming
that any jet produced by such a system is aligned with the angular momentum of
either the hole or the inner disk, this can, in principle provide a mechanism
for producing steady jets in AGN whose direction is independent of the angular
momentum of the accreted material. However, the torque which aligns the inner
disk with the hole, also, by Newton's third law, tends to align the spin of the
hole with the outer accretion disk. In this letter, we calculate this alignment
timescale for a black hole powering an AGN, and show that it is relatively
short. This timescale is typically much less than the derived ages for jets in
radio loud AGN, and implies that the jet directions are not in general
controlled by the spin of the black hole. We speculate that the jet directions
are most likely controlled either by the angular momentum of the accreted
material or by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy.

corresponding to the optically identified superbubbles Shell 1 and Shell 2. The
HI gas associated with Shell 1 shows an expansion pattern similar to that of
the ionized gas shell, but the mass and kinetic energy of the HI shell are 3--7
times those of the ionized gas shell. The total kinetic energy of the neutral

in a pressure-driven superbubble. It is possible that the central OB
association was formed in a molecular cloud and a visible superbubble was not
fully developed until the ambient molecular gas had been dissociated and
cleared away. This hypothesis is supported by the existence of a molecular

between the jet and the ambient medium 3-10, and ambient Mach number ~ 24),
these simulations are also compared with baseline non-magnetic and adiabatic
calculations. We find that, after amplification by compression and
re-orientation in nonparallel shocks at the working surface, the magnetic field
that is carried backward with the shocked gas into the cocoon improves the jet
collimation relative to the purely hydrodynamic (HD) systems. Low-amplitude,
approximately equally spaced internal shocks (which are absent in the HD
systems) are produced by MHD K-H reflection pinch modes. The longitudinal field
geometry also excites non-axisymmetric helical modes which cause some beam
wiggling. The strength and amount of these modes are, however, reduced (by ~
twice) in the presence of radiative cooling relative to the adiabatic cases.
Besides, a large density ratio between the jet and the ambient medium also
reduces, in general, the number of the internal shocks. As a consequence, the
weakness of the induced internal shocks makes it doubtful that the magnetic
pinches could produce by themselves the bright knots observed in the overdense,
radiatively cooling protostellar jets.

function for observed galactic disks is presented and illustrated. Under the
assumption that these disks are axi-symmetric and thin, the proposed method
yields the unique distribution compatible with all the observables available.
The derivation may be carried out from the measurement of the azimuthal
velocity distribution arising from positioning the slit of a spectrograph along
the major axis of the galaxy. More generally, it may account for the
simultaneous measurements of velocity distributions corresponding to slits
presenting arbitrary orientations with respect to the major axis. The approach
is non-parametric, i.e. it does not rely on a particular algebraic model for
the distribution function. Special care is taken to account for the fraction of
counter-rotating stars which strongly affects the stability of the disk. An
optimisation algorithm is devised -- generalising the work of Skilling & Bryan
(1984) -- to carry this truly two-dimensional ill-conditioned inversion
efficiently. The performances of the overall inversion technique with respect
to the noise level and truncation in the data set is investigated with
simulated data. Reliable results are obtained up to a mean signal to noise
ratio of~5 and when measurements are available up to $4 R_{e}$. A discussion of
the residual biases involved in non parametric inversions is presented.
Prospects of application to observed galaxies and other inversion problems are
discussed.

how the grain boundaries contribute actively to the deformation. At grain sizes
below 10-15 nm deformation in the grain boundaries dominate over the

positive energy states are empty. The boson states are divided into two sectors
; the usual positive sector with positive and zero numbers of bosons and the
negative sector with negative numbers of bosons. Once it comes into the
negative sector it cannot return to the usual positive sector by ordinary

approach extremality we found that all fields of the vortex are expelled from
the extreme black hole. In the thin string limit we obtained the metric of a
conical electrically charged dilaton black hole. The effect of the vortex can
be measured from infinity justifying its characterization as black hole hair.

self interaction models of Barut and Bracken, Hestenes, Chacko and others and
provides a unified picture which amongst other things gives a rationale for and
an insight into: 1. The apparently inexplicable reason why complex space-time
transformations lead to the Kerr-Newman metric in General Relativity. 2. The
value of the fine structure constant. 3. The ratio between electromagnetic and
gravitational interaction strengths. 4. The anomalous gyromagnetic ratio for
the electron. 5. Why the neutrino is left-handed. 6. Why the charge is
discrete. In the spirit of Effective Field Theories, this model provides an
alternative formalism for Quantum Theory and also for its combination with
General Relativity. Finally a mechanism for the formation of these QMBH or
particles is explored within the framework of Stochastic Electrodynamics, QED
and Quantum Statistical Mechanics. The cosmological implications are then
examined. It turns out that a surprisingly large number of facts, including
some which were hitherto inexplicable, follow as a consequence of the model.

temperature, even though the thermal fluctuations are absent, quantum fields
still possess vacuum fluctuations. It is then interesting to ask whether a
small particle that is interacting with a quantum field will exhibit Brownian
motion when the quantum field is assumed to be in the vacuum state. In this
paper, we study the cases of a small charge and an imperfect mirror interacting
with a quantum scalar field in (1+1) dimensions. Treating the quantum field as
a classical stochastic variable, we write down a Langevin equation for the
particles. We show that the results we obtain from such an approach agree with
the results obtained from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Unlike the
finite temperature case, there exists no special frame of reference at zero
temperature and hence it is essential that the particles do not break Lorentz
invariance. We find that that the scalar charge breaks Lorentz invariance,
whereas the imperfect mirror does not. We conclude that small particles such as
the imperfect mirror {\it will} exhibit Brownian motion even in the quantum
vacuum, but this effect can be so small that it may prove to be difficult to
observe it experimentally.

discribed with a Lax pair with a spectral parameter on an elliptic curve. This
is used in this paper to perform a finite gap integration.
