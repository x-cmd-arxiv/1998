In the standard thermal scenario, an axion string network forms at the
Peccei-Quinn phase transition $T\sim \fa$ and then radiatively decays into a
cosmological background of axions; to be the dark matter, these axions must
have a mass $\ma \sim 100 \mu eV$ with specified large uncertainties. An
inflationary phase with a reheat temperature below the PQ-scale $T_{reh} \lapp
\fa$ can also produce axion strings through quantum fluctuations, provided that
the Hubble parameter during inflation is large $H_1 \gapp \fa$; this case again
implies a dark matter axion mass $\ma \sim 100 \mu eV$. For a smaller Hubble
parameter during inflation $H_1 \lapp \fa$, `anthropic tuning' allows dark
matter axions to have any mass in a huge range below $\ma\lapp 1 meV$.

new submillimetre camera (SCUBA at the JCMT). At 850 microns wavelength a ring
of dust is seen, peaking at 60 AU from the star and with much lower emission
inside 30 AU. The mass of the ring is at least 0.01 Earth masses in dust, while
an upper limit of 0.4 Earth masses in molecular gas is imposed by CO
observations. The total mass is comparable to the estimated amount of material,
0.04-0.3 Earth masses, in comets orbiting the Solar System.
  The most probable origin of the the ring structure is that it is a young
analogue to the Kuiper Belt in our Solar System, and that the central region
has been partially cleared by the formation of grains into planetesimals. Dust
clearing around epsilon Eri is seen within the radius of Neptune's orbit, and
the peak emission at 35-75 AU lies within the estimated Kuiper Belt zone of
30-100 AU radius. epsilon Eri is a main-sequence star of type K2V (0.8 Solar
masses) with an estimated age of 0.5-1.0 Gyr, so this interpretation is
consistent with the early history of the Solar System where heavy bombardment
occurred up to approximately 0.6 Gyr. An unexpected discovery is substructure
within the ring, and these asymmetries could be due to perturbations by
planets.

absorption line profiles demonstrate their origin in a jet, directed closely to
the line of sight. These absorptions are variable at a time-scale less than one
day and with an amplitude of about 10%. The fast variability of the absorption
line profiles at 3 hours have been observed. An evidence of the opposite
(second) jet has been found.
  An estimates of the orbital inclination angle about 10 deg and the jets
parameters have been derived. We have simulated the continuum spectrum from UV
to IR in the two different states (high and low) of MWC560. The observed
spectrum is formed in a M4-5III giant, a hot source and in an absorbing screen
(the jet). The object luminousity 2 10^37 erg/s is mainly from the UV source,
whose temperature and size are 20000 K and 4 10^11 cm. The hot source is
probably a photosphere of a massive wind (2 10^-6 M of Sun/year) rising from
inner area aroung the white dwarf.
  We suppose that both the wind and jets are accelerated in magnetic field of
the white dwarf, which accretes the gas from the giant wind as a propeller. The
gas flows in accretion disk and is expelled from that by the rotating magnetic
field. A sectorial structure of the outflow (jets) is formed. A surface
magnetic field strength on the white dwarf is 3 10^8 G < B < 3 10^9 G, its

(or Lense-Thirring) effect: the orbital plane of a test particle in a
non-equatorial orbit precesses about the body's symmetry axis. In this paper we
compute the precession frequencies of circular orbits around rapidly rotating
neutron stars for a variety of masses and equations of state. The precession
frequencies computed are expressed as numerical functions of the orbital
frequency observed at infinity. The post-Newtonian expansion of the exact
precession formula is examined to identify the relative magnitudes of the
precession caused by the Lense-Thirring effect, the usual Newtonian quadrupole
effect and relativistic corrections. The first post-Newtonian correction to the
Newtonian quadrupole precession is derived in the limit of slow rotation. We
show that the post-Newtonian precession formula is a good approximation to the
exact precession close to the neutron star in the slow rotation limit (up to
\sim 400 Hz in the present context).
  The results are applied to recent RXTE observations of neutron star low-mass
X-ray binaries, which display kHz quasi-periodic oscillations and, within the
framework of beat frequency models, allow the measurement of both the neutron
star spin frequency and the Keplerian frequency of the innermost ring of matter
in the accretion disk around it. For a wide range of realistic equations of
state, we find that the predicted precession frequency of this ring is close to
one half of the low-frequency (\sim 20 - 35 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations
seen in several Atoll sources.

explanations. First, the difference could be caused by vertical colour
gradients in spiral galaxies. In that case these gradients should be similar
for all galaxies, on average 0.15 dex in [Fe/H] per scale height, and increase
for later galaxy types. The most likely explanation, however, is that spirals
and ellipticals have intrinsically different CM relations. This means that the
stars in spirals are younger than those in ellipticals. The age, however, or
the fraction of young stars in spiral galaxies, would be determined solely by
the galaxy's luminosity, and not by its environment.

superconductor is developed under the assumption of disordered vortex array. A
novel universal regime is identified at fields above H*= c*H_{c2}(T/T_c)^2,
characterized by a field-independent longitudinal thermal conductivity. It is
argued that this behavior is responsible for the high-field plateau in the
thermal conductivity experimentally observed in cuprates by Krishana, Ong and

ranging from 0.04 Angstroms/gauss for Delta-Lambda_a to 0.10 Angstroms/gauss

  quantum computer","13 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A new approach to the implementation of a quantum computer by high-resolution
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is described. The key feature is that two or
more line-selective radio-frequency pulses are applied simultaneously. A
three-qubit quantum computer has been investigated using the 400 MHz NMR
spectrum of the three coupled protons in 2,3-dibromopropanoic acid. It has been
employed to implement the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for distinguishing between
constant and balanced functions. The extension to systems containing more
coupled spins is straightforward and does not require a more protracted
experiment.
