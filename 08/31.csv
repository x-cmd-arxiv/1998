proportional to the star formation rate in the universe. In this paper, we
study the nature of GRB hosts expected in this scenario. We improve upon
previous studies by incorporating a luminosity function for the GRBs, as
required by observations. This model provides a good match to the observed
number counts of GRBs as a function of peak-count rate. The model predicts that
the host galaxies have their redshift distribution peaked around z~1, and about
15 percent have z>2.5. This high-redshift fraction have the same properties as
the star-forming galaxies recently discovered by the Lyman-break technique. At
z<~1, many of the GRBs may be hosted by faint blue galaxies. Using a
photometric redshift sample of galaxies from the Hubble Deep Field, we find
that the host galaxies have magnitudes in the range from 21.5 to 28 in the
I-band, and about 90 percent of them have semi-major axis smaller than 1.3
arcsec. Assuming isotropic emission, the typical peak-luminosity and total
energy of GRBs are in an Einstein-de Sitter universe with H_0=100km/s/Mpc. We
also discuss further observational tests of this scenario.

195 objects with $K_s < 20$ mag, of which 84% have redshifts. The sample
includes 24 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic stars, 136 galaxies, three
AGNs, and 32 objects without redshifts.
  About 10% of the sample has $(R-K) \ge 5$ mag. Four of these objects have
redshifts, with $0.78 \le z \le 1.23$. Three of these are based on absorption
features in the mid-UV, while the lowest redshift object shows the standard
features near 4000\AA. Many of the objects still without redshifts have been
observed spectroscopically, and no emission lines were seen in their spectra.
We believe they are galaxies with $z \sim 1 - 1.5$ that are red due to their
age and stellar content and not to some large amount of internal reddening from
dust.
  Among the many other results from this survey of interest here is a
determination of the median extinction in the mid-UV for objects with strong
emission line spectra at $z \sim 1 - 1.3$. The result is extinction by a factor
of $\sim$2 at 2400\AA.

This depletion, however, must create several small outbursts between main
outbursts, contrary to observations. Lower white dwarf temperatures may cause
the outburts to be of the `inside-out' type removing the UV delay. We conclude
that white dwarf irradiation of dwarf nova discs is not very efficient for
example because the UV radiation from the hot white dwarf does not penetrate
deep enough in the disc atmosphere. The total ablation of the inner disc by
e.g. evaporation (possibly related to illumination) appears to be a very
promising possibility, accounting for both the EUV delay and the general

not exclude a yet not recognised class of solar models, in which an explosive
energy source is present in the solar core besides the standard pp and CNO

source: local thermonuclear runaways. I derive a model independent inequality,
which shows that the problem of the missing beryllium neutrinos lies in that
the SuperKamiokande contains a term arising from neutrinos from a runaway
source which can produce high-energy electrons and high-energy axions, and muon
and tau neutrinos. I point out, that the temperature dependence of the
individual neutrino fluxes is related to pure nuclear physics but the usual
luminosity constraint is model dependent and actually is a questionable
assumption. Allowing non-pp,CNO reaction chains a new approach arises to
interpret the neutrino detector data. The explicit temperature dependence leads
to $\Phi_{pp} \propto T^4$ instead of the usual $\Phi_{pp} \propto T^{-1/2}$
for the SSM luminosity constraint. I assume a Sun analogue to the SSM with a
different $T_c$. The separate neutrino detector equations lead to separate
detector-related temperatures with the neutrino detector data. The results show
a slightly lower than standard central temperature. I attempt to show that
helioseismology is not in a necessary conflict with the dynamic solar model
presented here. The results of the calculations may propose solutions to the
problems of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations without an ad hoc
introduction of sterile neutrinos and present predictions to Borexino and SNO

diffusing and convected in a non-potential static random flow (the ``randomly

d < 4 for directed polymers (each monomer sees a different flow) and for d < 6
for isotropic polymers (each monomer sees the same flow) and more generally for
d<d_c(D) in the case of a manifold. This leads to new large scale behavior,
which we analyze using field theoretical methods. We show that all divergences
can be absorbed in multilocal counter-terms which we compute to one loop order.
We obtain the non trivial roughness zeta, dynamical z and transport exponents
phi in a dimensional expansion. For directed polymers we find zeta about 0.63
(d=3), zeta about 0.8 (d=2) and for isotropic polymers zeta about 0.8 (d=3). In
all cases z>2 and the velocity versus applied force characteristics is
sublinear, i.e. at small forces v(f) f^phi with phi > 1. It indicates that this
new state is glassy, with dynamically generated barriers leading to trapping,
even by a divergenceless (transversal) flow. For random flows with long-range
(LR) correlations, we find continuously varying exponents with the ratio gL/gT
of potential to transversal disorder, and interesting crossover phenomena
between LR and SR behavior. For isotropic polymers new effects (e.g. a sign
change of zeta - zeta_0) result from the competition between localization and
stretching by the flow. In contrast to purely potential disorder, where the
dynamics gets frozen, here the dynamical exponent z is not much larger than 2,
making it easily accessible by simulations. The phenomenon of pinning by
transversal disorder is further demonstrated using a two monomer ``dumbbell''
toy model.

indicates that the C_5 axis of the molecule is tilted by an angle $\approx$18^o
from the monoclinic b axis in contrast with the molecular orientation proposed
by Verheijen {\it et al.} [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 166}, 287 (1992)] where the C_5
axis is parallel to the monoclinic b axis. In this calculation we have
incorporated the effective bond charge Coulomb potential together with the
Lennard-Jones potential between the molecule at the origin of the monoclinic
unit cell and its six nearest neighbours, three above and three below. The
minimum energy configuration for the molecular orientations turns out to be at
$\theta$=18^o, $\phi$=8^o, and $\psi$=5^o, where $\theta$, $\phi$, and $\psi$
define the molecular orientations.

the nucleon spin autocorrelation function numerically for a variety of
potential densities and distributions which are meant to bracket realistic
conditions in a supernova core. For all plausible configurations the width of
the spin-density structure function is found to be less than the temperature.
This is in contrast with a naive perturbative calculation based on the one-pion
exchange potential which overestimates the width and thus suggests a large
suppression of the neutrino opacities by nucleon spin fluctuations. Our results
suggest that it may be justified to neglect the collisional broadening of the
spin-density structure function for the purpose of estimating the neutrino
opacities in the deep inner core of a supernova. On the other hand, we find no
indication that processes such as axion or neutrino pair emission, which depend
on nucleon spin fluctuations, are substantially suppressed beyond the
multiple-scattering effect already discussed in the literature. Aside from
these practical conclusions, our model reveals a number of interesting and
unexpected insights. For example, the spin-relaxation rate saturates with
increasing potential strength only if bound states are not allowed to form by
including a repulsive core. There is no saturation with increasing density of
scattering potentials until localized eigenstates of energy begin to form.

fluctuations. The results are applied to axion cosmology, where the
oscillations of the classical axion field, with a Sine-Gordon self-interaction
potential, constitute the cold dark matter of the universe. When the axion
misalignment angle at the QCD epoch, $\theta_0$, is small, the parametric
resonance of the axion fluctuations is not significant. However, in regions of
larger $\theta_0$ where axion miniclusters would form, the resonance may be
important. As a result, axion miniclusters may disintegrate into finer, denser
clumps. We also apply the theory of Sine-Gordon parametric resonance to
reheating in the Natural Inflation scenario. The decay of the inflaton field
due to the self-interaction alone is ineffective, but a coupling to other

energy bounds obtained from this theory. When the ends of the pronged string
are on D3-branes, the configuration preserves 1/4 supersymmetry with BPS
conditions including the Nahm equation. Using solutions of the Nahm equation
explicitly, we treat string junction configuration ending on the D3-branes from
the viewpoint of the D-string. In particular, when two separated pronged
strings end on the same D3-branes, they interact with each other through the
D3-branes and the resultant trajectories of three-pronged strings are found to
be curved non-trivially.

possible to divide the channel into shorter segments that are purified
separately and then connected by the method of entanglement swapping. This
method can be much more efficient than schemes based on quantum error
correction, as it makes explicit use of two-way classical communication. An
important question is how the noise, introduced by imperfect local operations

accumulates in such a compound channel, and how it can be kept below a certain

efficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect

purification over arbitrary long channels and tolerates errors on the per-cent
