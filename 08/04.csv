determining their physical properties such as position along the Hubble

mechanisms, including merging, ram-pressure stripping, gas compression,
gravitational interaction and cluster tides. The relative importance of these
mechanisms is often not clear, as their strength depends on poorly known
parameters such as the density, extent and nature of the massive dark halos
that surround galaxies. A nearby example of a galaxy interaction where the
mechanism is controversial is that between our own Galaxy and two of its
neighbours -- the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Here we present the first
results of a new HI survey which provides a spectacular view of this
interaction. In addition to the previously known Magellanic Stream, which
trails 100 degrees behind the Clouds, the new data reveal a counter-stream
which lies in the opposite direction and leads the motion of the Clouds. This
result supports the gravitational model in which leading and trailing streams
are tidally torn from the body of the Magellanic Clouds.

represent the real behaviour of the parameter considered. All the parameters
are derived from a bi-dimensional fitting of the galaxy image. We find that
extinction, though small at near infrared wavelengths, is sufficient to produce
observable effects. In particular the observed increase of the average disk
scalelength and the reddening of the disk I-H colour at high inclinations are
clear signatures of the presence of dust. The total H-band disk luminosity
depends little on inclination; on the other hand significant corrections to the
face-on aspect are derived for the H-band central disk brightness and the disk
scalelength. The bulge parameters exhibit little or no dependence on
inclination. Simulations carried out with a simple model for an
internally-extincted galaxy show that these results imply a central H-band
optical depth between 0.3 and 0.5.

about 20 increase of accuracy in the forthcoming Brookhaven National Laboratory
measurement of $a_{\mu}$ implies $-47 \times 10^{-11} \leq \Delta a_{\mu}\leq
118 \times 10^{-11}$, ($95 % C.L.$). This interval is used to get constraints
on the ""new physics"". The value of the one-loop contributions $a^{B_i}_l$ of
different bosons predicted within extension of the standard model and coupled
to a charged lepton are discussed. The dependence of $a^{B_i}_l$ on the masses
of the bosons and leptons of the vacuum polarization loops are investigated.
The constraints on ""new physics"" by requiring that the new contributions
$a^{B_i}_{\mu}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment lie within the latter
interval $\Delta a_{\mu}$ are obtained.

the framework of simple Lie algebras. Here, we explore the possibility of
explaining the degeneracy of the genetic code using basic classical Lie
superalgebras, whose representation theory is sufficiently well understood, at
least as far as typical representations are concerned. In the present paper, we
give the complete list of all typical codon representations (typical 64
-dimensional irreducible representations), whereas in the second part, we shall
present the corresponding branching rules and discuss which of them reproduce
the multiplet structure of the genetic code.

sense that they factor as P*Q, where P has size less than delta and Q is forced
to be delta-strategically closed. In this paper, generalizing the Levy-Solovay
theorem, I show that after such forcing, every embedding j:V[G]-->M[j(G)] in
the extension which satisfies a mild closure condition is the lift of an
embedding j:V-->M in the ground model. In particular, every ultrapower
embedding in the extension lifts an embedding from the ground model and every
measure in the extension which concentrates on a set in the ground model
extends a measure in the ground model. It follows that gap forcing cannot
create new weakly compact cardinals, measurable cardinals, strong cardinals,
Woodin cardinals, strongly compact cardinals, supercompact cardinals, almost
huge cardinals, huge cardinals, and so on.

uniformly with supercompact cardinals, strongly compact cardinals, strong
cardinals, measurable cardinals, or what have you. And like the Laver
preparation, the lottery preparation makes these cardinals indestructible by
various kinds of further forcing. A supercompact cardinal kappa, for example,
becomes fully indestructible by kappa-directed closed forcing; a strong
cardinal kappa becomes indestructible by less-than-or-equal-kappa-strategically
closed forcing; and a strongly compact cardinal kappa becomes indestructible
by, among others, the forcing to add a Cohen subset to kappa, the forcing to
shoot a club C in kappa which avoids the measurable cardinals and the forcing
to add various long Prikry sequences. The lottery preparation works best when
performed after fast function forcing, which adds a new completely general kind
of Laver function for any large cardinal, thereby freeing the Laver function
concept from the supercompact cardinal context.

group, the automorphism group of THAT group, and so on, iterating
transfinitely. Each group maps canonically into the next using inner
automorphisms, and so at limit stages one can take a direct limit and continue
the iteration. The tower is said to terminate if a fixed point is reached, that
is, if a group is reached which is isomorphic to its automorphism group by the
natural map. This occurs if a complete group is reached, one which is
centerless and has only inner automorphisms. Wielandt [1939] proved the
classical result that the automorphism tower of any centerless finite group
terminates in finitely many steps. Rae and Roseblade [1970] proved that the
automorphism tower of any centerless Cernikov group terminates in finitely many
steps. Hulse [1970] proved that the the automorphism tower of any centerless
polycyclic group terminates in countably many steps. Simon Thomas [1985] proved
that the automorphism tower of any centerless group eventually terminates. In
this paper, I remove the centerless assumption, and prove that every group has
a terminating transfinite automorphism tower.
