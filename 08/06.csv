all the stars that have ever been formed were formed in objects like those
detected here. The combination of their large contribution to the background
radiation and their extreme bolometric luminosities make these objects
excellent candidates for being proto-ellipticals. Optical astronomers have
recently shown that the UV-luminosity density of the universe increases by a
factor of about 10 between z=0 and z=1 and then decreases again at higher
redshifts. Using the results of a parallel submillimetre survey of the local
universe, we show that both the submillimetre source density and background can
be explained if the submillimetre luminosity density evolves in a similar way
to the UV-luminosity density. Thus, if these sources are ellipticals in the
process of formation, they may be forming at relatively modest redshifts.

Ly$\beta$ into optical continuum around H$\alpha$, and the basic atomic physics
has been discussed in several works on symbiotic stars. We propose that the
same process may operate in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and calculate the
linear polarization of the broad emission lines Raman-scattered by a high
column neutral hydrogen compnent. The conversion efficiency of the Raman
scattering process is discussed and the expected scattered flux is computed
using the spectral energy distribution of an AGN given by a typical power law.
The high column H {\sc i} component in AGN is suggested by many observations
encompassing radio through UV and X-ray ranges. When the neutral hydrogen
component with a column density $\sim 10^{22} cm^{-2}$ is present around the
active nucleus, it is found that the scattered H$\alpha$ is characterized by a
very broad width $\sim 20,000 km/s$ and that the strength of the polarized flux
is comparable to that of the electron-scattered flux expected from a
conventional unified model of narrow line AGN. The width of the scattered flux
is mainly determined by the column density of the neutral scatterers where the
total scattering optical depth becomes of order unity. The asymmetry in the
Raman scattering cross section around Ly$\beta$ introduces red asymmetric
polarized profiles around H$\alpha$. The effects of the blended Ly$\beta$ and O
{\sc vi} 1034 doublet are also investigated. We briefly discuss the
spectropolarimetric observations performed on the Seyfert galaxy IRAS

existing theory of the transport properties of disordered conductors in the
so-called weak localization regime. In particular, we demonstrate explicitly
that recent attempts to justify theoretically that the dephasing rate
(extracted from the magnetoresistance) remains finite at zero temperature are
based on the profoundly incorrect calculation. This demonstration is based on a
straightforward evaluation of the effect of the electron-electron interaction
on the weak localization correction to the conductivity of disordered metals.
Using well-controlled perturbation theory with the inverse conductance $g$ as
the small parameter, we show that this effect consists of two contributions.
First contribution comes from the processes with energy transfer smaller than
the temperature. This contribution is responsible for setting the energy scale
for the magnetoresistance. The second contribution originates from the virtual
processes with energy transfer larger than the temperature. It is shown that
the latter processes have nothing to do with the dephasing, but rather manifest
the second order (in $1/g$) correction to the conductance. This correction is
calculated for the first time. The paper also contains a brief review of the
existing experiments on the dephasing of electrons in disordered conductors and
an extended qualitative discussion of the quantum corrections to the
conductivity and to the density of electronic states in the weak localization
regime.

by a fixed flux of monomers onto a substrate. Adatoms diffuse on the surface,
leading to irreversible aggregation of islands. We also account for the
effective diffusion of islands, which originates from hopping processes of
their constituent adatoms, on the kinetics. When the diffusivity of an island
of mass k scales as k^{-mu}, the (mean-field) Smoluchowski rate equations
predicts steady behavior for 0<=mu<1, with the concentration c_k of islands of
mass k varying as k^{-(3-mu)/2}. For mu>=1, a quasi-static approximation to the
rate equations predicts slow continuous evolution in which the island density
increases as ln t^{mu/2}. A more refined matched asymptotic expansion reveals
unusual multiple-scale mass dependence for the island size distribution. Our
theory also describes basic features of epitaxial growth in a more faithful
model of growing circular islands. For epitaxial growth in an initial
population of monomers and no external flux, a scaling approach predicts
power-law island growth and a mass distribution with a behavior distinct from
that of the non-zero flux system. Finally, we extend our results to one- and
two-dimensional substrates. The physically-relevant latter case exhibits only
logarithmic corrections compared to the mean-field predictions.

the quantum coherent regime, we find that rho(x,y) scales with the longitudinal
resistivity rho(x,x), and they both diverge exponentially with dephasing
length. In the Ohmic limit, (dephasing length shorter than Hall puddles' size),
rho(x,y) remains quantized and independent of rho(x,x). This suggests a new
experimental probe for dephasing processes.

This allows, in particular, to properly implement the cancellation of the

inversion symmetric spatially one dimensional systems, where the character of
the bifurcation changes from sub- to supercritical behaviour. Starting from a
general equation of motion the full amplitude equation is derived
systematically and formulas for the dependence of the coefficients on the
system parameters are obtained. We emphasise the importance of nonlinear
derivative terms in the amplitude equation for the behaviour in the vicinity of
the bifurcation point. Especially the numerical values of the corresponding
coefficients determine the region of coexistence between the stable trivial
solution and stable spatially periodic patterns. Our approach clearly shows
that similar considerations fail for the case of oscillatory instabilities.

  surface","8 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1016/S0168-9002(98)00453-7",,"physics.acc-ph physics.optics",,"  A novel scheme is presented for production of a thin ($<1$ mm) uniform vapor
layer over a large surface area ($>100$ cm$^2$) by pulsed laser ablation of a
solid surface. Instead of dispersing the laser energy uniformly over the
surface, a modified Fabry-Perot interferometer is employed to concentrate the
laser energy in very narrow closely-spaced concentric rings. This approach may
be optimized to minimum total laser energy for the desired vapor density.
Furthermore, since the vapor is produced from a small fraction of the total
surface area, the local ablation depth is large, which minimized the fraction
of surface contamination in the vapor.
  Key words: laser evaporation, thin gas layer formation.

The
model describing interaction of collection of two-level atoms with a
single-mode of self-consistent field and an external field is analyzed. It is
shown that in the semiclassical limit, in contrast to the regular behaviour,
the chaotic dynamics result in: (i) an increase in squeezing, (ii) unstable
squeezing and contraction of time intervals of squeezing on large enough times.
The possibility of the experimental observation of the described effects is
discussed.

  KP Hierarchies","LaTeX, 9 pgs., contribution to Festschrift for A.H. Zimerman",,,,"solv-int hep-th nlin.SI",,"  We consider a broad class of consistently reduced Manin-Radul supersymmetric
KP hierarchies (MR-SKP) which are supersymmetric analogs of the ordinary
bosonic constrained KP models. Compatibility of these reductions with the MR
fermionic isospectral flows is achieved via appropriate modification of the
latter preserving their (anti-)commutation algebra. Unlike the general
unconstrained MR-SKP case, Darboux-Backlund transformations do preserve the
fermionic isospectral flows of the reduced MR-SKP hierarchies. This allows for
a systematic derivation of explicit Berezinian solutions for the
super-tau-functions (super-solitons) for these models.
