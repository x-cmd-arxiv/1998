galaxies (ELGs) at 0.11<z<0.5 using Keck/LRIS optical spectroscopy. The targets
exhibit a range of metallicities from slightly metal-poor like the LMC to
super-solar. Oxygen abundances of the sample correlate strongly with rest-frame
blue luminosities. The metallicity-luminosity relation based on these 14
objects is indistinguishable from the one obeyed by local galaxies, although
there is marginal evidence (1.1sigma) that the sample is slightly more
metal-deficient than local galaxies of the same luminosity. The observed
galaxies exhibit smaller emission linewidths than local galaxies of similar
metallicity, but proper corrections for inclination angle and other systematic
effects are unknown. For 8 of the 14 objects we measure nitrogen-to-oxygen
ratios. Seven of 8 systems show evidence for secondary nitrogen production,
with log(N/O)> -1.4 like local spirals. These chemical properties are
inconsistent with unevolved objects undergoing a first burst of star formation.
The majority of the ELGs are presently ~4 magnitudes brighter and ~0.5 dex more
metal-rich than the bulk of the stars in well-known metal-poor dwarf
spheroidals such as NGC 205 and NGC 185, making an evolution between some ELGs
and metal-poor dwarf spheroidals improbable. However, the data are consistent
with the hypothesis that more luminous and metal-rich spheroidal galaxies like
NGC 3605 may become the evolutionary endpoints of some ELGs. [abridged]

but neither measures separately, is t_*=r_*/v_\perp, the time it takes a star
moving at transverse speed v_\perp to cross its own radius r_*. This parameter
cleanly separates white dwarfs, main sequence stars, and giants, and
simultaneously separates disk from spheroid stars. The infrared photometry then
yields photometric parallaxes for the individual stars, while the proper

physical and velocity distributions of the known Galactic components and to
identify new ones. The analysis of such a huge data set poses a major technical
challenge. I offer some initial ideas on how to meet this challenge.

difficult to distinguish between the two cases. Cosmic-ray secondary
antiprotons provide a way to resolve this issue.
  We have made a calculation of the cosmic-ray secondary antiproton spectrum in
our model, which computes self-consistently propagation of primary and
secondary nucleons, and electrons. Fragmentation and energy losses are computed
using realistic distributions for the interstellar gas and radiation fields,
and diffusive reacceleration is also incorporated. Our study shows that
accurate measurements of the antiproton flux, especially at high energies,

test the hard nucleon spectrum hypothesis. Present antiproton data above 3 GeV
indicate that it can already be excluded at the few sigma level.

the abundance of the alpha-elements and iron independently for those groups
with sufficient counts. We find that for the cool groups (i.e. kT <1.5 keV) the
ratio of alpha-elements to iron is ~1, about half that seen in clusters.
Spectral fits with the S, Si and Fe abundances allowed to vary separately
suggest the S/Fe ratio is similar to that seen in clusters while the Si/Fe
ratio in groups is half the value determined for richer systems. The mass of
metals per unit blue luminosity drops rapidly in groups as the temperature
drops. There are two possible explanations for this decrease. One is that the
star formation in groups is very different from that in rich clusters. The
other explanation is that groups lose much of their enriched material via winds
during the early evolution of ellipticals. If the latter is true, we find that
poor groups will have contributed significantly (roughly 1/3 of the metals) to
the enrichment of the intergalactic medium.

concerning both the GRB and supernovae. Although the spectra resemble those of

appeared to be unusually bright and red at maximum light. The apparent
expansion velocities inferred by the Doppler shift of (unidentified) absorption
features appeared to be high, making SN1998bw a possible candidate for a
""hypernova"" with explosion energies between 20 and 50E51 erg and ejecta masses
in excess of 6 - 15 M_o. Based on light curve calculations for aspherical
explosions and guided by the polarization observations of ""normal"" SNIc and
related events, we present an alternative picture that allows SN1998bw to have
an explosion energy and ejecta mass consistent with core collapse supernovae
(although at the 'bright' end). We show that the LC of SN1998bw can be
understood as result of an aspherical explosion along the rotational axis of a
basically spherical, non-degenerate C/O core of massive star with an explosion
energy of 2foe and a total ejecta mass of 2 M_o if it is seen from high
inclinations with respect to the plane of symmetry. In this model, the high
expansion velocities are a direct consequence of an aspherical explosion which,
in turn, produces oblate iso-density contours. It suggests that the fundamental
core-collapse explosion process itself is strongly asymmetric.

supersymmetric models in the light of LEP data, especially the lower bound on
the Higgs boson mass, studying in particular its power of discrimination
between different parameter regions and different theoretical assumptions. The
analysis is performed using the full one-loop effective potential. The whole
range of $\tan\beta$ is discussed, including large values. In the minimal
supergravity model with universal gaugino and scalar masses, a small
fine-tuning price is possible only for intermediate values of $\tan\beta$.
However, the fine-tuning price in this region is significantly higher if we
require $b-\tau$ Yukawa-coupling unification. On the other hand, price
reductions are obtained if some theoretical relation between MSSM parameters is
assumed, in particular between $\mu_0$, $M_{1/2}$ and $A_0$. Significant price
reductions are obtained for large $\tan\beta$ if non-universal soft Higgs mass
parameters are allowed. Nevertheless, in all these cases, the requirement of
small fine tuning remains an important constraint on the superpartner spectrum.
We also study input relations between MSSM parameters suggested in some
interpretations of string theory: the price may depend significantly on these
inputs, potentially providing guidance for building string models. However, in
the available models the fine-tuning price may not be reduced significantly.

hypersurfaces of degree d in P^N. The preimage X of C in Y is a connected

described here) the restriction O_phi(Y) to O_phi(X) is an isomorphism for d
large enough.
  This yields new examples of Riemann surfaces and domains of holomorphy in C^n
with corona. We consider the important special case when Y is the unit ball B
in C^n, and show that for d large enough, every bounded holomorphic function on
X extends to a unique function in the intersection of all the nontrivial
weighted Bergman spaces on B. Finally, assuming that the covering group is
arithmetic, we establish three dichotomies concerning the extension of bounded
holomorphic and harmonic functions from X to B.
