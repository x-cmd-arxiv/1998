studied in order to understand the cores of star clusters in central regions of
galaxies. Stellar trajectories undergo tiny perturbation, the origin of which
is twofold: (i) gravitational field of a thin gaseous disc surrounding the
galactic centre, and (ii) cumulative drag due to successive interactions of the
stars with material of the disc. Both effects are closely related because they
depend on the total mass of the disc, assumed to be a small fraction of the
central mass. It is shown that, in contrast to previous works, most of the
retrograde (with respect to the disc) orbits are captured by the central
object, presumably a massive black hole. Initially prograde orbits are also
affected, so that statistical properties of the central star cluster in
quasi-equilibrium may differ significantly from those deduced in previous
analyses.

using the general information function is presented. The algorithm is based on
a strings sort technique and requires $O(N \log_2 N)$ computations. A rough
estimate for the number of points needed for the fractal dimension calculation
is given. The algorithm was tested on analytic example as well as well-known
examples, such as, the Lorenz attractor, the Rossler attractor, the van der Pol
oscillator, and the Mackey-Glass equation, and compared, successfully, with
previous results published in the literature. The computation time for the
algorithm suggested in this paper is much less then the computation time
according to other methods.

for diffusion localization and dissipation, and Feynman-Vernon formalism. At
high temperatures the propagator possess a Markovian property and we can write
down an equivalent Master equation. Unlike the case of the
Zwanzig-Caldeira-Leggett model, genuine quantum mechanical effects manifest
themselves due to the disordered nature of the environment. Using Wigner
picture of the dynamics we distinguish between two different mechanisms for
destruction of coherence. The analysis of dephasing is extended to the low
temperature regime by using a semiclassical strategy. Various results are
derived for ballistic, chaotic, diffusive, both ergodic and non-ergodic motion.
We also analyze loss of coherence at the limit of zero temperature and clarify
the limitations of the semiclassical approach. The condition for having
coherent effect due to scattering by low-frequency fluctuations is also pointed
out. It is interesting that the dephasing rate can be either larger or smaller
than the dissipation rate, depending on the physical circumstances.

system coupled with Chern-Simons gauge field in the presence of background
charge. We first define our classical spin system as non- relativistic
non-linear sigma model in which the order parameter spin takes value in the
non-compact manifold ${\cal M}=SU(1,1)/U(1)$. Although the naive model does not
allow any finite energy self dual solitons, it is shown that the gauged system
admits static Bogomol'nyi solitons with finite energy whose rotationally
symmetric soliton solutions are analyzed in detail. We also discuss the large
spin limit in which the self-dual equation reduces to the well-known gauged
non- linear Schr\""odinger model or Abelian Higgs model, depending on the choice
of the background charge term. Then, we perform quantization of the model. We
find that the spin algebra satisfies anomalous commutation relations, and the
system is a field theoretic realization of the anyons.
