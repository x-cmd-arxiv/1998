smoothed particle hydrodynamics) was used to simulate clump-clump collisions
occurring within GMCs.
  The collisions formed shock-compressed layers, out of which condensed
approximately co-planar protostellar discs of 7-60 solar masses and 500-1000AU
radius. Binary and multiple systems were the usual final state. Lower mass
objects were also produced, but commonly underwent disruption or merger. Such
objects occasionally survived by being ejected via a three-body slingshot event
resulting from an encounter with a binary system.
  Varying the impact parameter, b, altered the processes by which the
protostellar systems formed. At low b a single central disc formed initially,
and was then spun-up by an accretion flow, causing it to produce secondaries
via rotational instabilities. At mid b the shocked layer w hich formed
initially broke up into fragments, and discs were then formed via fragment
merger. At large b single objects formed within the compressed leading edge of
each clump. These became unbound from each other as b was increased further.
  The effect of changing numerical factors was examined by : (i) colliding
clumps which had been re-oriented before the collision (thus altering the
initial particle noise), and (ii) by quadrupling the number of particles in
each clump (thus increasing the resolution of the simulation). Both changes
were found to affect the small-scale details of a collision, but leave the
large scale morphology largely unaltered.
  It was concluded that clump-clump collisions provide a natural mechanism by
which multiple protostellar systems may form.

observed in many dusty astronomical environments, in particular, the diffuse
interstellar medium of the Galaxy. The spectral nature and the photon
conversion efficiency of the ERE identify the underlying process as highly
efficient photoluminescence by an abundant component of interstellar dust. We
have compared the photoluminescence properties of a variety of carbon- and
silicon-based materials proposed as sources for the ERE with the
observationally established constraints. We found that silicon nanoparticles
provide the best match to the spectrum and the efficiency requirement of the
ERE. If present in interstellar space with an abundance sufficient to explain
the intensity of the ERE, silicon nanoparticles will also contribute to the
interstellar 9.7 micron Si-O stretch feature in absorption, to the near- and
mid-IR nonequilibrium thermal background radiation, and to the continuum
extinction in the near- and far-UV. About 36% of the interstellar silicon
depleted into the dust phase would be needed in the form of silicon
nanoparticles, amounting to less than 5% of the interstellar dust mass. We
propose that silicon nanoparticles form through the nucleation of SiO in
oxygen-rich stellar mass outflows and that they represent an important
small-grain component of the interstellar dust spectrum.

kilohertz have now been discovered in more than a dozen neutron stars in
low-mass X-ray binary systems using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. There is
strong evidence that the frequencies of the kilohertz oscillations are the
orbital frequencies of accreting gas in nearly circular orbits around these
stars. Some stars that produce kilohertz QPOs may have spin frequencies greater
than 400 Hertz. For spin rates this high, first-order analytic treatments of
the effects of the star's rotation on its structure and the spacetime are
inaccurate. Here we use the results of a large number of fully relativistic,
self-consistent numerical calculations of the stellar structure of rapidly
rotating neutron stars and the interior and exterior spacetime to investigate
the constraints on the properties of such stars that can be derived if stable
circular orbits of various frequencies are observed. We have computed the
equatorial radius of the star, the radius of the innermost stable circular
orbit, and the frequency of the highest-frequency stable circular orbit as
functions of the stellar spin rate, for spin rates up to the maximum possible
and for several illustrative equations of state. Our calculations show that the
upper bounds on the stiffness of neutron star matter implied by a given orbital
frequency are typically significantly stricter for stars with spin frequencies
more than 400 Hertz than for slowly rotating stars.

local models succeed in reproducing anomalous effective charges thanks to large
atomic polarizabilities but, in ABO3 compounds, ab initio calculations favor
the physical picture based upon transfer of charges. Various results concerning
barium and strontium titanates are presented. The origin of anomalous Born

superstring cosmology. Scalar potentials which arise out of gaugino condensates
in string models are generally exponential in nature. In a cosmological setting
this allows for the existence of quasi scaling solutions, in which the energy
density of the scalar field can, for a period, become a fixed fraction of the
background density, due to the friction of the background expansion. Eventually
the field can be trapped in the minimum of its potential as it leaves the
scaling regime. We investigate this possibility in various gaugino condensation
models and show that stable solutions for the dilaton are far more common than
one would have naively thought.

reformulated similar to the motion of an effective particle moving along the
geodesic lines in an 'effective external field' of a tensor type. An exact
solution is found to the Fisher equations for the special case of fitness
matrix associated to the effect of chromosomal imprinting of mammals.
Biological sense of the differential- geometric constructions is discussed. The
affine curvature is considered as a direct consequence of an allele coupling in
the system. This curving of the selection dynamics geometry is related to an
inhomogenity of the time flow in the course of the selection.

x-ray scattering data and to elucidate these interactions for biologically
relevant systems. For this purpose Monte Carlo simulations have been performed
to obtain pressure P and positional fluctuations sigma. A new method, called
Fourier Monte-Carlo (FMC), that is based on a Fourier representation of the
displacement field, is developed and its superiority over the standard method
is demonstrated. The FMC method is applied to simulating a single membrane
between two hard walls, which models a stack of lipid bilayer membranes with
non-harmonic interactions. Finite size scaling is demonstrated and used to
obtain accurate values for P and sigma in the limit of a large continuous
membrane. The results are compared with perturbation theory approximations, and
numerical differences are found in the non-harmonic case. Therefore, the FMC
method, rather than the approximations, should be used for establishing the
connection between model potentials and observable quantities, as well as for
pure modeling purposes.

distances of about a meter for the current levels of cavity losses, and may be
useful for distributed quantum computing.
