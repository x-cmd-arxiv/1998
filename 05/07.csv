theories in the cold dark matter family. A widely used hypothesis identifies
rich clusters with high peaks of a suitably smoothed version of the linear
density fluctuation field. Their peculiar velocities are then obtained by
extrapolating the similarly smoothed linear peculiar velocities at the
positions of these peaks. We test these ideas using large high resolution
N-body simulations carried out within the Virgo supercomputing consortium. We
find that at early times the barycentre of the material which ends up in a rich
cluster is generally very close to a high peak of the initial density field.
Furthermore the mean peculiar velocity of this material agrees well with the
linear value at the peak. The late-time growth of peculiar velocities is,
however, systematically underestimated by linear theory. At the time clusters
are identified we find their rms peculiar velocity to be about 40% larger than
predicted. Nonlinear effects are particularly important in superclusters. These
systematics must be borne in mind when using cluster peculiar velocities to
estimate the parameter combination $\sigma_8\Omega^{0.6}$.

  publication in A&A Review",,"10.1007/s001590050012",,"astro-ph",,"  Soft X-ray Transients (SXRTs) have long been suspected to contain old, weakly
magnetic neutron stars that have been spun up by accretion torques. After
reviewing their observational properties, we analyse the different regimes that
likely characterise the neutron stars in these systems across the very large
range of mass inflow rates, from the peak of the outbursts to the quiescent
emission. While it is clear that close to the outburst maxima accretion onto
the neutron star surface takes place, as the mass inflow rate decreases,
accretion might stop at the magnetospheric boundary because of the centrifugal
barrier provided by the neutron star. For low enough mass inflow rates (and
sufficiently short rotation periods), the radio pulsar mechanism might turn on
and sweep the inflowing matter away. The origin of the quiescent emission,
observed in a number of SXRTs at a level of ~10^(32)-10^(33) erg/s, plays a
crucial role in constraining the neutron star magnetic field and spin period.
Accretion onto the neutron star surface is an unlikely mechanism for the
quiescent emission of SXRTs, as it requires very low magnetic fields and/or
long spin periods. Thermal radiation from a cooling neutron star surface in
between the outbursts can be ruled out as the only cause of the quiescent
emission. We find that accretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere and shock
emission powered by an enshrouded radio pulsar provide far more plausible
models. In the latter case the range of allowed neutron star spin periods and
magnetic fields is consistent with the values recently inferred from the
properties of kHz QPO in LMXRBs. If quiescent SXRTs contain enshrouded radio
pulsars, they provide a missing link between X-ray binaries and millisecond
pulsars.

producing such a counterrotating disk. We report on experiments with a cold
primary similar to our Galaxy, as well as a hot, compact primary modeled after
NGC 4138. We have also conducted numerical experiments with varying amounts of
prograde gas in the primary disk, and an alternative infall model (a spherical
shell with retrograde angular momentum). The structure of the resulting
counterrotating disks is dramatically different with SPH. The disks we produce
are considerably thinner than the primary disks and those produced with sticky
particles. The time-scales for counterrotating disk formation are shorter with
SPH because the gas loses kinetic energy and angular momentum more rapidly.
Spiral structure is evident in most of the disks, but an exponential radial
profile is not a natural byproduct of these processes. The infalling gas shells
that we tested produce counterrotating bulges and rings rather than disks. The
presence of a considerable amount of preexisting prograde gas in the primary
causes, at least in the absence of star formation, a rapid inflow of gas to the
center and a subsequent hole in the counterrotating disk. In general, our SPH
experiments yield stronger evidence to suggest that the accretion of massive
counterrotating disks drives the evolution of the host galaxies towards earlier
(S0/Sa) Hubble types.

star clusters, yet their integrated spectral properties do not resemble young

clusters' Balmer absorption appears to be too strong to be consistent with any
of the standard Bruzual & Charlot evolutionary models at any metallicity. If
these models are adopted, an IMF which is skewed to high masses provides a
better fit to the data. A truncated IMF with a mass range of 2-3 Mo reproduces
the observed Balmer equivalent widths and colors at about 450 Myr. Formation in
a continuous cooling flow appears to be ruled out since the age of the clusters
is much larger than the cooling time, the spatial scale of the clusters is much
smaller than the cooling flow radius, and the deduced star formation rate in
the cooling flow favors a steep rather than a flat IMF. A merger would have to
produce clusters only in the central few kpc, presumably from gas in the
merging galaxies which was channeled rapidly to the center. Widespread shocks
in merging galaxies cannot have produced these clusters. If these objects are
confirmed to have a relatively flat, or truncated, IMF it is unclear whether or

Lamb type, where the stellar magnetic field interacts with the Keplerian
accretion disk, MSPs could be produced from LMXBs if their magnetic field B <

However, for {\dot M} < {\dot M}_c ~ 10^{16}g/s accretion is likely to occur
via a quasi-spherical flow with a sub-Keplerian rotation. The sub-Keplerian
rotation rate is smaller than the Keplerian rate by a factor ~2-10. As a
consequence, the spin-up of LMXBs produces pulsars with spin periods longer by
a factor ~2-10 than those with a Keplerian accretion disk. The observed MSPs
could be produced only for B < 10^7G even when {\dot M}\sim {\dot M}_c ~
10^{16}g/s. This suggests that the low luminosity LMXBs with {\dot M} < {\dot
M}_c would not be able to spin-up to the observed MSPs. This rules out any
undetected populations of persistent, low luminosity LMXBs and potentially a
significant fraction of the atoll sources as a possible source population of
the observed MSPs. If a large number of undetected, persistent, low luminosity
LMXBs do exist, they could produce MSPs near the pulsar death line with
intrinsic electromagnetic luminosity <~ 10^{30} erg/s. The observed MSPs could
possibly arise from a population of soft x-ray transients (SXTs) containing
neutron stars although this is not supported by current estimates of the
outburst rate or numbers of such systems. Accretion induced collapse of low
magnetic field white dwarfs remains a possible channel for MSP formation.

determine the higher order biasing parameters. From these it is possible to
predict higher order cumulant correlators as well. Comparing the predictions

of the assumptions in the theory, most notably perturbation theory of the

disadvantage of building new trails and the durability of existing trails.
Computer simulations of trail formation indicate to be a valuable tool for
designing systems of ways which satisfy the needs of pedestrians best. An

occurrence of long-ranged orientational order, and the structural properties of

consists of spherical particles interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential plus
dipolar forces. For sufficiently strong dipole moments one finds a region where
a fluid phase with long-ranged orientational order is stable. For all sample
shapes with the exception of a long thin needle this phase exhibits a spatially
inhomogeneous magnetization which depends on the actual shape. We determine the
details of the magnetization structure in a cubic sample in the absence and in
the presence of an external magnetic field. One obtains a vortexlike structure
with an escape of the magnetization into the axis direction near the vortex
axis and two point defects where the absolute value of the magnetization is
strongly reduced. If the spherical cores of the particles are replaced by
elongated or oblate shapes a nematic phase without spontaneous magnetization is
also possible due to the anisotropic steric interactions. We study the
interplay of this nematic ordering with ferromagnetism in fluids of dipolar
hard ellipsoids. Orientational order arises locally in the isotropic fluid
phases near the liquid-gas interface of the Stockmayer fluid.
Density-functional theory allows us to determine density and orientational
order profiles as well as the surface tension of this interface.

black holes. Both are generically defined locally by outer trapping horizons,
temporal for wormholes and spatial or null for black and white holes. Thus
wormhole horizons are two-way traversible, while black-hole and white-hole
horizons are only one-way traversible. It follows from the Einstein equation
that the null energy condition is violated everywhere on a generic wormhole
horizon. It is suggested that quantum inequalities constraining negative energy
break down at such horizons. Wormhole dynamics can be developed as for
black-hole dynamics, including a reversed second law and a first law involving
a definition of wormhole surface gravity. Since the causal nature of a horizon
can change, being spatial under positive energy and temporal under sufficient
negative energy, black holes and wormholes are interconvertible. In particular,
if a wormhole's negative-energy source fails, it may collapse into a black
hole. Conversely, irradiating a black-hole horizon with negative energy could
convert it into a wormhole horizon. This also suggests a possible final state
of black-hole evaporation: a stationary wormhole. The new framework allows a
fully dynamical description of the operation of a wormhole for practical
transport, including the back-reaction of the transported matter on the
wormhole. As an example of a matter model, a Klein-Gordon field with negative
gravitational coupling is a source for a static wormhole of Morris & Thorne.

Introducing a cut-off function or a non-local interaction, the Noether current
must be modified and thus the Ward-Takahashi identity and the PCAC relation are
modified accordingly. We point out that the pion decay constant must be defined
consistently with the Noether current so that the low-energy relations are
satisfied. We define the proxy of the Noether current for general effective
models, which is consistent with loop expansion of the
Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action. A general formula for the pion
decay constant in terms of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is derived.
  The effective Pagels-Stokar formula is proposed which is useful to estimate
the decay constant without solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation.

one equilibrium state to another. The entropy constructed here is defined only
for equilibrium states and no attempt is made to define it otherwise.
Statistical mechanics does not enter these considerations. One of the main
concepts that makes everything work is the comparison principle (which, in
essence, states that any two states of the same chemical composition can be
connected by an adiabatic process) and we show that it can be derived from some
assumptions about the pressure and thermal equilibrium. Temperature is derived
from entropy, but at the start not even the concept of `hotness' is assumed.

I define a state-sum for any triangulated compact closed oriented 4-manifold
and show that this state-sum does not depend on the chosen triangulation by
proving invariance under the 4D Pachner moves. This invariant of piece-wise
linear closed compact oriented 4-manifolds generalizes the Crane-Yetter
invariant and probably it is also a generalization of the Crane-Frenkel
invariant. As an example we show how to obtain a 2-category of the right kind
from a finite group and a 4-cocycle on this group. The invariant we obtain from
this example looks like a four dimensional version of the Dijkgraaf-Witten

An alternative to Kohn-Sham theory is to express the energy as a functional of

the former approach the unknown part of the functional contains both a kinetic
and a potential contribution whereas in the latter approach it contains only a
potential energy and consequently has simpler scaling properties. We present an
approximate, simple and parameter-free functional of the natural orbitals,
based solely on scaling arguments and the near satisfaction of a sum rule. Our
tests on atoms show that it yields on average more accurate energies and charge
densities than the Hartree Fock method, the local density approximation and the
