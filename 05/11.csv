as lack of resolution on spectral properties of the Lyman alpha forest as
computed from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in a standard cold dark
matter universe. We assume an ionising background produced by quasars as
computed by Haardt & Madau. We use a new simulation code based on P3M and SPH,
which we compare in detail with a modified version of HYDRA (Couchman et al.)
and published results of TREESPH (Hernquist et al.). The agreement is very good
between all three codes. We then use our new code to investigate several
numerical effects such as resolution on spectral statistics deduced from Voigt
profile fitting. Our highest resolution simulation has a mass resolution of
2.1x10^5 solar masses. The column density distribution is converged but the
b-parameter distribution is only marginally converged. The simulation
reproduces both the HI column density and b-parameter distribution when we
assume a high baryon density, Omega_B h^2 > 0.028. In addition we need to
impose a higher IGM temperature than predicted within our basic set of
assumptions. The simulated HI optical depth is in good agreement with
observations but the HeII optical depth is lower than observed. Fitting the
latter requires a larger jump between the photon flux at the H and He edge than
is present in the Haardt & Madau spectrum.

fraction of cooling flows in this sample to be 70-90 percent and estimate the
contribution of the flow region to the cluster X-ray luminosity. We show that
the luminosity within a strong cooling flow can account for up to 70 percent of
a cluster X-ray bolometric luminosity. Our analysis indicates that about 40
percent of the clusters in the sample have flows depositing more than 100
\Msunpyr throughout the cooling region and that these possibly have been
undisturbed for many Gyr, confirming that cooling flows are the natural state
of cluster cores. New cooling flows in the sample are presented and previously
ambiguous ones are clarified. We have constructed a catalogue of some
intracluster medium properties for the clusters in this sample. The profiles of
the mass deposited from cooling flows are analyzed and evidence presented for
the existence of breaks in some of the profiles. Comparison is made to recent
optical and radio data. We cross-correlate our sample with the Green Bank, NVSS
and FIRST surveys and to the volume-limited sample of brightest cluster
galaxies presented by Lauer and Postman (1994). Although weak trends exist, no
strong correlation between optical magnitude or radio power of the brightest
cluster galaxy and the strength of the flow is found.

and against a fractal behaviour with dimension $D \approx 2$. In this comment
we note firstly that, if such a cross-over exists as described by the authors,
the scale characterizing it is ~ 100 - 300 Mpc/h. This invalidates the
``standard'' analysis of the same catalogue given elsewhere by the authors
which results in a ``correlation length'' of only r_0 = 4 Mpc/h. Furthermore we
show that the evidences for a cross-over to homogeneity rely on the choice of
cosmological model, and most crucially on the so called K corrections. We show
that the D ~ 3 behaviour seen in the K-corrected data of Scaramella et al. is
in fact unstable, increasing systematically towards D=4 as a function of the
absolute magnitude limit. This behaviour can be quantitatively explained as the
effect of an unphysical K-correction in the relevant range of red-shift (z ~
0.1- 0.3). A more consistent interpretation of the number counts is that D is
in the range 2 - 2.5, depending on the cosmological model, consistent with the
continuation of the fractal D ~ 2 behaviour observed at scales up to ~100
Mpc/h. This implies a smaller K-correction. Given, however, the uncertainty in
the effect of intrinsic fluctuations on the number counts statistic, and its
sensitivity on these large scales to the uncertain K corrections, we conclude
that it is premature to put a definitive constraint on the galaxy distribution
using the ESP data alone.

distance to the bulge, the LMC and SMC, and to M31. It was assumed to be a
standard candle based on the observational fact that it is independent of
(V-I)-colour in all observed populations. The calibration was done using nearby
clump stars with HIPPARCOS-parallaxes. The most surprising result of this
procedure was the claim that the distance to the LMC was only 18.04 mag. In the
present paper we show that with a population synthesis approach we can
reproduce the constancy of M_I with colour for the local Hipparcos clump
sample. Nevertheless, M_I is not a constant among different populations, but
depends on metallicity. As a result, the determined distance modulus to the LMC
of 18.28+-0.18 mag is in better agreement with standard values. This resolves,
at least partially, the controversial result obtained by the assumption of a
universal value for M_I. We also find and discuss substructures in the clump:
we predict that stars slightly heavier than the maximum mass for developing
degenerate He cores should define a secondary, clumpy structure, about 0.3 mag
below the bluest extremity of the red clump. This secondary clump can be
clearly identified in the HIPPARCOS database of stars. We argue that there
remain severe uncertainties in the use of clump stars as a distance indicator.

curve was analysed by using the WD code to derive the geometrical and physical
parameters of the system. Since no spectroscopic mass ratio is available, the
q-search method was applied to yield the preliminary range of the mass ratio in
order to search for the final solution. First the unspotted solution was
carried out by using the unperturbed parts of the light curve and applying the
DC program of the WD code. The solution was performed by assuming contact (mode
3) and semi-detached (mode 4) configuration, since no classification of the
system is possible from the shape of the light curve. The solution in mode 4
does not lead to an acceptable model, since the secondary was found to be
slightly overcontact. Therefore the contact solution was finally adopted.
Moreover the light curve peculiarities (Max II fainter than Max I and excess of
light around the phase 0.32) were explained by assuming a cool and a hot spot
on the surface of the secondary (cooler) component. The degree of contact is
very small (f about 3%) and the thermal contactis poor (T1-T2) about 650 K.
These results together with the high photometric mass ratio q about 0.89
indicate that YY CMi is very probably a system at the beginning or the end of
the contact phase.

conclude that major merger events have taken place in at least two of the

their double nuclei and high infrared luminosities. Their Ha gas content is
strongly spatially concentred - H16d contains a peculiar bar-like structure
confined to the inner $\sim$ 1 h^-1 kpc region. These observations are in
agreement with predictions of simulations, namely that the gas flows towards
the galaxy nucleus during mergers, forms bars and fuel the central activity.
Galaxy H16b, and Sb galaxy, also presents some of the kinematic evidences for
past accretion events. Its gas content, however, is very spare, limiting our
ability to find other kinematic merging indicators, if they are present. We
find that isolated mergers, i.e., they show an anormorphous morphology and no
signs of tidal tails. Tidal arms and tails formed during the mergers may have
been stripped by the group potential (Barnes & Hernquist 1992) ar alternatively
they may have never been formed. Our observations suggest that HCG 16 may be a

observed values. The larger observed values of the tunnel magnetoresistance
(TMR) might be a result of tunneling involving surface polarized states. It is
found that tunneling via resonant defect states in the barrier radically
decreases the TMR by order of magnitude. One-magnon emission is shown to reduce
the TMR, whereas phonons increase the effect. The inclusion of both magnons and
phonons reasonably explains an unusual bias dependence of the TMR. The model
presented here is applied qualitatively to half-metallics with 100% spin
polarization, where one-magnon processes are suppressed and the change in
resistance in the absence of spin-mixing on impurities may be arbitrarily
large. Even in the case of imperfect magnetic configurations, the resistance
change can be a few 1000 percent. Examples of half-metallic systems are

which the small capacitance of the junctions plays an important role. In arrays
where the junctions have a relatively large charging energy, (i.e. when they
have a low capacitance) and a high normal state resistance, the low bias
resistance increases with decreasing temperature and eventually at very low
temperature the array becomes insulating even though the electrodes in the
array are superconducting. This transition to the insulating state can be
described by thermal activation. In an intermediate region where the junction
resistance is of the order of the quantum resistance and the charging energy is
of the order of the Josephson coupling energy, the arrays can be tuned between
a superconducting and an insulating state with a magnetic field. We describe

magnitude. Four arrays follow the same universal function. At the transition
the transverse (Hall) resistance is found to be very small in comparison with
the longitudinal resistance. However, for magnetic field values larger than the
critical value.we observe a substantial Hall resistance. The Hall resistance of
these arrays oscillates with the applied magnetic field. features in the
magnetic field dependence of the Hall resistance can qualitatively be
correlated to features in the derivative of the longitudinal resistance,
similar to what is found in the quantum Hall effect.

sonoluminescence in terms of photon production due to changes in the properties
of the quantum-electrodynamic (QED) vacuum arising from a collapsing dielectric
bubble. This mechanism can be re-phrased in terms of the Casimir effect and has
recently been the subject of considerable controversy. The present paper probes
Schwinger's suggestion in detail: Using the sudden approximation we calculate
Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum in the presence of the expanded
bubble to that in the presence of the collapsed bubble. In this way we derive
an estimate for the spectrum and total energy emitted. We verify that in the
sudden approximation there is an efficient production of photons, and further
that the main contribution to this dynamic Casimir effect comes from a volume
term, as per Schwinger's original calculation. However, we also demonstrate
that the timescales required to implement Schwinger's original suggestion are
not physically relevant to sonoluminescence. Although Schwinger was correct in
his assertion that changes in the zero-point energy lead to photon production,
nevertheless his original model is not appropriate for sonoluminescence. In
other works (see quant-ph/9805023, quant-ph/9904013, quant-ph/9904018,
