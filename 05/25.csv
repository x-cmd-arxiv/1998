the cut-out power-law disks. Although the cut-out disks are remarkably stable
to bisymmetric perturbations, they are very susceptible to one-armed modes. For
this harmonic, there is no inner Lindblad resonance, thus removing a powerful
stabilising influence. A physical mechanism for the generation of the one-armed
instabilities is put forward. Incoming trailing waves are reflected as leading
waves at the inner cut-out, thus completing the feedback for the
swing-amplifier. Growing three-armed and four-armed modes occur only at very
low temperatures. The rotation curve index has a marked effect on stability.
For all azimuthal wavenumbers, any unstable modes persist to higher
temperatures and grow more vigorously if the rotation curve is rising than if
the rotation curve is falling. If the central regions or outer parts of the
disk are carved out more abruptly, any instabilities become more virulent. The
self-consistent power-law disks possess a number of unusual stability
properties. There is no natural time-scale in the self-consistent disk. If a
mode is admitted at some pattern speed and growth rate, then it must be present
at all pattern speeds and growth rates. Our analysis suggests that such a
two-dimensional continuum of non-axisymmetric modes does not occur and that the
self-consistent power-law disks admit no global non-axisymmetric normal modes
whatsoever. Without reflecting boundaries or cut-outs, there is no resonant
cavity and no possibility of unstable growing modes. The self-consistent
power-law disks certainly admit equiangular spirals as neutral modes, together
with a one-dimensional continuum of growing axisymmetric modes.

Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have assumed homogeneous present day mass
functions (PDMFs) for the lensing populations. Here, we present an
investigation into the microlensing characteristics of haloes with spatially
varying PDMFs and anisotropic velocity dispersion tensors. One attractive
possibility -- suggested by baryonic dark cluster formation in pregalactic and
protogalactic cooling flows -- is that the inner halo is dominated by stellar
mass objects, whereas low mass brown dwarfs become more prevalent on moving
outwards. The contribution to the microlensing rate must be dominated by dark
remnants (of about 0.5 solar masses) to recover the observed timescales of the
microlensing experiments. But, even though stellar remnants control the rate,
they do not dominate the mass of the baryonic halo, and so the well-known
enrichment and mass budget problems are much less severe. Using a simple ansatz
for the spatial variation of the PDMF, models are constructed in which the
contribution of brown dwarfs to the mass of the baryonic halo is 55 % and to
the total halo is 30 %. An unusual property of the models is that they predict
that the average timescale of events towards M31 is shorter than the average
timescale towards the LMC. This is because the longer line of sight towards M31
probes more of the far halo where brown dwarfs are the most common constituent.

with a triaxial dark matter halo component. We also examine the effect of weak
discreteness noise, rapidly rotating bar perturbations and weak dissipation on
these trajectories. If the matter distribution is triaxial and has a constant
density core, dissipation leads to inflow of material inside the core radius to
the centre. This leads to the formation of central masses which in turn
destabilise the trajectories of any stars formed in these regions. In
particular, even if the gas settles by dissipation into a flat disk, stars
formed in that disk will later form a bulge like dstribution the extent of
which would be related to the core radius of the halo and the original
asymmetry in the plane. The process of gas inflow is regulated by the fact that
too large and condensed a central mass leads to the creation of stable closed
loop orbits in the central area around which the gas can move. This would
appear to stop the accumulation of central mass before it becomes large enough
for rapid loss of halo triaxiality. It was found that weak discreteness noise
can change the fraction of such trajectories significantly and can therefore
have important consequences for the modelling of galaxies. The addition of
rapidly rotating bar perturbations also increases the degree of instability
dramatically. So if bars can form in triaxial haloes they are likely to be
quickly destroyed leaving a bulge like structure behind (which may explain the
absence of bars in surveys of high redshift galaxies).

Marigo et al. (1998) made the first attempt to consistently include the related
over-luminosity effect (i.e. above the Mc-L relation) in synthetic TP-AGB
calculations. In this paper the reliability of the solution scheme is tested by
comparison with the results of complete evolutionary calculations for a 7 Msun
AGB star undergoing envelope burning (e.g. Bloecker & Schoenberner 1991).
Indeed, the method proves to be valid as it is able to reproduce with
remarkable accuracy several evolutionary features of the 7 Msun star. We
present extensive synthetic TP-AGB calculations for stars with initial masses
of 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0 Msun, and three choices of the initial metallicity,

burning on such stellar parameters (M, Z, and alpha). The comparison between
different cases gives hints on the interplay between envelope burning

includes only mutual capacitances; Model B includes mutual and self
capacitances, leading to exponential screening of the electrostatic fields;
Model C includes a dense matrix $C_{\vec{r},\vec{r}'}$ that is constructed
approximately from superposition of an exact analytic solution for the
capacitance between two disks of finite radius and thickness. In the latter
case the electrostatic fields decay algebraically. For comparison, we have also
evaluated the full capacitance matrix using the MIT fastcap algorithm, good for
small lattices, as well as a corresponding continuum effective-medium analytic
evaluation of a finite voltage disk inside a zero-potential plane. In all cases
the effective $C_{\vec{r},\vec{r}'}$ decays algebraically with distance, with
different powers. We have then calculated current voltage characteristics for
DC+AC currents for all models. We find that there are novel giant capacitive
fractional steps in the I-V's for Models B and C, strongly dependent on the

in units inversely proportional to the lattice sizes and depend on the

the oscillating disk velocity, the energy of the exiting particles displays
non-monotonic gaps of allowed energies, and the distribution of exiting
particle velocities shows significant fluctuations in the low energy regime. We
also considered the case when the initial velocity distribution is Gaussian,

with the same mean and variance. When the initial particle velocities are in
the irregular regime the exit velocity distribution is Gaussian but with a
smaller mean and variance. The latter result can be understood as an example of
stochastic cooling. In the intermediate regime the exit velocity distribution
differs significantly from Gaussian. A comparison of the results presented in

long-range electron-electron Coulomb repulsion. The polaron tunneling dynamics
is mapped onto an effective low-energy Hamiltonian which takes the form of a
fermion tight-binding model with occupancy dependent, predominant- ly 2nd and
3rd neighbor tunneling matrix elements, excluded double occupan- cy, and an
effective intersite charge interactions. Antiferromagnetic spin correlations in
the original many-electron Hamiltonian are reflected by an attractive
contribution to the 1st neighbor charge interaction and by Berry phase factors
which determine the signs of effective polaron tunneling ma- trix elements. In
the two-polaron case, these phase factors lead to polaron pair wave functions

be perfectly realized. However, when the impurity potential dominates over the

model"", an application of the model to the neutrino mass matrix is
investigated: For the charged lepton and down-quark sectors, the model explains
the smallness of their masses $m_f$ by the conventional seesaw mechanism
M_f\simeq m_L M_F^{-1}m_R (M_F is a mass matrix of hypothetical heavy fermions
F). On the other hand, the observed fact m_t\sim \Lambda_L=O(m_L) (electroweak
scale \Lambda_L=174 GeV) seems to reject the applying of the seesaw mechanism
to the up-quark sector. However, recently, it has been found that, by taking
det M_F=0 for the up-quark sector F=U, we can understand the question of why
only top quark has a mass of the order of \Lambda_L without the
sesaw-suppression factor O(m_R)/O(M_F). For neutrino sector, the mass matrix
M_\nu is given by M_\nu \simeq m_L M_F^{-1} m_L^T (F=N), so that the masses
m_\nu are suppressed by a factor O(m_L)/O(m_R) compared with the conventional
quark and charged lepton masses. The model can naturally lead to a large mixing
\sin^2 2\theta \simeq 1. Also another model is investigated within the
framework of the universal seesaw model: the model leads to three sets of the
almost degenerate two Majorana neutrinos which are large mixing states between
the left-handed neutrinos \nu_{Li} and SU(2)_L\timesSU(2)_R singlet neutrinos
N_{1i} (i=e,\mu,\tau), so that the model can give a simultaneous explanation of
the atmospheric and solar neutrino data.

Lagrangian can be reduced, in the chiral limit where the light quark masses are

Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with non-abelian unbroken gauge group $H$ are in
one-to-one correspondence with coherent states of a dual or magnetic group
$\tilde H$. In the spirit of the Goddard-Nuyts-Olive conjecture this
observation is interpreted as evidence for a hidden magnetic symmetry of
Yang-Mills theory. SU(3) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with unbroken gauge group U(2)
is studied in detail. The action of the magnetic group on semi-classical states
is given explicitly. Investigations of dyonic excitations show that electric
and magnetic symmetry are never manifest at the same time: Non-abelian magnetic
charge obstructs the realisation of electric symmetry and vice-versa. On the
basis of this fact the charge sectors in the theory are classified and their
fusion rules are discussed. Non-abelian electric-magnetic duality is formulated
as a map between charge sectors. Coherent states obey particularly simple
fusion rules, and in the set of coherent states S-duality can be formulated as
an SL(2,Z)-mapping between sectors which leaves the fusion rules invariant.

intensity increases with decreasing temperature, but it remains constant with
increasing pressure while its position and width stay roughly the same. These
features are opposite to those observed for the 'first sharp diffraction peak'
of network glasses. The origin of the phenomenon is analyzed with the help of
Monte Carlo simulations. We associate the prepeak to hydrogen-bond-induced
heterogeneities (or clusters) whose limited size results from exclusion effect
between benzene rings that prevents the extension of a hydrogen-bond network.
