that continuous low rate star formation is likely to occur, during the
quiescent phases between bursts, in dwarf galaxies. We thus have used a
spectrophotometric model to reproduce the observed abundances in IZw 18,
assuming only a low constant star formation rate. We conclude that such a
continuous low star formation rate cannot be neglected, especially when
considering the chemical evolution of very metal poor objects.

evolution in dipping in this source. We show that the non-dip and dip spectra
in several intensity bands are well fitted using the same physical model that
we have previously shown gives good explanations of several dipping sources,
consisting of point source blackbody emission from the neutron star, plus
extended Comptonised emission from the accretion disk corona (ADC), with
progressive covering of the ADC during dipping. Best fit values of kT_bb = 1.99
+/- 0.16 keV and power law photon index Gamma = 1.70 +/- 0.16 are found. The
strong excess below 1 keV was well fitted by a Gaussian line at ~0.65 keV. In
dipping, good fits were obtained by allowing it to be covered by the same
progressive covering factor as the extended continuum emission, providing
strong evidence that the line originates in the ADC. By using our two-component
model we show that the unabsorbed component is the uncovered fraction of the
Comptonised emission, and in the band 1 - 10 keV, we do not need to invoke
substantial electron scattering to explain dipping.

  Coronae","50 pages, 13 figures, accepted by ApJ, 1999",,"10.1086/307703",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine the possibility that the relativistic jets observed in many active
galactic nuclei may be powered by the Fermi acceleration of protons in a
tenuous corona above a two-temperature accretion disk. In this picture the
acceleration arises as a consequence of the shearing motion of the magnetic
field in the corona, which is anchored in the underlying Keplerian disk. The
protons in the corona have a power-law distribution because the density there
is too low for proton-proton collisions to thermalize the energy supplied via
Fermi acceleration. The same shear acceleration mechanism also operates in the
disk itself, however, there the density is high enough for thermalization to
occur and consequently the disk protons have a Maxwellian distribution.
Particle acceleration in the corona leads to the development of a
pressure-driven wind that passes through a critical point and subsequently
transforms into a relativistic jet at large distances from the black hole. We
combine the critical conditions for the wind with the structure equations for
the disk and the corona to obtain a coupled disk/corona/wind model. Using the
coupled model we compute the asymptotic Lorentz factor $\Gamma_\infty$ of the
jet as a function of the cylindrical starting radius at the base of the
outflow, in the corona. Our results suggest that $\Gamma_\infty \lapprox 10$,
which is consistent with observations of superluminal motion in blazars. We
show that collisions between the jet and broad-line emission clouds can produce
high-energy radiation with a luminosity sufficient to power the $\gamma$-rays
observed from blazars.

supersoft X-ray source is one of only two accreting white dwarfs in the Galaxy
thought to be burning hydrogen on their surface as a consequence of a high rate
of mass transfer from a binary companion. Accurate orbital ephemerides are
derived from radial velocity measure- ments of HeII emission lines, which
exhibit a stable velocity semi- amplitude of 71.2 +- 3.6 km/s. We report the
discovery of transient, low-velocity, bipolar jets. These jets are respresented
by redshifted and blueshifted pairs of emission lines with an outflow velocity
of v cos(i) = 815 km/s, where i is the binary inclination angle. When present,
the jet lines also exhibit an orbital modulation of 71 km/s, which indicates
that the jets are oriented nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane. On most
occasions, the Hline profiles are further altered by P Cygni absorption. We
show that the jets and the P Cygni features have very different temporal
characteristics and binary phase dependence. The jet material and the absorbing
wind must therefore occupy very different geometries. Finally, the measured
mass function is combined with binary evolution models to suggest a limit, i <
40 deg. A particular model invoked to explain a high rate of mass transfer
requires 16 < i < 25. However, at such small inclination it is difficult to
explain the large amplitude of the orbital light curve. By contrast, a simple
model fit to the jet outflow lines indicates an orbital inclination angle of 35
< i < 60.

although a moderate number (~18) have by now been associated with X-ray

  We discuss the errors introduced by probable inaccurracies of the

magneto-optical effect, ignorance of the true atmosphere model to compute local
Stokes profiles, non-uniform surface brightness.
  The magnetic field configuration is found in the form of arbitrarily shifted
dipole and sum of dipole and quadrupole, along with the distribution of Si, Ti,
Cr and Fe over the surface of the star.
  Lines of different elements lead to the same magnetic field configuration,
which is reliably determined for the part of the stellar surface which faces
the observer. This allows to compare the magnetic field and chemical maps of
the surface of HD 215441. A large-scale ring structure with the magnetic pole
at its center is clearly seen on the abundance maps. Si, Cr and Ti are highly
deficient where the magnetic field lines are vertical (near the magnetic pole)
while Fe is highly overabundant there.

Euler and other fictitious forces arise in the frame which is at rest with

there is a time delay in the propagation of the magnetic field inside a

by devising a null experiment in which the Larmor precession of a charged

for the delay. In the ``combined'' problem of a collapsing charged shell we
show that, due to the coupling of electromagnetic and gravitational

in uniaxially anisotropic magnetic molecules such as Mn_12Ac (S=10) is
developed.The observed slow dynamics of the system is described by master
equations for the populations of spin levels.The latter are obtained by the
adiabatic elimination of fast degrees of freedom from the density matrix
equation with the help of the perturbation theory developed earlier for the
tunneling level splitting [D. A. Garanin, J. Phys. A, 24, L61 (1991)]. There
exists a temperature range (thermally activated tunneling) where the escape
rate follows the Arrhenius law, but has a nonmonotonic dependence on the bias
field due to tunneling at the top of the barrier. At lower temperatures this
regime crosses over to the non-Arrhenius law (thermally assisted tunneling).
The transition between the two regimes can be first or second order, depending
on the transverse field, which can be tested in experiments. In both regimes
the resonant maxima of the rate occur when spin levels in the two potential
wells match at certain field values. In the thermally activated regime at low
dissipation each resonance has a multitower self-similar structure with
progressively narrowing peaks mounting on top of each other.

the conductance changes to the usual Coulomb oscillations type. In the

decreasing when it is suppressed at T=0 by the interference cancellation
between different channels. The interaction effects in the quantum dot systems

algebras are constructed, namely those of the pseudoeuclidean Lie algebra
e(p,q). Use is made of the semidirect sum structure of e(p,q) with the
translations T(p+q) as an abelian ideal. We first construct splitting MASAs
that are themselves direct sums of abelian subalgebras of o(p,q) and of
subalgebras of T(p+q). The splitting subalgebras are used to construct the
complementary nonsplitting ones. We present general decomposition theorems and
construct indecomposable MASAs for all algebras e(p,q), p \geq q \geq 0. The
case of q=0 and 1 were treated earlier in a physical context. The case q=2 is
analyzed here in detail as an illustration of the general results.

  The leading and next-to-leading terms in the chiral expansion are taken into

the threshold branching ratios and the energy dependence of total cross

Whereas the proton and pion rapidity distributions as well as pion transverse

AGeV, the $K^+$ and $K^-$ spectra are noticeably underestimated at AGS energies
while the $K^+$ spectra match well at SIS and SPS energies with the
experimental data. We conclude that the failure of the hadronic model at AGS
energies points towards a nonhadronic phase during the collision of heavy
systems around 10 AGeV.

independent experiments and observations very recently. In this preliminary
