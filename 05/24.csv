supernovae is obtaining an accurate description of the transport of neutrinos
through the collapsed stellar core. The behavior of the neutrino distribution
function transitions from an LTE distribution in the center of the core to a
non-LTE distribution in the outer regions of the core. One method that has been
recently employed in order to model the flow of neutrinos in 2-D models is the
gray approximation. This approximation assumes that the neutrino distribution
can be described by a function that is parameterized in terms of a neutrino
temperature and a neutrino chemical potential. However, these parameters must
be assumed. Furthermore, the parameters will also differ between the LTE and
NLTE regions. Additionally, within the gray approximation the location at which
the neutrino distribution function transitions from LTE to NLTE must be
assumed. By considering a series of models where the LTE/NLTE decoupling point
is varied we show that the outcome of the numerical models is critically
sensitive to the choice of the decoupling point when the gray approximation is
employed. We also examine the effects of the neutrino--electron scattering
(NES) rate which is difficult to correctly formulate within the gray
approximation. We show that NES has a dramatic affect on the the overall
neutrino heating rate and the dynamics of the model. This result conflicts with
the results of high resolution multi-group models which model neutrino
transport without employing the gray approximation.

Gates (Chicago)","Brown Dwarfs, White Knights and Demons","15 pages, 3 figures, in press at The Astrophysical Journal (Letters)",,"10.1086/311478",,"astro-ph",,"  This paper investigates the hypothesis that the lensing objects towards the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are brown dwarfs by analysing the effects of
velocity anisotropy on the inferred microlensing masses. To reduce the masses,
the transverse velocity of the lenses with respect to the microlensing tube
must be minimised. In the outer halo, radial anisotropy is best for doing this;
closer to the solar circle, azimuthal anisotropy is best. By using a constraint
on the total kinetic energy of the tracer population from the Jeans equations,
the microlensing mass is minimised over orientations of the velocity dispersion
tensor. This minimum mass is about a tenth of a solar mass, which lies above
the hydrogen burning limit. This demonstrates explicitly that populations of
brown dwarfs with smoothly decreasing densities and dynamically mixed velocity
distributions cannot be responsible for the microlensing events. Brown dwarfs
are no white knights! There is one caveat. If there are demons sitting on the
microlensing tube, they can drop brown dwarfs so as to reproduce the
microlensing data-set exactly. Such a distribution is not smooth and does not
give well-mixed velocities in phase space. It is a permissible solution only if
the outer halo is dynamically young and lumpy. In such a case, theorists cannot
rule out brown dwarfs. Only exorcists can!

stellar disks of infinite extent. The rotation curve can be rising, falling or
flat. The self-consistent power-law disks are scale-free, so that all physical
quantities vary as a power of radius. They possess simple equilibrium
distribution functions depending on the two classical integrals, energy and
angular momentum. While maintaining the scale-free equilibrium force law, the
power-law disks can be transformed into cut-out disks by preventing stars close
to the origin (and sometimes also at large radii) from participating in any
disturbance. This paper derives the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation for
the in-plane normal modes in the self-consistent and the cut-out power-law
disks. This is done by linearising the collisionless Boltzmann equation to find
the response density corresponding to any imposed density and potential. The
normal modes -- that is, the self-consistent modes of oscillation -- are found
by requiring the imposed density to equal the response density. In practice,
this scheme is implemented in Fourier space, by decomposing both imposed and
response densities in logarithmic spirals. The Fredholm integral equation then
relates the transform of the imposed density to the transform of the response
density. Numerical strategies to solve the integral equation and to isolate the
growth rates and the pattern speeds of the normal modes are discussed.
