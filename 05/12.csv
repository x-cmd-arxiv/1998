the evolution of galaxies and their clustering over the redshift range 0 to
0.7. The sample is spread over four sky patches with a total area of about 1.5
square degrees. Here we report preliminary results based on two of the sky
patches, and the redshift range of 0.15 to 0.55. We find that galaxy evolution
can be statistically described as nearly pure luminosity evolution of early and
intermediate SED types, and nearly pure density evolution of the late SED
types. The correlation of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies is similar on
large scales but drops by a factor of three on scales less than about 0.3/h
mpc, approximately the mean scale of virialization. There is a clear, but
small, 60%, change in clustering with 1.4 mag of luminosity. To minimize these
population effects in our measurement of clustering evolution, we choose
galaxies with M_r^{k,e}<= -20 mag as a population whose members are most likely
to be conserved with redshift. Remarkably, the evolution of the clustered
density in proper co-ordinates at r < 10/h Mpc, proportional to r_0^gamma
(1+z)^3, is best described as a ``de-clustering'', (1+z)^{0.6+/-0.4}. Or
equivalently, there is a weak growth of clustering in co-moving co-ordinates,
x_0~ (1+z)^{-0.3 +/- 0.2}. This conclusion is supported by the pairwise
peculiar velocities which rise slightly, but not significantly, into the past.
The Cosmic Virial Theorem applied to the CNOC2 data gives Q Omega_M/b=0.11 +/-
0.04$, where Q is the three point correlation parameter and b the bias.
Similarly, galaxy groups have a virial mass-to-light ratio (evolution
corrected) of M_{virial}/L_R^{k,e} = 215h Lsun/Msun, or Omega_M=0.15 +/- 0.05.

Test particles gain energy from the electric field parallel to the open
magnetic field lines and lose energy by both curvature radiation (CR) and
resonant and non-resonant inverse Compton scattering (ICS) with soft thermal
X-rays from the neutron star (NS) surface. Gamma-rays radiated by electrons
accelerated from the stellar surface produce pairs in the strong magnetic
field, which screen the electric field beyond a pair formation front (PFF).
Some of the created positrons can be accelerated back toward the surface and
produce gamma-rays and pairs that create another PFF above the surface. We find
that ICS photons control PFF formation near the surface, but due to the
different angles at which the electron and positron scatter the soft photons,
positron initiated cascades develop above the surface and screen the
accelerating electric field. Stable acceleration from the NS surface is
therefore not possible in the presence of dominant ICS energy losses. However,
we find that stable acceleration zones may occur at some distance above the
surface, where CR dominates the electron and positron energy losses, and there
is up-down symmetry between the electron and positron PFFs. We examine the
dependence of CR-controlled acceleration zone voltage, width and height above
the surface on parameters of the pulsar and its soft X-ray emission. For most
pulsars, we find that acceleration will start at a height of 0.5 - 1 stellar
radii above the NS surface.

encounters involving binary stars. We model the formation and evolution of such

colour-magnitude diagram. We use a crude representation of cluster dynamics and
detailed binary-single star encounter simulations to produce cross sections and
rates for a variety of collisions. The results of the collisions are determined
based on SPH simulations of realistic star models. The evolution of the
collision products are then followed in detail.
  We use our results to explore the effects of a variety of input assumptions
on the number and kind of blue stragglers created by collisions. In particular,
we describe the changes in the blue straggler distribution that result from
using realistic collision products rather than the ``fully-mixed'' assumption,
and from changes in assumptions about the number and orbital period
distribution of the primordial binary population. We then apply our models to
existing data from the core of M3, where the large blue straggler population is
thought to be dominated by collision products. We find that we have difficulty
successfully modeling the observed blue stragglers under a single consistent
set of assumptions. However, if 3 particularly bright blue stragglers are
considered to be part of a different observed population, the remainder can be
successfully modeled using realistic encounter products and assuming a 20%
binary fraction with plausible period distribution.

the distribution of their number as a function of Gamma-ray flux implies that
they occur once per (0.3-40) million years per bright galaxy and that they
deposit >10^{53} ergs into their surrounding interstellar medium. The blast
wave generated by a GRB explosion would be washed out by interstellar
turbulence only after tens of millions of years when it finally slows down to a
velocity of 10 km/s. This rather long lifetime implies that there could be up
to several tens of active GRB remnants in each galaxy at any given time. For
many years, radio observations have revealed the enigmatic presence of
expanding neutral-hydrogen (HI) supershells of kpc radius in the Milky Way and
in other nearby galaxies. The properties of some supershells cannot be easily
explained in terms of conventional sources such as stellar winds or supernova
explosions. However, the inferred energy and frequency of the explosions
required to produce most of the observed supershells agree with the above GRB

stars shows evidence for enrichment by solely massive stars. Recent
observations have identified more varied behavior in the pattern of elemental
abundances measured for metal-rich, [Fe/H]=-1, halo stars, with both high and
low values of the ratio of [alpha/Fe]. The low values are most naturally due to
the incorporation of iron from Type Ia supernovae. These `low-alpha' halo stars
have been interpreted as being accreted from dwarf galaxies. However, these
stars are on very high-energy radial orbits, that plunge into the Galactic
center, from the outer regions of the stellar halo. We demonstrate here that
known dwarf galaxies could not reproduce the observations. Rather, the
observations are consistent with fragmentation of a gaseous proto-halo into
transient star-forming regions, some of which are sufficiently dense to survive
close to the Galactic center, and self-enrich to relatively high metallicities.
Those that probe the outer halo sustain star formation long enough to
incorporate the ejecta from Type Ia supernovae. The values of the `Type II
plateau' in the element ratios for disk stars and for halo stars are equal.
This implies that the (massive) stars that enriched the early disk and halo had
the same IMF. However, there is a discontinuity in the chemical enrichment
history between the halo and disk, as probed by these samples, consistent with
previous inferences based on angular momentum considerations.

find that direct heating of disk stars by the satellite is not important
because the satellite's gravitational perturbation has little power at
frequencies resonant with the vertical stellar orbits. The satellite does
little damage to the disk until its decaying orbit resonantly excites
large-scale disk bending waves. Bending waves can damp through dynamical
friction from the halo or internal wave-particle resonances; we find that
wave-particle resonances dominate the damping. The principal vertical heating
mechanism is therefore dissipation of bending waves at resonances with stellar
orbits in the disk. Energy can thus be deposited some distance from the point
of impact of the satellite. The net heating from a tightly bound satellite can
be substantial, but satellites that are tidally disrupted before they are able

fluctuations is facilitated during the cosmic QCD transition due to a
significant decrease in pressure forces. For generic initial density
perturbation spectra this implies that essentially all PBHs may form with
masses close to the QCD-horizon scale, $M_h^{QCD}\sim 1M_{\odot}$. It is

times ($\tau_{1}$ for type 1 and $\tau_{2}$ for type 2) . We assume that at
intervals of time $\tau_{r}$, the site distribution changes. The effect of this
rearrangement on the diffusion coefficient is studied with varying $\tau_{r}$.
We study this effect for different ratios of dwell times of the two types of
sites (R) and also for different fractions (X) of the less conducting sites. An
empirical relation for D($\tau_{1}$ ,$\tau_{2}$,$\tau_{r}$,X) is suggested. We
have employed the well model and considered diffusion controlled by sites,
rather than bonds. So our approach is different from the dynamic bond
percolation model, which studies these aspects. Our results show that the
diffusion coefficient D may change by a factor of upto 3 (approximately) for
rapid rearrangement, and there is a considerable effect of varying X and R on
the range of variation of D, where X is the fraction of low conducting sites,
and R is the ratio of the dwell times for the two types of sites. Further for
$\tau_{r}$ > 250$\tau$ ($\tau$ is the time unit for the random walk) the effect

the energy density for a quantized field is negative. These negative energy
densities lead to many problems. Although quantum field theory introduces
negative energies, it also provides constraints in the form of quantum
inequalities (QI's). These uncertainty principle-type relations limit the
magnitude and duration of any negative energy. We derive a general form of the
QI on the energy density for both the quantized scalar and electromagnetic
fields in static curved spacetimes. In the case of the scalar field, the QI can
be written as the Euclidean wave operator acting on the Euclidean Green's
function. Additionally, a small distance expansion on the Green's function is
used to derive the QI in the short sampling time limit. It is found that the QI
in this limit reduces to the flat space form with subdominant correction terms
which depend on the spacetime geometry.
  Several example spacetimes are studied in which exact forms of the QI's can
be found. These include the three- and four-dimensional static Robertson-Walker
spacetimes, flat space with perfectly reflecting mirrors, Rindler and static de
Sitter space, and the spacetime outside a black hole. Finally, the application

strict constraints on the thickness of the negative energy region needed to

entropy of a pure state with respect to a division of a Hilbert space into two

The transmission medium is quantum entanglement between 1 and 2. In order to
support the interpretation, suggestive arguments are given: variational
principles in entanglement thermodynamics and quantum teleportation. It is
shown that a quantum state having maximal entanglement entropy plays an
important role in quantum teleportation. Hence, the entanglement entropy is, in

implications for the information loss problem and Hawking radiation are

locally (curvature may be present; big bangs are possible). However, the
systems differ from general relativity in that spacetime is a combinatorial
object, constructed by piecing together copies of finitely many types of
allowed neighborhoods in a prescribed manner. Hence at least initially there is
no metric. The role of diffeomorphism is played by a combinatorial equivalence
map which is local and preserves information content. Most of my results come
in the 1+1-dimensional oriented case. There sets of spaces may be described
equivalently by matrices of nonnegative integers, directed graphs, or symmetric
tensors; local equivalences between space sets are generated by simple matrix
transformations. These equivalence maps turn out to be closely related to the
flow equivalence maps between subshifts of finite type studied in symbolic
dynamics. Also, the symmetric tensor algebra generated by equivalence
transformations turns out to be isomorphic to the abstract tensor algebra
generated by commutative cocommutative bialgebras. In higher dimensions I study
the case where space is a special type of colored graph (discovered by Pezzana)
which may be interpreted as an n-dimensional pseudomanifold. Finally, I show
how one may study the behavior of combinatorial spacetimes by searching for
constants of motion, which typically are associated with local flows and often
may be interpreted in terms of particles.

string theory, we translate this question into the corresponding one about the
existence of the light-like limit of IIA superstring theory for any string
coupling $g_s$. We argue that perturbative string loop amplitudes should have a
finite and well-defined light-like limit provided the external momenta are
chosen to correspond to a well-defined DLCQ set-up. On the non-perturbative
side we consider states and amplitudes. We show that an appropriate class of
non-perturbative states (wrapped D-branes) precisely have the right light-like
limit. We give some indications that non-perturbative corrections to string
amplitudes, too, may behave as required in the light-like limit. Having
perturbative and non-perturbative evidence, this suggests that type IIA
superstring theory as a whole has a well-defined light-like limit (for any
string coupling $g_s$) and hence that the same is true for M-theory.

such a way that its right-hand side becomes simply a Schur Function. For this,
we need the use of fundamental weights.
  In the generic definition, an Elementary Schur Function $S_Q(x_1,x_2,..,x_Q)$
of degree Q is known to be defined by some polynomial of Q indeterminates $
x_1,x_2,..,x_Q $. It is also known that definition of Elementary Schur
Functions can be generalized in such a way that for any partition $(Q_k)$ of
weight Q and length k one has a Generalized Schur Function
$S_{(Q_k)}(x_1,x_2,..,x_Q)$. When they are considered for $A_{N-1}$ Lie
algebras, a kind of degeneration occurs for these generic definitions. This is
mainly due to the fact that, for an $A_{N-1}$ Lie algebra, only a finite number
of indeterminates, namely (N-1), can be independent. This leads us to define
{\bf Degenerated Schur Functions} by taking, for $Q > N-1$, all the
indeterminates $x_Q$ to be non-linearly dependent on first (N-1) indeterminates
$x_1,x_2,..,x_{N-1}$. With this in mind, we show that for each and every
dominant weight of $A_{N-1}$ we always have a (Degenerated) Schur Function
which provides the right-hand side of Weyl character formula.
  Generalized Schur Functions are known to be expressed by determinants of some
matrices of Elementary Schur Functions. We would like to call these expressions
{\bf multiplicity rules}. This is mainly due to the fact that, to calculate
weight multiplicities, these rules give us an efficient method which works
equally well no matter how big is the rank of algebras or the dimensions of
representations.

backwards stationary and Hopf bifurcations, saddle node bifurcations to stable
strongly nonlinear stationary and traveling wave (TW) states, and merging of
the TW solution branch with stationary states. Also unstable standing wave
solutions are obtained. A systematic analysis of the concentration balance for
liquid mixture parameters has lead to a representation of the concentration
field in terms of two linear and two nonlinear modes. This truncation captures
the important large--scale effects in the laterally averaged concentration
field resulting from advective and diffusive mixing. Also the fact that with
increasing flow intensity along the TW solution branch the frequency decreases
monotonically in the same way as the mixing increases --- the variance of the
concentration distribution decreases --- is ensured and reproduced well.
Universal scaling relations between flow intensity, frequency, and variance of
the concentration distribution (degree of mixing) in a TW are predicted by the
model and have been confirmed by numerical solutions of the full equations. The

developed recently to describe the evolution of a quantum system interacting
with a reservoir. As opposed to the usual reduced density operator approach,
which refers to ensemble averages, these methods deal with the dynamics of
single realizations, and involve the solution of stochastic Schr\""odinger
equations. These procedures have been shown to be completely equivalent to the
master equation approach when ensemble averages are taken over many
realizations. We show that these techniques are not only convenient
mathematical tools for dissipative systems, but may actually correspond to
concrete physical processes, for any temperature of the reservoir. We consider
a mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity interacting with a beam of two-
or three-level atoms, the field mode playing the role of a small system and the
atomic beam standing for a reservoir at finite temperature, the interaction
between them being given by the Jaynes-Cummings model. We show that the
evolution of the field states, under continuous monitoring of the state of the
atoms which leave the cavity, can be described in terms of either the Monte
Carlo Wave-Function (quantum jump) method or a stochastic Schr\""odinger
equation, depending on the system configuration. We also show that the Monte
Carlo Wave-Function approach leads, for finite temperatures, to localization
into jumping Fock states, while the diffusion equation method leads to
localization into states with a diffusing average photon number, which for
sufficiently small temperatures are close approximations to mildly squeezed
states.

possible outcomes. This family, called the posterior states, is usually a
family of the eigenstates of the measured observable, but it can be an
arbitrary family of states by controlling the object-apparatus interaction. A
potentially realizable object-apparatus interaction measures position in such a
way that the posterior states are the translations of an arbitrary wave
function. In particular, position can be measured without perturbing the object
in a momentum eigenstate.

  modified. It is shown that the in the case of ideal experiments, the
  inequality derived in this paper is equivalent to Bell's original inequality
  of 1965 which, as is well known, is violated by a factor of 1.5. The crucial
  point is that even in the case of real experiments where polarizers and
  detectors are non-ideal, the present inequality is violated by a factor of
  1.5, whereas previous inequalities such as CHSH inequality of 1969 and CH
  inequality of 1974 are violated by a factor of $\sqrt 2$",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A correlation inequality is derived from local realism and a supplementary
assumption. This inequality is violated by a factor of 1.5 in the case of real
experiments, whereas previous inequalities such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality of 1969 and Clauser-Horne inequality of 1974 are violated by a
factor of $\sqrt 2$. Thus the magnitude of violation of this inequality is
approximately 20.7% larger than the magnitude of violation of previous
inequalities. Moreover, the present inequality can be used to test locality
very simply because it requires the measurements of only two detection
probabilities. In contrast, Clauser-Horne inequality requires the measurements
of five detection probabilities.
