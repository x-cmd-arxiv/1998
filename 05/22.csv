90 degrees. This abrupt change in polarization direction is not necessarily the
signpost of a twisted magnetic field. Rather, in this localized region
processes other than the usual Davis-Greenstein mechanism might align the dust
grains with their long axes parallel with the field, orthogonal to their normal

distribution is assumed to be dominated by synchrotron losses, and the energy-
and time-dependence of the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
fluxes are calculated for a power-law electron injection function with index s
= 2. The mean time of a flare or pulse measured at photon energy E with respect
to the onset of the injection event varies as E^{-1/2} and E^{-1/4} for
synchrotron and SSC processes, respectively, until the time approaches the
limiting intrinsic mean time (1+z)dt/(2 D), where z is the redshift and D is
the Doppler factor. This dependence is in accord with recent analyses of blazar
and GRB emissions, and suggests a method to discriminate between external
Compton and SSC models of high-energy gamma radiation from blazars and GRBs.
The qualititative behavior of the X-ray spectral index/flux relation observed
from BL Lac objects can be explained with this model. This demonstrates that
synchrotron losses are primarily responsible for the X-ray variability behavior
and strengthens a new test for beaming from correlated hard X-ray/TeV

can play in constraining the formation history of rich cluster galaxies.
  Firstly, we consider the colour evolution of galaxies after star formation
ceases. We show that the scatter of the CMR places a strong constraint on the
spread in age of the bulk of the stellar population. However, although the bulk
of stars must be formed in a short period, continuing formation of stars in a
fraction of the galaxies is not so strongly constrained.
  We examine a model in which star formation occurs over an extended period of
time in most galaxies. An extension of this type of star formation history
allows us to reconcile the small present-day scatter of the CMR with the
observed blue galaxy fractions of intermediate redshift galaxy clusters.
  Secondly, the CMR can also be used to constrain the degree of merging between
pre-existing stellar systems. This test relies on the slope of the CMR. We show
that random mergers between galaxies very rapidly remove any well-defined CMR.
However, we prefer to examine the merger process using a self-consistent merger
tree. In such a model there are two effects: massive galaxies preferentially
merge with systems of similar mass; and the rate of mass growth is considerably
smaller than for the random merger case. As a result of both of these effects,
the CMR persists through a larger number of merger steps. The passive evolution
of galaxy colours and their averaging in dissipationless mergers provide
opposing constraints on the formation of cluster galaxies in a hierarchical
model; but at the level of current constraints, a compromise solution appears
possible.

interpret observations of tidally disturbed satellites around the Milky Way.
When analysing the simulations from the viewpoint of an observer, we find a
break in the slope of the star count and velocity dispersion profiles in our
models at the location where unbound stars dominate. We conclude that
`extra-tidal' stars and enhanced velocity dispersions observed in the outskirts
of Galactic satellites are due to contamination by stellar debris from the
tidal interaction with the Milky Way. However, a significant bound population
can exist beyond the break radius and we argue that it should not be identified
with the tidal radius of the satellite. We also develop and test a method for
determining the mass loss rate from a Galactic satellite using its extra-tidal
population. We apply this method to observations of globular clusters and dwarf
spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way, and conclude that a significant
fraction of both satellite systems are likely be destroyed within the next
Hubble time. Finally, we demonstrate that this mass loss estimate allows us to
place some limits on the initial mass function (IMF) of stars in a cluster from
the radial dependence of its present day mass function (PDMF).

that the new distribution of velocity widths includes values out to a maximum
of nearly 300 km/s, approx 100 km/s greater than the previous maximum. These
high velocity width systems will significantly leverage models introduced to
explain the damped lya systems. Comparing the characteristics from low-redshift

conclusions of our first paper. In particular, those models inconsistent with
the damped lya observations in Paper I are ruled out at even higher levels of
confidence. At the same time, the observations are consistent with a population
of rapidly rotating, thick disks (the TRD model) at high redshift.
  Buoyed by the success of the TRD model, we investigate it more closely by
considering more realistic disk properties. Our goal is to demonstrate the
statistical power of the damped lya observations by investigating the
robustness of the TRD model. In particular, we study the effects of warping,
realistic rotation curves, and photoionization on the kinematics of disks in
the TRD model. The principal results are: (1) disk warping has only minimal
effect on the kinematic results, primarily influencing the effective disk
thickness, (2) the TRD model is robust to more realistic rotation curves; (3)
the effects of photoionization require thicker disks to give consistent

$B$, $K_y$, and $K$ in a model that includes fluctuations perpendicular to the

dimensional regularization rather than a hard-cutoff renormalization scheme

quadratic polynomials, we study the one-dimensional slice of the cubic
polynomials which have a fixed Siegel disk of rotation number theta, with theta
being a given irrational number of Brjuno type. Our main goal is to prove that
when theta is of bounded type, the boundary of the Siegel disk is a quasicircle
which contains one or both critical points of the cubic polynomial. We also
prove that the locus of all cubics with both critical points on the boundary of
their Siegel disk is a Jordan curve, which is in some sense parametrized by the
angle between the two critical points. A main tool in the bounded type case is
a related space of degree 5 Blaschke products which serve as models for our
cubics. Along the way, we prove several results about the connectedness locus
of these cubic polynomials.

protons from nuclei ranging in mass from 6Li to 238U have been defined by
folding a complex, medium dependent effective interaction with the density
matrix elements of each target. The effective interaction is based upon
solutions of the Lippmann--Schwinger and Brueckner--Bethe--Goldstone equations
having the Paris potential as input. The nuclear structure information required
in our folding model are the one body density matrix elements for the target
and the single nucleon bound state wave functions that they weight. For light
mass nuclei, very large basis shell model calculations have been made to obtain
the one body density matrix elements. For medium and heavy mass nuclei, a very
simple shell model prescription has been used. The bound state single particle
wave functions that complete the nuclear density matrices are either
Woods--Saxon or harmonic oscillator functions. The former are employed in most
cases when large basis structure is available. For light nuclei (A < 16)
Woods--Saxon potential parameters and harmonic oscillator lengths are
determined from fits to electron scattering form factors. For all other nuclei,
we use harmonic oscillator functions with the oscillator lengths set from an
A^{1/6} mass law. Using this microscopic model, optical potentials result from
which differential cross sections, analyzing powers and spin rotations are
found. In general the calculated results compare very well with data when the
effective interactions are determined from a mapping of nucleon--nucleon g
matrices. This is not the case when effective interactions built from a mapping
of (free) t matrices are used.

different contexts. The hierarchy is realized as a Cayley-tree. Two different
ways of stress propagation in the tree are considered. In both cases, coherence
arises in large subsystems of the tree. Clear similarities between the behavior
of the tree model and of the coherent-noise model can be observed. For one of
the two methods of stress propagation, the behavior of the tree model can be
approximated very well by an ensemble of coherent-noise models, where the sizes
$k$ of the systems in the ensemble scale as $k^{-2}$. The results are found to
be independent of the tree's structure for a large class of reasonable choices.

variables that will generally become effectively classical are the local
densities (number, momentum, energy). That is, in the context of the decoherent
histories approach to quantum theory, it is expected that histories of these
variables will be approximately decoherent, and that their probabilites will be
strongly peaked about hydrodynamic equations. This possibility is explored for
the case of the diffusion of the number density of a dilute concentration of
foreign particles in a fluid. This system has the appealing feature that the
microscopic dynamics of each individual foreign particle is readily obtained
and the approach to local equilibrium may be seen explicitly. It is shown that,
for certain physically reasonable initial states, the probabilities for
histories of number density are strongly peaked about evolution according to
the diffusion equation. Decoherence of these histories is also shown for a
class of initial states which includes non-trivial superpositions of number
density. Histories of phase space densities are also discussed. The case of
histories of number, momentum and energy density for more general systems, such
as a dilute gas, is also discussed in outline. When the initial state is a
local equilibrium state, it is shown that the histories are trivally
decoherent, and that the probabilities for histories are peaked about
hydrodynamic equations. An argument for decoherence of more general initial
states is given.

time-symmetric, the rigged Hilbert space formulation, which arose from Dirac's
bra-ket formalism, allows the choice of asymmetric boundary conditions
analogous to the retarded solutions of the Maxwell equations for the radiation
arrow of time. This led to irreversibility on the microphysical level as
exemplified by decaying states or resonances. Resonances are mathematically
represented by Gamow kets, functionals over a space of very well-behaved (Hardy
class) vectors, which have been chosen by a boundary condition (outgoing for
decaying states). Gamow states have all the properties that one heuristically
needs for quasistable states. For them a Golden Rule can be derived from the
fundamental probabilities that fulfills the time-asymmetry condition which
could not be realized in the Hilbert space.

were once thought to exist: There are ways of finding out what is the pointer
state of the system which utilize redundancy of their correlations with the
environment, and which leave einselected states essentially unperturbed. This
relatively objective existence of certain quantum states facilitates
operational definition of probabilities in the quantum setting. Moreover, once
there are states that `exist' and can be `found out', a `collapse' in the
traditional sense is no longer necessary --- in effect, it has already
happened. The records of the observer will contain evidence of an effective
collapse. The role of the preferred states in the processing and storage of
information is emphasized. The existential interpretation based on the
relatively objective existence of stable correlations between the einselected
states of observers memory and in the outside Universe is formulated and
discussed.
