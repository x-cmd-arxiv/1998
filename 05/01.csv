components. The specialization at the level of the microscopic degrees of

appear during the course of evolution of the system. We present a mathematical
model to describe these evolutionary phenomena in economic communities. The
model is a generalization of the replicator equation. The economic motivation
for the model and its relationship with some other game theoretic models
applied to ecology and sociobiology is discussed. Some results about the
attractors of this dynamical system are described. We argue that while the
microscopic variables -- the agents comprising the community -- act locally and
independently, time evolution produces a collective behaviour in the system
characterized by individual specialization of the agents as well as global
diversity in the community. This occurs for generic values of the parameters
and initial conditions provided the community is sufficiently large, and can be
viewed as a kind of self-organization in the system. The context dependence of
acceptable innovations in the community appears naturally in this framework.

remnant of a tailed radio galaxy, in which the nuclear engine has switched off
and the radio source is now at a late stage of its evolution, confined by the
intracluster gas. The radio galaxy is not in pressure equilibrium with the
external medium, as it is often found for extended radio sources in clusters of
galaxies. We favour the hypothesis that the lack of observed polarised radio
emission in the source is due to Faraday rotation by a foreground screen, i.e.
the source is seen through a dense cluster gas, characterised by a random
magnetic field. An implication of the head-tail nature of the source is that
J1324-3138 is moving away from the core of A3556 and that possibly a major

larger than 0.04 pc, to binary (and occasionally higher multiple) systems on
smaller scales, which Larson has deduced from his analysis of the grouping of
pre-Main-Sequence stars in Taurus, arises because pre-protostellar gas becomes
thermally coupled to dust at sufficiently high densities. The resulting change
from gas-cooling by molecular lines at low densities to gas-cooling by dust at
high densities enables the matter to radiate much more efficiently, and hence
to undergo dynamical fragmentation.
  We derive the domain where gas-cooling by dust facilitates dynamical
fragmentation. Low-mass (i.e. solar mass) clumps - those supported mainly by
thermal pressure - can probably access this domain spontaneously, albeit rather
quasistatically, provided they exist in a region where external perturbations
are few and far between. More massive clumps probably require an impulsive
external perturbation, for instance a supersonic collision with another clump,
in order for the gas to reach sufficiently high density to couple thermally to
the dust. Impulsive external perturbations should promote fragmentation, by
generating highly non-line ar substructures which can then be amplified by
gravity during the subsequent collapse.

behaviours. Basically, at small values of the perturbation we recover the usual
(microscopic) Lyapunov exponent, while at larger values a sort of macroscopic
Lyapunov exponent emerges, which can be much smaller than the former. A
quantitative characterization of the chaotic motion at hydrodynamical level is
then possible, even in the absence of the explicit equations for the time

acceleration of the charge carriers as well as dissipative currents.
Dissipation dominates at low frequencies and the real part of the conductivity
greatly exceeds the normal state conductivity. These dissipative currents have

integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this

been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent
iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of

frame of reference, and assume the flat structures of gravity-free space and
time in the primed inertial coordinate system and their generalized Finslerian
structures in the usual inertial coordinate system. Combining this alternative
assumption with (i) and (ii), we modify the special theory of relativity. The
modified theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite speed c' in
the primed inertial coordinate system and finite speed c in the usual inertial
coordinate system. It involves the c'-type Galilean transformation between two
primed inertial coordinate systems and the localized Lorentz transformation
between two corresponding usual inertial coordinate systems. It also involves a
new physical principle. This principle is applied to reform of mechanics, field
theory and quantum field theory. The validity of relativistic mechanics in the
usual inertial coordinate system remains, while field theory is freshened.
Based on the establishment of a transformation law for the quantized field
systems, we construct a convergent and invariant quantum field theory, in full
agreement with experimental facts, founded on the modified special relativity
theory and the quantum mechanics theory.
