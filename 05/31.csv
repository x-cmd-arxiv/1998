in terms of a revised mass-radius relation for the lower main sequence. We show
that no such thermal-equilibrium relation is likely to produce a true gap.
Using population synthesis techniques we calculate a model population that
obeys the claimed equilibrium mass-radius relation. A theoretical period
histogram obtained from this population shows two prominent period spikes
rather than a gap. We consider also recent arguments suggesting that the period
gap itself may not be real. We argue that, far from demonstrating a weakness of
the interrupted-braking picture, the fact that most CV subtypes prefer one side
of the gap or the other is actually an expected consequence of it.

Vol. 109, 9888 (1998)","10.1063/1.477657",,"cond-mat.stat-mech physics.chem-ph",,"  The Kramers problem in the energy-diffusion limited regime of very low
friction is difficult to deal with analytically becasue of the repeated
recrossings of the barrier that typically occur before an asymptotic rate
constant is achieved. Thus, the transmission coefficient of particles over the
potential barrier undergoes oscillatory behavior in time before settling into a
steady state. Recently Kohen and Tannor (JCP Vol. 103, Pg. 6013, 1995)
developed a method based on the phase space distribution function to calculate
the transmission coefficient as a function of time in the high-friction regime.
Here we formulate a parallel method for the low-friction regime. We find
analytic results for the full time and temperature dependence of the rate
coefficient in this regime. Our low-friction result at long times reproduces
the equilibrium result of Kramers at very low friction and extends it to higher
friction and lower temperatures below the turn-over region. Our results
indicate that the single most important quantity in determining the entire time
evolution of the transmission coefficient is the rate of energy loss of a
particle that starts above the barrier. We test our resutls, as well as those
of Kohen and Tannor for the Kramers problem, against detailed numerical
simulations.

conformal gravity, i.e. the theory described by a Lagrangian which involves the
quadratic curvature invariant constructed from the Weyl tensor, in four
dimensions. We derive the explicit forms of the super-Hamiltonian and the
constraint expressing the conformal invariance of the theory, and we write down
the system of canonical equations. To seek out exact solutions to this system
we add extra constraints on the canonical variables and we go through a global
involution algorithm that possibly leads to the closure of the constraint
algebra. This enables us to extract all possible particular solutions that may
be written in closed analytical form. On the other hand, probing the local
analytical structure we show that the system does not possess the Painleve
property (presence of movable logarithms) and that it is therefore not
integrable. We stress that there is a very fruitful interplay of local
integrability-related methods such as the Painleve test and global techniques
such as the involution algorithm. Strictly speaking, we demonstrate that the
global involution algorithm has proven to be exhaustive in the search for exact
solutions. The conformal relationship of the solutions, or absence thereof,
with Einstein spaces is highlighted.

singularities appearing in the renormalized equations are removed by a
Bogoliubov transformation. The equations are then generalized to those in a
spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe.
  We have implemented the Minkowski space equations numerically and present
results for the time evolution with various parameter sets. We find that
fermion fluctuations are not in general as ineffective as assumed previously

interesting example we find that fermionic fluctuations can ``catalyze'' the

by $N \times N$ matrices, in the planar limit $N \to \infty$. Examples are
gauge theoires and the M(atrix)-theory of strings. States invariant under U(N)
are `closed strings', modelled by traces of products of matrices. We have
discovered that the U(N)-invariant opertors acting on both open and closed
string states form a remarkable new Lie algebra which we will call the heterix
algebra. (The simplest special case, with one degree of freedom, is an
extension of the Virasoro algebra by the infinite-dimensional general linear
algebra.) Furthermore, these operators acting on closed string states only form
a quotient algebra of the heterix algebra. We will call this quotient algebra
the cyclix algebra. We express the Hamiltonian of some gauge field theories
(like those with adjoint matter fields and dimensionally reduced pure QCD
models) as elements of this Lie algebra. Finally, we apply this cyclix algebra
to establish an isomorphism between certain planar matrix models and quantum
spin chain systems. Thus we obtain some matrix models solvable in the planar
limit; e.g., matrix models associated with the Ising model, the XYZ model,
models satisfying the Dolan-Grady condition and the chiral Potts model. Thus
our cyclix Lie algebra described the dynamical symmetries of quantum spin chain
systems, large-N gauge field theories, and the M(atrix)-theory of strings.

lead to consistent reflection matrices. Using the boundary bootstrap equations
we also compute the reflection factors for scalar bound states (breathers).

particles in a_2^(1) affine Toda field theory and we therefore obtain a
conjecture for the affine Toda reflection factors. We compare these factors
with known classical results and discuss their duality properties and their
