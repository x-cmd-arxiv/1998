  --Rotation curve fits-","Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal 14 pages",,"10.1086/306390",,"astro-ph",,"  We present MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) fits to 15 rotation curves of
LSB galaxies. Good fits are readily found, although for a few galaxies minor
adjustments to the inclination are needed. Reasonable values for the stellar
mass-to-light ratios are found, as well as an approximately constant value for
the total (gas and stars) mass-to-light ratio. We show that the LSB galaxies
investigated here lie on the one, unique Tully-Fisher relation, as predicted by
MOND. The scatter on the Tully-Fisher relation can be completely explained by
the observed scatter in the total mass-to-light ratio. We address the question
of whether MOND can fit any arbitrary rotation curve by constructing a
plausible fake model galaxy. While MOND is unable to fit this hypothetical
galaxy, a normal dark halo fit is readily found, showing that dark matter fits
are much less selective in producing fits. The good fits to rotation curves of
LSB galaxies support MOND, especially as these are galaxies with large mass
discrepancies deep in the MOND regime.

characteristics and the time dependence of the magnetic flux have been

approach, and we suggest that Poincar\'e transformations for special
relativistic systems can be understood as residual gauge transformations. In

Maxwell fields in a nondynamical background (with zero currents). We also

caused by losses at the top and the bottom attachments of each suspension

positioning of the laser beam spot on the mirror face it is possible to reduce
the contribution of the bottom attachment point to the suspension noise by
several orders of magnitude. For example, for the initial and enhanced LIGO
design parameters (i.e. mirror masses and sizes, and suspension fibers' lengths
and diameters) we predict a reduction of $\sim 100$ in the ""bottom"" spectral
density throughout the band $35-100\hbox{Hz}$ of serious thermal noise. We then
propose a readout scheme which suppresses the suspension noise contribution of
the top attachment point. The idea is to monitor an averaged horizontal
displacement of the fiber of length $ l$; this allows one to record the
contribution of the top attachment point to the suspension noise, and later
subtract it it from the interferometer readout. For enhanced LIGO this would
allow a suppression factor about 100 in spectral density of suspension thermal
noise.

Solar and atmospheric neutrinos traversing the earth pass through layers of
alternating density and can therefore experience parametric resonance of their
oscillations. Atmospheric neutrinos can undergo parametrically enhanced
oscillations in the earth when their trajectories deviate from the vertical by
about $26^\circ - 32^\circ$. Solar neutrinos traversing the earth can
experience a strong parametric resonance of their oscillations in a wide range
of zenith angles. If the small mixing angle MSW effect is the solution of the
solar neutrino problem, the oscillations of solar neutrinos crossing the core
of the earth {\em must} undergo strong parametric resonance; this phenomenon
should facilitate significantly the observation of the day-night effect in
oscillations of solar neutrinos. If observed, the enhanced day-night effect for
core crossing neutrinos would therefore confirm both the MSW solution of the
solar neutrino problem and the parametric resonance of neutrino oscillations.
