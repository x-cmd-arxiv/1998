of 86 Am stars. Both have been observed with the CORAVEL scanner from
Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS), France.
  The conspicuous lack of short-period binaries among cool Ap stars seems
confirmed, although this may be the result of an observational bias; one system
has a period as short as 1.6 days. A dozen new orbits could be determined,
including that of one SB2 system. Considering the mass functions of 68 binaries
from the literature and from our work, we conclude that the distribution of the
mass ratios is the same for the Bp-Ap stars than for normal G dwarfs.
  Among the Am stars, we found 52 binaries, i.e. 60%; an orbit could be
computed for 29 of them. Among these 29, there are 7 SB2 systems, one triple
and one quadruple system. The 21 stars with an apparently constant radial
velocity may show up later as long-period binaries with a high eccentricity.
The mass functions of the SB1 systems are compatible with cool main-sequence
companions, also suggested by ongoing spectral observations.

About 70% of the objects have been detected in X-rays for the first time. We
present the soft X-ray fluxes and spectra, if available. Using an optically
selected subsample compiled from this database, we study the broad band
properties of radio-quiet quasars with high statistical significance. We
confirm that radio-quiet quasars have in general steeper soft X-ray spectra
than radio-loud. The spectral differences persist to high redshifts. A spectral
flattening with increasing redshift is confirmed up to redshift around 2,
beyond which the spectral slopes seem to be independent of redshift. The
spectral slopes of the ROSAT radio-quiet quasars at z>2.5 are consistent with
those found for nearby quasars in the medium energy band (2-10keV), implying
that the X-ray spectral evolution is not important. We show that there is, in a
statistical sense, little or no excess absorption for most of the radio-quiet
objects at z>2. The existence of a correlation between the X-ray luminosity and
the luminosity at 2500A is confirmed. Individual objects show a large scatter
from this correlation. The X-ray loudness alpha_ox appears to be independent of
z, but the analyses indicate a slight increase of alpha_ox with optical
luminosity. However, this behavior is likely not caused by physical properties
inherent to the quasars but is the result of the intrinsic dispersion. Finally,
we find a small fraction of objects which appear to be relatively `X-ray quiet'
compared to the bulk of the other quasars.

of the kinetic temperature in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic
field, for both isotropic and anisotropic temperature distributions, affects
both the amount of Doppler dimming and pumping. Taking this component into

  In this paper, we present simulation results that point to the existence of

a new phenomenon in heterogeneous highway traffic. As the density of vehicles
increases, their interactions cause a transition into a highly correlated state
in which all vehicles practically move with the same speed, analogous to the

The quantum
group $U_h(\hat{\frak g})$ (over $\mathbb{C}[[h]]$) is known to be a
quasitriangular Hopf algebra: in particular, it has a universal $ R $--matrix,
which yields an $ R $--matrix for each pair of representations of
$U_h(\hat{\frak g})$. On the other hand, the quantum group $U_q(\hat{\frak g})$
(over $\mathbb{C}(q) $) also has an $ R $--matrix for each pair of
representations, but it has not a universal $ R $--matrix so that one cannot
say that it is quasitriangular. Following Reshetikin, one introduces the
(weaker) notion of braided Hopf algebra: then $ U_q(\hat{\frak g})$ is a
braided Hopf algebra.
  In this work we prove that also the unrestricted specializations of
$U_q(\hat{\frak g})$ at roots of 1 are braided: in particular, specializing $q$
at 1 we have that the function algebra $F \big[ \hat{H} \big]$ of the Poisson
proalgebraic group $\hat{H}$ dual of $\hat{G}$ (a Kac-Moody group with Lie
algebra $\hat{\frak g} \,$) is braided. This is useful because, despite these
specialized quantum groups are not quasitriangular, the braiding is enough for
applications, mainly for producing knot invariants. As an example, the action
of the $ R $--matrix on (tensor products of) Verma modules can be specialized
at odd roots of 1.
