were reionized at 5 < z < 60. It is likely that this transition proceeded
through a mixed phase of partial ionization. We develop an analytic approach to
calculating the effect on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) of Thomson
scattering off this inhomogeneous distribution of free electrons. We study two
models of the reionization process, one of which associates ionized patches
with overdense regions of the smoothed density field. We find the generated
anisotropy to have a power spectrum which peaks at angular scales corresponding
to the extent of the ionized regions, and has a width that reflects the
correlations between them. There is considerable uncertainty in the amplitude,
which depends on how efficiently collapsed objects can reionize the surrounding
medium. We calculate the effect of neglecting inhomogeneous reionization in the
determination of cosmological parameters from high resolution CMB maps and find
that it may be a significant source of systematic error.

turbulent ISM at large scales suggest that the phase-like appearance of the
medium, the typical values of the densities and magnetic field strengths in the
intercloud medium, as well as the velocity dispersion-size scaling relation in
clouds may be understood as consequences of the interstellar turbulence.
However, the density-size relation appears to only hold for the densest clouds,
suggesting that low-column density clouds, which are hardest to observe, are
turbulent transients. We then explore some properties of highly compressible
polytropic turbulence, in one and several dimensions, applicable to molecular
cloud scales. At low values of the polytropic index $\gamma$, turbulence may
induce the gravitational collapse of otherwise linearly stable clouds, except
if they are magnetically subcritical. The nature of the density fluctuations in
the high Mach-number limit depends on $\gamma$, and in no case resembles that
resulting from Burgers turbulence. In the isothermal ($\gamma=1$) case, the
dispersion of $\ln (\rho)$ scales like the turbulent Mach number. The latter
case is singular with a lognormal density pdf, while power-law tails develop at
high (resp. low) densities for $\gamma <1$ (resp. $\gamma >1$).

most of determinations of the mass density have been dynamical, hence sensitive
only to matter which is clustered at or below the scale of the observed
dynamical systems. The density may still be critical if there is a dark matter
component which is relatively smooth on the scales of galaxies or clusters.
Thoughts on this matter have focused on the possibility of an effective
cosmological constant or vacuum energy. In this letter we examine an
alternative possibility - that there is a second component to the dark matter
which has a repulsive self-interaction. We show that given even very weak

and infra-red light curves of the 1975/1976 outburst of the famous black-hole
transient A0620-00 (Nova Mon 1975, V616 Mon). During the various stages of its
outburst the X-rays lag the optical by ~5-20 days. Moreover, the activity
associated with the secondary maximum started even earlier in the infra-red.
This suggests that most of the outburst processes occur in the outer parts of
the disk. We also find various drops in the X-ray intensity (lasting ~1 day or
more). Near one of these a local maximum in the optical light curve occurs.
This maximum appears ~30 days after the secondary maximum, i.e. close to the
viscous time scale of an irradiated disk. We suggest this feature to be an
`echo' of the secondary maximum. At the end of the outburst a similar local
optical maximum occurs, which might be an `echo' of the tertiary maximum. We
find that the drops in the optical and X-rays near the tertiary maximum are
also present in other SXTs. They always occur ~150 days after the start of the
outburst. We find for the first time that the X-ray spectrum of A0620-00 starts
to harden ~100-150 days after the start of its outburst, similar to GS2000+25
and GS1124-68. This suggests we witness the transition from the so-called high

A0620-00 closely resembles that of the cataclysmic variable AL Com. This
strengthens the similarity in the properties of the SXTs and TOADs (or WZ Sge
stars), and shows that the optical outburst light curves of both groups are
governed by the disk properties and not by the compact object. Since
irradiation provides a natural mechanism to prolong the outburst of SXTs, we
suggest this could be of influence as well during TOAD outbursts.

rotation rates form a separate Maxwellian distribution with an average value
3-4 times lower than the normal star distribution. No evidences for a
significant angular momentum (AM) loss on the main sequence (MS) have been
found. It is thus concluded that Ap stars must lose a large fraction of their
initial angular momentum (AM) in the pre-MS phase of evolution, most probably
as a result of the interaction of their primordial magnetic fields with
accretion disks and stellar winds. The observationally most acceptable values
of accretion rate from the disk, 10^(-8) M_sun/year, of mass loss rate via a
magnetized wind, 10^(-8) M_sun/year, and of the surface magnetic field, 1 kG on

  There exists a separate group of extremely slowly rotating Ap stars, with
periods of the order of 10-100 years. They are too numerous to come from the
distribution describing the bulk of Ap stars. It is conjectured that their
extremely low rotation rates are the result of additional AM loss on the MS.

reconstruction algorithm that can implicitly take into account the presence of
cluster galaxies. The method includes an entropy-like regularization
prescription and directly uses the ellipticities of individual source galaxy
images as observables rather than relying on an averaged ellipticity field. The
mass distribution of cluster galaxies is described by parametrized models. For
each set of galaxy parameters the cluster reconstruction algorithm allows to
determine the best representation of the global underlying cluster component

oscillating Ap stars have shown that the pulsation amplitude drops dramatically
as a function of wavelength from the blue to the red. A theoretical derivation,
plus modelling, indicates that this is because the vertical wavelength of the
pulsation mode is short compared to the scale height of the atmosphere; in
fact, it indicates that we are seeing a pulsation node in the observable
atmosphere. Radial velocity observations, and theoretical calculations now
support this. The implication for other research on CP stars is that this can
provide observational constraints on the atmospheric structure independent of
traditional spectral analysis. 2) Luminosities of roAp stars can be determined
from asteroseismology. A recent comparison of such asteroseismic luminosities
with HIPPARCOS luminosities is shown. This suggests that roAp stars have lower
temperatures and/or smaller radii than previous models have used, or that the
magnetic fields in these stars alter the frequency separations. 3) The latest
results of our long-term monitoring of the pulsation frequencies in certain
roAp stars are discussed. There is a clear cyclic variability to the pulsation
cavity, hence the sound speed and/or sound travel time (radius) of these stars.

measurements cannot currently detect, although there is no theoretical support

that new generation of X-ray telescopes combining very high sensitivity and

fluorescent line in the Sgr B2 and other molecular clouds in the region. We
note also that detection of broad and complex structures near the 6.4 keV line

presence of violent activity of the central engines of these objects in the

that an observer falling into a black hole with the collapsing star encounters
a crushing spacelike singularity, an observer falling in at late times
generally reaches a null singularity which is vastly different in character to
the standard Belinsky, Khalatnikov and Lifschitz (BKL) spacelike singularity.

understanding of spherical models, we argue that the Einstein equations reduce
to a simple form in the neighborhood of the null singularity. The main results
arising from this approach are demonstrated using an almost plane symmetric
model. The analysis shows that the null singularity results from the blueshift
of the late-time gravitational wave tail; the amplitude of these gravitational
waves is taken to decay as an inverse power of advanced time as suggested by
perturbation theory. The divergence of the Weyl curvature at the null
singularity is dominated by the propagating modes of the gravitational field.
The null singularity is weak in the sense that tidal distortion remains bounded
along timelike geodesics crossing the Cauchy horizon. These results are in
agreement with previous analyses of black hole interiors. We briefly discuss
some outstanding problems which must be resolved before the picture of the
generic black hole interior is complete.

gravitational and matter phase space variables, the Thiemann transform is
equivalent to the composition of an inverse Wick rotation and a constant
complex scale transformation of all fields. This result holds as well for
functions that depend on the shift vector, the lapse function, and the Lagrange
multipliers of the Yang-Mills and gravitational Gauss constraints, provided
that the Wick rotation is implemented by means of an analytic continuation of
the lapse. In this way, the Thiemann transform is furnished with a geometric

a simple explanation for this fact.

disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) in a heavy-ion collision. In our scenario,
rapid initial heating of the parton system provides a driving force for the
chiral field, moving it away from the true vacuum and forcing it to go to the
opposite point on the vacuum manifold. This converts the entire hot region into
a single DCC domain. Subsequent rolling down of the chiral field to its true
vacuum will then lead to emission of a large number of (approximately) coherent
pions. The requirement of suppression of thermal fluctuations to maintain the
(approximate) coherence of such a large DCC domain, favors three dimensional
expansion of the plasma over the longitudinal expansion even at very early
stages of evolution. This also constrains the maximum temperature of the system
to lie within a window. We roughly estimate this window to be about 200 - 400
MeV. These results lead us to predict that extremely high energy collisions of
{\it very small nuclei} (possibly hadrons) are better suited for observing
signatures of a large DCC. Another possibility is to focus on {\it peripheral}
collisions of heavy nuclei.

The Hamiltonians or Lagrangians characterizing these theories can contain
higher derivative terms. In the operator approach, we show that the free theory
is essentially the unique abelian theory with up to four derivatives in the
following sense: any small deformation of the free theory, which preserves the
supersymmetries, can be gauged away by a unitary conjugation. We also present a
method for deriving constraints on terms appearing in an effective Lagrangian.
We apply this method to the effective Lagrangian describing the dynamics of two
well-separated clusters of D0-branes. As a result, we prove a
non-renormalization theorem for the $v^4$ interaction.

by hand. Developing further some ideas of F. Xu, our treatment leads
canonically to certain fusion graphs, and in all our examples we rediscover the

corresponding SU(n) modular invariants. We establish a connection between
exponents of these graphs and the appearance of characters in the
block-diagonal modular invariants, provided that the extended modular
S-matrices diagonalize the endomorphism fusion rules of the extended theories.
This is proven for many cases, and our results cover all the block-diagonal
SU(2) modular invariants, thus provide some explanation of the A-D-E

computed in chiral colour dielectric model. This has been done by rearranging
the Lippmann-Schwinger series for the meson baryon scattering matrix so that it
can be expressed as a baryon pole term with renormalized form factors and
baryon masses and the rest of the terms which arise from the crossed diagrams.
Thus we are able to obtain an integral equation for the renormalized
meson-baryon form factors in terms of the bare form factors as well as an
expression for the meson self energy. This integral equation is solved and
renormalized meson baryon form factors and renormalized baryon masses are
computed. The parameters of the model are adjusted to obtain a best fit to the
physical baryon masses. The calculations show that the renormalized form
factors are energy-dependent and differ from the bare form factors primarily at
momentum transfers smaller than 1 GeV. At nucleon mass, the change in the form
factors is about 10% at zero momentum transfer. The computed form factors are
soft with the equivalent monopole cut-off mass of about 500 MeV. The
renormalized coupling constants are obtained by comparing the chiral colour
dielectric model interaction Hamiltonian with the standard form of
meson-nucleon interaction Hamiltonian. The ratio of $\Delta N\pi$ and $NN\pi$
coupling constants is found to be about 2.15. This value is very close to the
experimental value.

higher energies this observation has been interpreted as a sign of a strong
radial flow in an otherwise thermalized system. Investigating the reaction with
Quantum Molecular dynamics simulations we find in between 50A MeV and 200A MeV
a change in the reaction mechanism. At 50A MeV the apparent radial flow is
merely caused by an in-plane flow and Coulomb repulsion. The average transverse
fragment energy does not change in the course of the reaction and is equal to
the initial fragment energy due to the Fermi motion. At 200A MeV, there are two
kinds of fragments: those formed from spectator matte r and those from the
center of the reaction. There the transverse energy is caused by the pr essure
from the compressed nuclear matter. In both cases we observe a binary event
stru cture, even in central collisions. This demonstrates as well the non
thermal character of the reaction. The actual process which leads to
multifragmentation is rather complex and is discussed in detail.

critically examined, and generalized. Earlier criticisms of the idea are
discussed and their relevance to the proposal assessed. Several constraints on
measuring apparatus required by ""protective"" measurements are discussed, with
emphasis on how they may restrict their experimental feasibility. Though
""protective"" measurements result in an unchanged system state and a shift of
the pointer proportional to the expectation value of the measured observable in
the system state, the actual reading of the pointer position gives rise to
several subtleties. We propose several schemes for reading pointer position,
both when the apparatus is treated as a classical system as well as when its
quantum aspects are taken into account, that address these issues. The tiny
entanglement which is always present due to deviation from extreme adiabaticity
in realistic situations is argued to be the weakest aspect of the proposal.
Because of this, one can never perform a protective measurement on a single
quantum system with absolute certainty. This clearly precludes an ontological
status for the wave function. Several other conceptual issues are also
discussed.
