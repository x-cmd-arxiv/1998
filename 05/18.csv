gravitational radiation reaction acting on the stars' $r$-modes, is shown here
to set an upper limit on the spin rate of young neutron stars. We calculate the
timescales for growth of linear perturbations due to gravitational radiation
reaction, and for dissipation by shear and bulk viscosity, working to second
order in a slow-rotation expansion within a Newtonian polytropic stellar model.
The results are very temperature-sensitive: in hot neutron stars ($T>10^9$ K),
the lowest-order $r$-modes are unstable, while in colder stars they are damped
by viscosity. These calculations have a number of interesting astrophysical
implications. First, the $r$-mode instability will spin down a newly born
neutron star to a period close to the initial period inferred for the Crab
pulsar, probably between 10 and 20 ms. Second, as an initially rapidly rotating
star star spins down, an energy equivalent to roughly 1% of a solar mass is
radiated as gravitational waves, which makes the process an interesting source
for detectable gravitational waves. Third, the $r$-mode instability rules out
the scenario whereby millisecond pulsars are formed by accretion-induced
collapse of a white dwarf: the new star would be hot enough to spin down to
much slower rates.

$GL(n,C)$ on local solutions of flows of the ZS-AKNS $sl(n,C)$-hierarchy. We
show that the actions of simple elements (linear fractional transformations)
give local B\""acklund transformations, and we derive a permutability formula
from different factorizations of a quadratic element. We prove that the action
of simple elements on the vacuum may give either global smooth solutions or
solutions with singularities. However, the action of the subgroup of the
rational maps that satisfy the U(n)-reality condition $g(\bar\l)^*g(\l)=I$ on
the space of global rapidly decaying solutions of the flows in the
$u(n)$-hierarchy is global, and the action of a simple element gives a global
B\""acklund transformation.
  The actions of certain elements in the rational loop group on the vacuum give
rise to explicit time periodic multi-solitons (multi-breathers). We show that
this theory generalizes the classical B\""acklund theory of the sine-Gordon
equation. The group structures of B\""acklund transformations for various
hierarchies are determined by their reality conditions. We identify the reality
conditions (the group structures) for the $sl(n,R)$, $u(k,n-k)$, KdV,
Kupershmidt-Wilson, and Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchies. The actions of linear
fractional transformations that satisfies a reality condition, modulo the
center of the group of rational maps, gives B\""acklund and Darboux
transformations for the hierarchy defined by the reality condition. Since the
factorization cannot always be carried out under these reality condition, the
action is again local, and B\""acklund transformations only generate local
solutions for these hierarchies unless singular solutions are allowed.

  253",,"formerly math.LA/9805076","math.RA math.NA",,"  The method of ``Total Least Squares'' is proposed as a more natural way (than
ordinary least squares) to approximate the data if both the matrix and and the
right-hand side are contaminated by ``errors''. In this tutorial note, we give
a elementary unified view of ordinary and total least squares problems and
their solution. As the geometry underlying the problem setting greatly
contributes to the understanding of the solution, we introduce least squares
problems and their generalization via interpretations in both column space and
(the dual) row space and we shall use both approaches to clarify the solution.
After a study of the least squares approximation for simple regression we
introduce the notion of approximation in the sense of ``Total Least Squares
(TLS)'' for this problem and deduce its solution in a natural way. Next we
consider ordinary and total least squares approximations for multiple
regression problems and we study the solution of a general overdetermined
system of equations in TLS-sense. In a final section we consider
generalizations with multiple right-hand sides and with ``frozen'' columns. We
remark that a TLS-approximation needs not exist in general; however, the line
(or hyperplane) of best approximation in TLS-sense for a regression problem
does exist always.

the basis of spatio-temporal pattern formation by local
contraction-oscillators. This biological system can be regarded as a
reaction-diffusion system which has spatial interaction by active flow of
protoplasmic sol in the cell. Paying attention to the physiological evidence
that the flow is determined by contraction pattern in the plasmodium, a
reaction-diffusion system having self-determined flow arises. Such a coupling
of reaction-diffusion-advection is a characteristic of the biological system,
and is expected to relate with control mechanism of amoeboid behaviours. Hence,
we have studied effects of the self-determined flow on pattern formation of
simple reaction-diffusion systems. By weakly nonlinear analysis near a trivial
solution, the envelope dynamics follows the complex Ginzburg-Landau type
equation just after bifurcation occurs at finite wave number. The flow term
affects the nonlinear term of the equation through the critical wave number
squared. Contrary to this, wave number isn't explicitly effective with lack of
flow or constant flow. Thus, spatial size of pattern is especially important
for regulating pattern formation in the plasmodium. On the other hand, the flow
term is negligible in the vicinity of bifurcation at infinitely small wave
number, and therefore the pattern formation by simple reaction-diffusion will
also hold. A physiological role of pattern formation as above is discussed.

representations (i.e. no interaction is introduced). It is shown that the mass
operator contains only continuous spectrum in the interval $(-\infty,\infty)$
and such representations are unitarily equivalent to ones describing
interactions (gravitational, electromagnetic etc.). This means that there are
no bound states in the theory and the Hilbert space of the many-particle system
contains a subspace of states with the following property: the action of free
representation operators on these states is manifested in the form of different
interactions. Possible consequences of the results are discussed.
