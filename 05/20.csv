polytropic disk to tidal forcing at Lindblad resonances by including the
effects of a disk atmosphere. The atmosphere is modeled as an isothermal layer
that joins smoothly on to an underlying polytropic layer. The launched wave
progressively enters the atmosphere as it propagates away from the resonance.
The wave never propagates vertically, however, and the wave energy rises to a
(finite) characteristic height in the atmosphere. The increase of wave
amplitude associated with this process of wave channeling is reduced by the
effect of the atmosphere. For waves of large azimuthal mode number m generated
by giant planets embedded in a disk, the increase in wave amplitude is still
substantial enough to be likely to dissipate the wave energy by shocks for even
modest optical depths (tau greater than about 10) over a radial distance of a
few times the disk thickness. For low-m waves generated in circumstellar disks
in binary stars, the effects of wave channeling are less important and the
level of wave nonlinearity increases by less than a factor of 10 in going from
the disk edge to the disk center. For circumbinary disks, the effects of wave
channeling remain important, even for modest values of optical depth.

expected number of quasars if massive black holes form with a constant
universal efficiency in all CDM halos. To reconcile the models with the data, a
mechanism is needed that suppresses the formation of quasars in halos with
circular velocities v(circ) < 50-75 km/s. This feedback naturally arises due to
the photoionization heating of the gas by the UV background. We consider
several alternative effects that would help reduce the quasar number counts,
and find that these can not alone account for the observed lack of detections.
If reddening by dust can be neglected at early epochs, consistency with the
optical data also requires that the luminous extent of dwarf galaxies at high
redshifts be larger than a few percent of the virial radii of their dark matter
halos, in order not to overpredict the number of point-like B-band dropouts.

  We find that taking into account of a circumbinary envelope leads to

steady-state self-consistent solutions show an absence of impact between gas
stream from the inner Lagrangian point L1 and forming accretion disc. The
stream deviates under the action of gas of circumbinary envelope, and does not
cause the shock perturbation of the disc boundary (traditional `hotspot'). At
the same time, the gas of circumbinary envelope interacts with the stream and
causes the formation of an extended shock wave, located on the stream edge. We
discuss the implication of this model without `hotspot' (but with a shock wave
located outside the disc) for interpretation of observations. The comparison of
synthetic light curves with observations proves the validity of the discussed
hydrodynamic model without `hotspot'.
  We also consider the influence of a circumbinary envelope on the mass
transfer rate in semidetached binaries. The obtained features of flow structure
in the vicinity of L1 show that the gas of circumbinary envelope plays an
important role in the flow dynamics, and that it leads to significant (in order
of magnitude) increasing of the mass transfer rate.

Redshift Survey (CFRS) for the purpose of examining whether the comoving number

into account the luminosity evolution of galaxies which depends on their
morphological type through different history of star formation, we obtain
<V/Vmax> \sim 0.5 in the range of 0.3<z<0.8, where reliable redshifts were
secured by spectroscopy of either absorption or emission lines for the CFRS

without significant mergers is consistent with the CFRS data. Early-type
galaxies, selected by their (V-I)_{AB} color, become unnaturally deficient in
number at z>0.8 due to the selection bias, thereby causing a fictitious
decrease of <V/Vmax>. We therefore conclude that a reasonable choice of upper
bound of redshift z \sim 0.8 in the V/Vmax test saves the picture of passive
evolution for field ellipticals in the CFRS sample, which was rejected by
Kauffman, Charlot, & White (1996) without confining the redshift range.

15 from $z$ = 0 to 1 inferred from UV observations is too steep to be

intrinsic luminosity dispersion of GRBs and/or modification of star formation

cosmological parameters and/or take account of the evolution of metallicity and
dust extinction in the UV data, and this would significantly remedy the

a factor of \sim (m_p/m_e). We show that, in this case, very strong emission of

suggests a possibility that GRBs are most energetic in TeV range and such TeV

sections has been suggested as a promising probe of new small x dynamics and
the question is whether these data provide an indication of this. The same
question arises for other experimental data in deep inelastic scattering at
small x which can not be described by conventional models for deep inelastic
scattering. In this paper the influence of resolved photon processes has been
investigated and it has been studied to what extent such processes are able to

sufficient to describe effects, observed in the HERA data, which have been

test should be performed in the quantum regime and with sufficiently high
resolution so as to resolve small quantum efects.

structure embedded in a single-crystal solid, each ABC-unit can be used to
store quantum information and the information can be moved around via some
cellular shifting mechanism. Impurity doping marks a special site
D$\not\in{\cal L}$ which together with the local spin lattice constitute a
quantum automaton where the D site serves as the input/output port and
universal quantum logic is done through two-body interactions between two spins
at D and a nearby site. The novel NMR quantum computer can be easily scaled up
and may work at low temperature to overcome the problem of exponential decay in
signal-to-noise ratio in room temperature NMR.

diffusion, dispersion, and nonlinear effects, as well as its dependence on the
parity of the polynomials $P(u)$ and $A(u)$ with respect to the discrete
symmetry $u\to-u$. We analyze two types of kink soliton solutions, which are
also solutions to 1+1 dimensional phi^{4} and phi^{6} field theories.

XXC models also have an underlying su(2) structure. Their construction method
is shown to generalize to the chains based on the fundamental representations
of the A_m Lie algebras. Integrability of the new models is shown in the
context of the quantum inverse scattering method. Their R-matrix is found and
shown to yield a representation of the Hecke algebra. The diagonalization of
the transfer matrices is carried out using the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. I
comment on eventual generalizations and possible links to reaction-diffusion
processes.
