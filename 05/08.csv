reported. This is the lowest redshift quasar damped Lyman-alpha system known.
Its neutral hydrogen column density is N(HI) = 1.5(+/- 0.2) E21 atoms/cm^2,
which easily exceeds the classical criterion for damped Lyman-alpha of N(HI)
greater than or equal to 2E20 atoms/cm^2. Remarkably, a z_abs = 0.2212 damped
system with N(HI) = 7.9(+/- 1.4) E20 atoms/cm^2 has also been discovered in the

  In the past, the standard paradigm for damped Lyman-alpha systems has been
that they arise in galactic or protogalactic HI disks with low impact
parameters in luminous galaxies. However, WIYN imaging of the OI 363 field
shows that none of the galaxies visible in the vicinity of the quasar is a
luminous gas-rich spiral with low impact parameter, either at z = 0.0912 or z =
0.2212. Thus, these damped systems are among the clearest examples yet of cases
that are inconsistent with the standard damped Lyman-alpha - HI-disk paradigm.

determined by the angular momenta of their host haloes predicted in current
hierarchical clustering models for structure formation. Gas with low specific
angular momentum becomes self-gravitating and presumably forms stars before it
can settle into a rotationally supported disc. We assume this part of the gas
in a dark halo to form a bulge, while the rest is assumed to settle into a
rotationally supported disc. With these assumptions the predicted bulge-to-disc
ratios in mass and in size, and other correlations between the bulge and disc
components can match current observational results. This model predicts the
existence of a population of low-surface-brightness galaxies which are
bulgeless. The model also predicts that the bulge component has many properties
in common with the disc component, because both form through similar processes.
In particular, many bulges should be supported (at least partially) by
rotation.

silicon burning, the resultant \emph{QSE-reduced} \alpha network is twice as

an accurate approximation for all of the burning stages from He burning to NSE,
while tracking only 7 abundances. These reductions in computational cost and
the number of species evolved make the \alpha7 network well suited for
inclusion within hydrodynamic simulations, particularly those in

public-domain serial Adaptive P3M code of Couchman et al. The algorithm
resolves gravitational forces into a long-range component computed by
discretizing the mass distribution and solving Poisson's equation on a grid
using an FFT convolution method, and a short-range component computed by direct
force summation for sufficiently close particle pairs. The code consists
primarily of a particle-particle computation parallelized by domain
decomposition over blocks of neighbour-cells, a more regular mesh calculation
distributed in planes along one dimension, and several transformations between
the two distributions. The load balancing of the P3M code is static, since this
greatly aids the ongoing implementation of parallel adaptive refinements of the
particle and mesh systems. Great care was taken throughout to make optimal use
of the available memory, so that a version of the current implementation has
been used to simulate systems of up to 10^9 particles with a 1024^3 mesh for
the long-range force computation. These are the largest Cosmological N-body
simulations of which we are aware. We discuss these memory optimizations as
well as those motivated by computational performance. Performance results are
very encouraging, and, even without refinements, the code has been used
effectively for simulations in which the particle distribution becomes highly
clustered as well as for other non-uniform systems of astrophysical interest.

important tests of cosmological simulation methods, providing a realistically
complex problem in which numerical results can be compared to rigorous analytic
scaling laws. Previous studies of this problem have incorporated gravitational
dynamics and adiabatic gas dynamics, but radiative cooling, an essential
element of the physics of galaxy formation, normally violates the conditions
necessary for self-similar evolution. We show that for any specified value of
the initial power spectrum index n [where P(k)~k^n], there is a family of
power-law cooling functions that preserves self-similarity by ensuring that the
cooling time in an object of the characteristic mass M_* is a fixed fraction
t_C of the Hubble time. We perform hydrodynamic numerical simulations with an
Einstein-de Sitter cosmology, a baryon fraction of 5%, Gaussian initial
conditions, two different power spectrum indices, and four values of t_C for
each index, ranging from no cooling to strong cooling. We restrict the
numerical simulations to two dimensions in order to allow exploration of a wide
parameter space with adequate dynamic range. In all cases, the simulations are
remarkably successful at reproducing the analytically predicted scalings of the
mass function of dissipated objects and the gas temperature distributions and
cooled gas fractions in collapsed systems. While similar success with 3-D
simulations must still be demonstrated, our results have encouraging
implications for numerical studies of galaxy formation, indicating that
simulations with resolution comparable to that in many current studies can
accurately follow the collapse and dissipation of baryons into the dense, cold
systems where star formation is likely to occur.

2900 km/s and on the plane of the sky by 0.23 h^{-1} Mpc. A kinematic analysis
indicates that the two components are a poor cluster with a velocity dispersion
of 415 km/s and a less massive group with a velocity dispersion of 158 km/s
(Postman, Lubin & Oke 1998). An analytic two-body calculation and N-body
simulations indicate that the system is most likely not bound but simply a
chance projection on the sky; however, within the observational uncertainties,
there do exist bound solutions where the two galaxy groups are currently moving
toward each other and will eventually merge. A statistical analysis of 1000
N-body simulations indicates that there is an 20% chance that the two groups
will merge. If the CL0023+0423 system does merge, it will appear as a cluster
on the sky, as well as in velocity space, within 1-2 Gyrs. The cluster will
evolve dynamically for more than 3 Gyrs, appearing during this time more
similar to an open, irregular cluster. The final merged system has a velocity
dispersion which is consistent with a local Abell richness class 1 cluster. The
morphological analysis of the galaxy populations of CL0023+0423 suggests that
both groups are largely dominated by spiral galaxies with early-type fractions

QCD. If it exists, the inflationary universe produces axion fluctuations which
are mixtures of isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations in general. We
investigate how large isocurvature fluctuations are allowed or favored in order
to explain observations of the large scale structure of the present universe.
Generic flat universe models with mixed (isocurvature + adiabatic) density
fluctuations are studied. It is found that the observations are consistent with
the mixed fluctuation model if the ratio \alpha of the power spectrum of
isocurvature fluctuations to that of adiabatic fluctuations is less than \sim
0.1. In particular, the mixed fluctuation model with \alpha \sim 0.05, total
matter density \Omega_{0} =0.4, and Hubble parameter H_0=70 km/s/Mpc gives a
very good fit to the observational data. Since the height of the acoustic peak
in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation decreases significantly when the isocurvature fluctuations are
present, the mixed fluctuation model can be tested in future satellite
experiments. Ratios of the amplitude at the peak location to that at the COBE
normalization scale for various models are given. Furthermore, we also obtain
the amplitude of isocurvature fluctuations as a function of axion parameters
and the Hubble parameter during the inflation. We discuss the axion
fluctuations in some realistic inflation models and find that a significant
amount of the isocurvature fluctuations are naturally produced.

described by quantitative (partly stochastic) models. The models are based on
the behavior of individual pedestrians, which depends on the pedestrian
intentions and on the aspects of movement. The pedestrian intentions concerning
a sequence of destinations are influenced by the demand for certain kinds of
commodities, by the location of stores selling these, and by the expenditures
to get the required commodities. The actual pedestrian movement starts and ends
at special city entry points like parking lots. It is guided by the pedestrian
intentions, but is subject to deceleration processes and avoidance maneuvers
due to obstacles. As a consequence, the pedestrians have to speed up to reach
the next destination well-timed. In addition, the pedestrian behavior is
influenced by unexpected attractions (e.g. street artists). The model for the
behavior of individual pedestrians is an ideal starting point for computer
simulations of pedestrian crowds. Such simulations take into account the
limited capacity of pedestrian ways and places, and allow to determine an
optimal design of pedestrian areas and an optimal arrangement of store
locations. Therefore, they can be applied for town- and traffic-planning. The
model for the behavior of individual pedestrians also allows the derivation of
mathematical equations for pedestrian crowds and for pedestrian groups.
Pedestrian crowds can be described by a stochastic formulation, by a gaskinetic
formulation or by a fluiddynamic formulation. The gaskinetic formulation
(mezoscopic level) can be derived from the stochastic formulation (microscopic
level), and the fluiddynamic formulation (macroscopic level) from the
gaskinetic formulation.

we find that a parameter N contained in the MNBD becomes to be large. Taking
large N limit in the MNBD, we find that the Laguerre-type distribution can be

combine to produce the ``anomaly kick'' to the field configuration of the

characteristic features: the effect is coherent over a large region of space

demonstrate by detailed simulations with longitudinal expansion that the DCC
domain formation is dramatically enhanced by the anomaly kick in spite of its
small absolute magnitude. We examine the behavior of various physical
