IC5249 is almost perfectly edge-on, and it shows no direct sign of warping or

visible at a distance of 3kpc from the disk of the galaxy, and at 6kpc the
surface brightness is ~ 28 mag arcsec^-2. The measured distribution of halo
light is similar to the distribution expected for dark matter. Red dwarfs and
red giants are possible sources of the halo light. If red dwarfs are the
source, and if they are distributed like dark matter, then their density at
galactocentric radius r = 8.5 kpc is (7+/-3) times the the local Galactic
density of halo red dwarfs. Their total contribution to the mass of IC5249

gobular clusters, then their density at r = 8.5 kpc is 1.0 +1.0-0.5 times the
local Galactic density of halo giants, and they provide a gravitationally
insignificant fraction of the mass of the galaxy. Further optical measurements

monitor type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at $z > 0.2$ with the aim of measuring
cosmic deceleration and global curvature. Our collaboration has pursued a basic
understanding of supernovae in the nearby Universe, discovering and observing a
large sample of objects, and developing methods to measure accurate distances
with SN Ia. This paper describes the extension of this program to $z \geq 0.2$,
outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. We have devised
high-throughput filters which provide accurate two-color restframe $B$ and $V$
light curves of SN Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected
luminosity distances in the range $0.25 < z < 0.55$. Sources of systematic
error from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are
investigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral
observations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova, and use the data to
obtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the $z=0.479$ host
galaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SN, yields an
estimate for the matter density of the Universe of $\Omega_M =
-0.2^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$ if $\Omega_\Lambda = 0$. For a spatially flat universe
composed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find $\Omega_M =
0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. We demonstrate that
with a sample of $\sim 30$ objects, we should be able to determine relative
luminosity distances over the range $0 < z< 0.5$ with sufficient precision to
measure $\Omega_M$ with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.2$.

constraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the
cosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the
dynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia
are, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density
(Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve
fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor
eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,
Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0).
With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma
and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and
4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a
``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior
(Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require
Omega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A
Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7
sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including
evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational
lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles
the data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0.

valid for the the linearly clustering regime, and its accuracy is about 10% in

1/1000 of the characteristic non-linear mass M_c. The result is found on the
basis of a careful analysis for a large set of scale-free simulations with 17
million particles. The fitting formula has a weak explicit dependence on the
index n of the initial power spectrum, but can be equally well applied to the
cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological models if the effective index n_{eff} of
the CDM power spectrum at the scale of the halo mass replaces the index n. The
formula agrees with the analytical formula of Mo & White (MW96) for massive
halos with M>M_c, but the MW96 formula significantly underpredicts the
correlation for the less massive halos. The difference between the fitting and
the analytical formulae amounts to a factor => 2 in the correlation amplitude
for M=0.01 M_c. One of the most interesting applications of this fitting
formula would be the clustering of galaxies since the majority of halos hosting
galaxies satisfies M<< M_c.

the optical depth and the average duration of microlensing events,
respectively, while f (0 < f < 1) is a parameter depending on the unknown
stellar luminosity function. The observed mean duration of EAGLE events also
depends on the luminosity function and is (0.01 - 0.4) times the usual duration
of microlensing events, which corresponds to (1 - 30) days. The follow-up
observation using larger telescopes may enable us to determine the impact
parameter and the true duration of the event. If f is determined by another
independent method, we can also determine \tau^{LMC}. Even if f is
undetermined, the detection of EAGLE events strongly suggest that MACHOs are
not due to variable source stars, since EAGLE events are due to the dim
main-sequence stars. Although for the SMC, the event rate is smaller by a
factor of about 7, it is still a substantial number (about 13 f (\tau^{SMC} / 3

and discusses how these may be understood in models of hierarchical
gravitational collapse. The clustering of galaxies at redshift one is much
weaker than at present, and this is consistent with the rate of growth of
structure expected in an open universe. If $\Omega=1$, this observation would
imply that bias increases at high redshift, in conflict with observed $M/L$
values for known high-$z$ clusters. At redshift 3, the population of
Lyman-limit galaxies displays clustering which is of similar amplitude to that
seen today. This is most naturally understood if the Lyman-limit population is
a set of rare recently-formed objects. Knowing both the clustering and the
abundance of these objects, it is possible to deduce empirically the
fluctuation spectrum required on scales which cannot be measured today owing to
gravitational nonlinearities. Of existing physical models for the fluctuation
spectrum, the results are most closely matched by a low-density spatially flat
universe. This conclusion is reinforced by an empirical analysis of CMB
anisotropies, in which the present-day fluctuation spectrum is forced to have
the observed form. Open models are strongly disfavoured, leaving $\Lambda$CDM
as the most successful simple model for structure formation.

with a spectral break at 0.7keV. Two other bright sources are detected
associated with the companion galaxy IC4329, and a likely quasar 14' to the
south-west. We have also established, through optical observations, that three
further X-ray point sources, intriguingly positioned with respect to IC4329A,
are in fact nothing to do with the system. In addition to point source
emission, residual, unresolved emission is detected surrounding the
IC4329A/IC4329 pair, extending for some 200kpc. This emission appears markedly
two-component, comprising of a spectrally hard and smooth component,
circularly-distributed about the central galaxy pair, and a spectrally soft,
more clumpy component, positioned almost entirely to the south-east of IC4329A.
The hard component of the residual emission itself appears two-component, one
component being due to the `wings' of the intensely bright IC4329A source, the
other, apparently due to hot (~1.5keV) gas, likely associated with the galaxy
group of which IC4329A and IC4329 are members. The soft component of the
residual emission may be a larger version of the superwinds seen around some
ultraluminous far-infrared galaxies, or may even represent a `stripped wake' of
intragroup gas. Evidence for shocked gas due to the central IC4329A/IC4329
interaction is also found between the two central galaxies.

full hierarchy of multiple-point density correlation functions, and thus it

actually constant, but it is the ""noisy"" propagation of the wave's edge that

holon fluctuations on the U(1) field B and spinon fluctuations on the SU(2)
field V, the holon field is a fermion and the spinon field is a hard--core
boson. We show that the B field produces a \pi flux phase for holons,
converting them into Dirac--like fermions, while the V field, taking into
account the feedback of holons produces a gap for spinons vanishing in zero
doping limit. The nonlinear sigma-model with a mass term describes the
crossover from short-ranged antiferromagnetic (AF) state in doped samples to
long range AF order in reference compounds. Moreover, we derive a low--energy
effective action in terms of spinons, holons and a self-generated U(1) gauge
field. The gauge fluctuations are not confining due to coupling to holons, but
yield an attractive interaction between spinons and holons leading to a bound
state with electron quantum numbers. The renormalisation effects due to gauge
fluctuations give rise to non--Fermi liquid behaviour for the composite
electron.This formalism provides a new interpretation of the spin gap in

operators depend on the field $\phi({\bf x})$. If the coefficient of the

is an equation on the functional $\Phi[\phi(\cdot)]$. This equation being a
nonlinear analog of the functional Schrodinger equation for the one-field

observe a saturation of the mean width of the trapped states. Also the decay
rates saturate as a function of the coupling strength. The mechanism of the
saturation is studied in detail. In any case, the critical region of
reorganization is enlarged. When the transmission coefficients for the
