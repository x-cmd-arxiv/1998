background fluctuations are essential for comparing current and upcoming data
sets with the large parameter space of viable cosmological models. The most
efficient numerical algorithm for power spectrum calculation, recently
implemented by Seljak and Zaldarriaga, involves integrating sources against
spherical Bessel functions or, in the case of a non-flat universe, analogous
hyperspherical Bessel functions. Evaluation of these special functions usually
dominates the computation time in non-flat spatial geometries. This paper
presents a highly accurate and very fast WKB approximation for computing
hyperspherical Bessel functions which will greatly increase the speed of
microwave background power spectrum computations in open and closed universes.

all other possible causes of significant systematic error in the statistical
parallax determination of RR Lyrae absolute magnitudes, we investigate
systematic errors from two final sources of input data: apparent magnitudes and
extinctions. We find corrections due to each of ~0.05 mag, i.e., ~1/2 the
statistical error. However, these are of opposite sign and so roughly cancel.
The apparent magnitude system that we previously adopted from Layden et al. was
calibrated to the photometry of Clube & Dawe. Using Hipparcos photometry we
show that the Clube & Dawe system is ~0.06 mag too bright. Extinctions were
previously pinned to the HI-based map of Burstein & Heiles. We argue that A_V
should rather be based on new COBE/IRAS dust-emission map of Schlegel,
Finkbeiner & Davis. This change increases the mean A_V by ~0.05 mag. We find
M_V=0.77 +/- 0.13 at [Fe/H]=-1.60 for a pure sample of 147 halo RR Lyraes, or
M_V=0.80 +/- 0.11 at [Fe/H]=-1.71 if we incorporate kinematic information from
716 non-kinematically selected non-RR Lyrae stars from Beers & Sommer-Larsen.
These are 2 and 3 sigma fainter than recent determinations of M_V from main
sequence fitting of clusters using Hipparcos measurements of subdwarfs by Reid
and Gratton et al. Since statistical parallax is being cleared of systematic
errors and since the chance of a >2 sigma statistical fluctuation is <1/20, we
conclude that these brighter determinations may be in error. In the course of
three papers, we have corrected 6 systematic errors whose absolute values total
0.20 mag. Had these, contrary to the expectation of the central limit theorem,
all lined up one way, they could have resolved the conflict in favor of the
brighter determinations. In fact, the net change was only 0.06 mag.

conclusion that Compton scattering, some absorption by a warm absorber,
geometric effects, an asymmetric temperature structure in the accretion region
and an asymmetric density structure of the accretion columnare all important
components needed to fully explain the data. Spectra extracted at phases where
the accretion spot is hidden behind the limb of the WD, but with the accretion

gravity in an expanding background. We take a detailed and formal approach by
deriving the equations describing gravity in (D+1) dimensions using the action
principle of Einstein. We then consider the Newtonian limit of these equations
and finally obtain the necessary fluid equations required to describe structure
formation. These equations are solved for the density perturbation in both the
linearised form and in the spherical top hat model of nonlinear growth. We find
that, when the special case of D=2 is considered, no structures can grow. We
therefore conclude that, within the frame work of Einstein's theory of gravity
in (2+1) dimensions, formation of structures cannot take place. Finally, we
indicate the different possible ways of getting around this difficulty so that
growing structures can be obtained in two dimensional cosmological
gravitational simulations and discuss their implications.

(Hodge-Dirac-)Dualisation of gauge potentials exchanges Noether and topological
charges, equations of motion and Bianchi identities, internal rigid symmetries
and gauge symmetries, local transformations with nonlocal ones and most
exciting particles and waves. We compare the actions of maximally dualised
supergravities (ie with gauge potential forms of lowest possible degree) to the
non-dualised actions coming from 11 (or 10) dimensions by plain dimensional
reduction as well as to other theories with partial dualisations. The effect on
the rigid duality group is a kind of contraction resulting from the elimination
of the unfaithful generators associated to the (inversely) dualised scalar
fields. New gauge symmetries are introduced by these (un)dualisations and it is
clear that a complete picture of duality (F(ull)-duality) should include all
gauge symmetries at the same time as the rigid symmetries and the spacetime
symmetries. We may read off some properties of F-duality on the internal rigid
Dynkin diagram: field content, possible dualisations, increase of the rank
according to the decrease of space dimension... Some recent results are
included to suggest the way towards unification via a universal twisted
self-duality (TS) structure. The analysis of this structure had revealed
several profound differences according to the parity mod 4 of the dimension of
spacetime (to be contrasted with the (Bott) period 8 of spinor properties).

intermediate energy heavy ion collisions is investigated. The mean field in
relativistic transport calculations is derived from microscopic Dirac-Brueckner
(DB) self-energies, taking non-equilibrium effects, in particular the
anisotropy of the local phase space configurations, into account. Thus this
approach goes beyond the local density approximation. A detailed analysis of
various in-plane and out-of-plane flow observables is presented for Au on Au
reactions at incident energies ranging from 250 to 800 A.MeV and the results
are compared to recent measurements of the FOPI collaboration. An overall good
agreement with in-plane flow data and a reasonable description of the
out-of-plane emission is achieved. For these results the intrinsic momentum
dependence of the non-equilibrium mean fields is important. On the other hand,
the local density approximation with the same underlying DB forces as well as a
standard non-linear version of the $\sigma\omega$ model are less successful in
describing the present data. This gives evidence of the applicability of self
energies derived from the DB approach to nuclear matter also far from
saturation and equilibrium.
