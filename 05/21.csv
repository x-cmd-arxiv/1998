young and highly evolved stars. Observations of Planetary Nebulae, the nebulae
surrounding Luminous Blue Variables such as $\eta$ Carinae, Wolf Rayet bubbles,
the circumstellar environment of SN 1987A and Young Stellar Objects all
revealed high velocity outflows with a wide range of shapes. In this paper I
review the current state of our theoretical understanding of these outflows.
  Beginning with Planetary Nebulae considerable progress has been made in
understanding bipolar outflows as the result of stellar winds interacting with
the circumstellar environment. In what has been called the ""Generalized Wind
Blown Bubble"" (GWBB) scenario, a fast tenuous wind from the central star
expands into a ambient medium with an aspherical (toroidal) density
distribution. Inertial gradients due to the gaseous torus quickly lead to an
expanding prolate or bipolar shell of swept-up gas bounded by strong shock
waves. Numerical simulations of the GWBB scenario show a surprisingly rich
variety of gasdynamical behavior, allowing models to recover many of the
observed properties of stellar bipolar outflows including the development of
collimated supersonic jets.
  In this paper we review the physics behind the GWBB scenario in detail and
consider its strengths and weakness. Alternative models involving MHD processes
are also examined. Applications of these models to each of the principle
classes of stellar bipolar outflow (YSO, PNe, LBV, SN87A) are then reviewed.
Outstanding issues in the study of bipolar outflows are considered as are those
questions which arise when the outflows are viewed as a single class of
phenomena occuring across the HR diagram.

Stationary-state three-flavor neutrino distributions are developed in thermally

  Most important, we find, for a region above the gain radius, net heating
rates for MGBT that are as much as ~2 times the corresponding MGFLD rates, and
net cooling rates below the gain radius that are typically ~0.8 times the MGFLD

mean inverse flux factors, which can be as much as 11% and 24%, respectively.
They are greatest at earlier postbounce times for a given progenitor mass and,
for a given postbounce time, greater for greater progenitor mass. We discuss

simulated dark matter halos have a ``universal'' shape so that a given halo can
be characterized by a single free parameter which fixes its mass. In this
paper, we revisit the spherical infall model in the hope of recognizing in
detail the existence and origin of any such universality. A system of particles
is followed from linear perturbation, through first shell crossing, then
through an accretion or infall phase, and finally to virialization. During the
accretion phase, the system relaxes through a combination of phase mixing,
phase space instability, and moderate violent relation. It is driven quickly,
by the flow of mass through its surface, toward self-similar evolution. The
self-similar solution plays its usual role of intermediate attractor and can be
recognized from a virial-type theorem in scaled variables and from our
numerical simulations. The transition to final equilibrium state once infall
has ceased is relatively gentle, an observation which leads to an approximate
form for the distribution function of the final system. The infall phase fixes
the density profile in intermediate regions of the halo to be close to r^{-2}.
We make contact with the standard hierarchical clustering scenario and explain
how modifications of the self-similar infall model might lead to density
profiles in agreement with those found in numerical simulations.

the Galactic bulge, with a measured optical depth in the range 2 - 3 x 10^{-6}.
It has been shown that most of these events are due to bulge stars being lensed
by other bulge stars or by foreground disk stars. Among the stars observed in
the bulge fields, there should also be disk stars located behind the bulge;
here, we consider their effect on the microlensing rates. The optical depth of
background disk stars is much higher than that of typical bulge stars, reaching
10^{-5} at 6 Kpc behind the bulge. Thus, although background disk stars are a
very small fraction of the stars in Baade's window, we find that ~ 5 to 10 % of
the optical depth should be due to disk stars more than 3 kpc behind the bulge.
This fraction is sensitive to the luminosity function of disk stars at large
scale-height, to the magnitude cutoff of the survey, and to the amplification
bias effect causing large numbers of ``blended'' events. We consider also the
effect of a warp and flare in the disk at large distances behind the bulge;
this could increase the optical depth from the background disk to ~ 20 % of the
total. Events on background disk stars should on average be longer than other
events and could be distinguished also by measuring the proper motion or
distance of the stars that have been microlensed. The number of these events
could be an interesting probe to the structure and stellar population of the

X-ray spectrum of the water megamaser galaxy NGC 2639, which is believed to
contain an edge-on viewed accretion disk. The radio observations reveal a
compact ($<$ 0.2 pc) nuclear source with a spectrum that turns over sharply
near 5 GHz. The X-ray spectrum shows emission in excess of a power-law model at
energies greater than 4 keV; we interpret this excess as compact, nuclear, hard
X-ray emission with the lower energies photoelectrically absorbed by an
equivalent hydrogen column of $\simeq$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.
  If we assume that the turnover in the radio spectrum is caused by free-free
absorption and that both the free-free and photoelectric absorptions are
produced by the same gaseous component, the ratio $\int n_{e}^{2} dl/\int n_{H}
dl$ may be determined. If the masing molecular gas is responsible for both
absorptions, the required ionization fraction is $\gtrsim 1.3 \times 10^{-5}$,
which is comparable to the theoretical upper limit derived by Neufeld, Maloney
& Conger (1994) for X-ray heated molecular gas. The two values may be
reconciled if the molecular gas is very dense -- $n_{H_{2}} \gtrsim 10^{9}$
cm$^{-3}$. The measured ionization fraction is also consistent with the idea
that both absorptions occur in a hot ($\sim$ 6,000K), weakly ionized
(ionization fraction a few times 10$^{-2}$) atomic region that may co-exist
with the warm molecular gas. If this is the case, the absorbing gas is $\sim$ 1
pc from the nucleus. If our line of sight passes through more than one phase,
the atomic gas probably dominates the free-free absorption while the molecular
gas may dominate the photoelectric absorption.

used to track the formation and merging of dark matter halos as a function of
redshift. Simple prescriptions, taken directly from semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation, are adopted for cooling, star formation, supernova feedback
and the merging of galaxies within the halos. This scheme enables us to study
the clustering properties of galaxies and to investigate how selection by type,
colour or luminosity influences the results. In this paper, we study properties
of the galaxy distribution at z=0. These include luminosity functions, colours,
correlation functions, pairwise peculiar velocities, cluster M/L ratios and
star formation rates. We focus on two variants of a CDM cosmology: a high-
density model with Gamma=0.21 (TCDM) and a low-density model with Omega=0.3 and
Lambda=0.7 (LCDM). Both are normalized to reproduce the I-band Tully-Fisher
relation near a circular velocity of 220 km/s. Our results depend strongly both
on this normalization and on the prescriptions for star formation and feedback.
Very different assumptions are required to obtain an acceptable model in the
two cases. For TCDM, efficient feedback is required to suppress the growth of
galaxies low-mass field halos. Without it, there are too many galaxies and the
correlation function turns over below 1 Mpc. For LCDM, feedback must be weak,
otherwise too few L* galaxies are produced and the correlation function is too
steep. Given the uncertainties in modelling some of the key physical processes,
we conclude that it is not yet possible to draw conclusions about the values of
cosmological parameters from studies of this kind. Further work on global star
formation and feedback effects is required to narrow the range of possibilities

young (< 0.5 Gyr) main sequence stellar component is present and clustered in
two centrally-located clumps, while older stars form a more extended disk or
halo. The colors of the main sequence require a relatively large extinction of
A_V = 0.47 mag. The mean color of the well-populated red giant branch is
relatively blue, consistent with a moderate metallicity young, or older,
metal-poor stellar population. The red giant branch also has significant width
in color, implying a range of stellar ages and/or metallicities. A small number
of extended asymptotic giant branch stars are found beyond the red giant branch
tip. Near the faint limits of our data is a populous red clump superimposed on
the red giant branch. Efforts to fit self-consistent stellar population models

kpc. Quantitative fits to the stellar population are explored as a means to
constrain the star formation history. The numbers of main sequence and core
helium-burning blue loop stars require that the star formation rate was higher

be obtained for the star formation history over longer time baselines without
better information on stellar metallicities and deeper photometry. The youngest

  Version)","7 pages, uses colacl.sty",,,"CS-TR-98-01","cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  Since the early Sixties and Seventies it has been known that the regular and
context-free languages are characterized by definability in the monadic
second-order theory of certain structures. More recently, these descriptive
characterizations have been used to obtain complexity results for constraint-
and principle-based theories of syntax and to provide a uniform model-theoretic
framework for exploring the relationship between theories expressed in
disparate formal terms. These results have been limited, to an extent, by the
lack of descriptive characterizations of language classes beyond the
context-free. Recently, we have shown that tree-adjoining languages (in a
mildly generalized form) can be characterized by recognition by automata
operating on three-dimensional tree manifolds, a three-dimensional analog of
trees. In this paper, we exploit these automata-theoretic results to obtain a
characterization of the tree-adjoining languages by definability in the monadic
second-order theory of these three-dimensional tree manifolds. This not only
opens the way to extending the tools of model-theoretic syntax to the level of
TALs, but provides a highly flexible mechanism for defining TAGs in terms of
logical constraints.

with decreasing the temperature. On the insulating side of the crossover, the
resistance has been measured as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and
applied voltage for different values of the electron concentration, which was
varied by applying the gate voltage. The activation temperature dependence of
the resistance has been observed with the activation energy close to the mean
energy spacing of electron states within the localization domain. The study of
non-linearity of the current-voltage characteristics provides information on
the distance between the critical hops which govern the resistance of Q1D
conductors in the strong localization (SL) regime. We observe the exponentially
strong negative magnetoresistance; this orbital magnetoresistance is due to the
universal magnetic-field dependence of the localization length in Q1D
conductors. The method of measuring of the single-particle density of states
(DoS) in the SL regime has been suggested. Our data indicate that there is a
minimum of DoS at the Fermi level due to the long-range Coulomb interaction.

A sticker has to overcome a potential barrier both to penetrate the stretched

the corresponding processes are thus local with a friction independent of

history determines the organization of the grains, and thereby the local
relationship between stresses. Our preferred model FPA (Fixed Principle Axes)
assumes that the eigendirections (but not the eigenvalues) of the stress tensor

propagate along a nested set of archlike structures within the medium; the
results are in good quantitative agreement with published experimental data.

overcome through the emission of radiation. Since modes cannot emerge from the

because the black-hole is uncharged, the emission mechanism must be different.
We discuss the physical origin of the effect and obtain a Newtonian estimative.
Then we obtain the appropriate equations in the relativistic case and show that
the field which is radiated away is a combination of gravitational and

Gedankenexperiment accelerating single electrons with photons of suitably low

shown that the kinetic energy in the infinite limit is equal to m_{e} c^{2}/2.
However, the inertial mass of the electron seems enhanced, and it can be
established that this enhancement is described by the relativistic mass effect.
It appears, therefore, that although there exists a singularity in interactions
- the frequency required to accelerate the particle near the limit of c becomes
infinite - the energy of the particle itself approaches a finite limit.
Comparing with calculations of the Lamb-shift by Bethe this result seems to
provide the ultimate justification for the renormalization procedures employed.
