reviewed with particular attention to X-ray transients. The ASM has detected
117 sources. These include 12 recurrent transients and 10 new X-ray sources,
some of which began their outbursts before the launch of RXTE. The majority of
the outburst profiles are strikingly different from the classical form, with
its fast rise and slow decay. Some of the light curves appear quasi-persistent,
which suggests that they are associated with secular changes in the accretion
rate from the donor star rather than with a cyclic instability in the accretion
disk. The nature of the compact object is uncertain in many cases, but there is
a likelihood that the majority of new sources are black hole systems, while the
majority of recurrent transients contain neutron stars. There is a correlation
between the gross shape of the energy spectrum, as seen in the ASM hardness
ratio, HR2 (5-12 keV / 3-5 keV), and the accretion subclass. These data, with
important contributions from SAX, CGRO, and Granat, provide a deeper probe of
the X-ray sky than has been available previously. However, there are important
systematic effects to be investigated before a meaningful evaluation of
transient occurrence rates can be derived.

  publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/306220",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an investigation of the scale-dependence of bias described by the
linear model: $(\delta \rho({\bf x})/\bar{\rho})_{g} = b (\delta
\rho(x)/\bar{\rho})_{m}$, $b$ being the bias parameter, and $\rho({\bf x})_{g}$
and $\rho({\bf x})_{m}$ are the galaxy number density and mass density,
respectively. Using a discrete wavelet decomposition, we show that the behavior
of bias scale-dependence cannot be described by one parameter $b$. In the
linear bias model the scale-dependence should be measured by the $j$-spectra of
wavelet-coefficient-represented bias parameters $\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ and
$b_j^{(n)}$, $n$ being positive integers. Because $\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ with
different $n$ are independent from each other, a systematic analysis of the
$j$-spectra of $\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ and $b_j^{(n)}$ is necessary. We performed a
$j$-spectrum analysis for samples of elliptical and lenticular (EL), and spiral
(SP) galaxies listed in the APM bright galaxy catalog. We found that, for
statistics of two-point correlation functions or DWT power spectrum, the
scale-independence holds within 1 $\sigma$. However, the bias scale-dependence
becomes substantial when phase-sensitive statistics (e.g. $\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$
with $n>2$ or $b_j^{(n)}$) are applied. These results indicate that the bias
scale-dependence has the same origin as the non-Gaussianity of galaxy
distributions. This is generally consistent with the explanation that the bias
scale-dependence originated from non-linear and non-local relationship between
galaxy formation and their environment.

follows that in 1569A the IMF is steep with alpha~2.5 for m**(-alpha)dm IMFs

is contained in low-mass (< 1 M_sun) stars. However, in 1705-1 the IMF is
either flat, with alpha<2$, or it is truncated at a lower mass-limit between 1

clusters. However, the apparent deficiency of low-mass stars in 1705-1 may make
it difficult for this SSC to become a globular cluster. If low-mass stars do

determined both from the absorption lines (V_{abs}) and from the emission lines
(V_{emi}), we find an average difference <V_{abs} - V_{emi}> ~ +100$ km/s. We
find that a similar effect is present in another, deeper redshift survey, the
Durham/Anglo-Australian Telescope faint galaxy redshift survey, while is absent
in surveys at brighter magnitude limits. We have investigated in detail many
possible sources of such a discrepancy, and we can exclude possible zero-point
shifts or calibration problems. We have detected and measured systematic
velocity differences produced by the different templates used in the
cross-correlation. We conclude that such differences can in principle explain
the effect, but in this case the non-trivial implication would be that the
best-fitting template does not necessarily give the best velocity estimate. As
we do not have any a priori reason to select a template different from the
best-fitting one, we did not apply any correction to the ESO Slice Project
velocities. However, as for a small number of galaxies the effect is so large
that it is likely to have a physical explanation, we have also taken into
account the possibility that the discrepancy can be partly real: in this case,
it might help to understand the role of gas outflows in the process of galaxy
evolution. In view of the future large spectroscopic surveys, we stress the
importance of using different templates and making them publicly available, in
order to assess the amplitude of systematic effects, and to allow a direct
comparison of different catalogues.

features of this phenomenon, especially the dependence of SBSL intensity and
stability on experimental parameters, can be explained within a hydrodynamic
approach. More specifically, many important properties can already be derived
from an analysis of bubble wall dynamics. This dynamics is conveniently
described by the Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) equation. In this work we derive
analytical approximations for RP dynamics and subsequent analytical laws for
parameter dependences. These results include (i) an expression for the onset
threshold of SL, (ii) an analytical explanation of the transition from
diffusively unstable to stable equilibria for the bubble ambient radius
(unstable and stable sonoluminescence), and (iii) a detailed understanding of
the resonance structure of the RP equation. It is found that the threshold for
SL emission is shifted to larger bubble radii and larger driving pressures if
surface tension is enlarged, whereas even a considerable change in liquid
viscosity leaves this threshold virtually unaltered. As an enhanced viscosity

certain types of electrical transport, e.g., for current perpendicular to the

Coulomb repulsion stabilizes a regime of charged meron-antimeron vortex soliton
pairs over a region of doping from 0.05 to 0.4 holes per site for intermediate
coupling 3 < U/t <8. This stabilization is mediated through the generation of
``spin-flux'' in the mean-field antiferromagnetic (AFM) background. Holes
cloaked by a meron-vortex in the spin-flux AFM background are charged bosons.
Our static Hartree-Fock calculations provide an upper bound on the energy of a
finite density of charged vortices. This upper bound is lower than the energy
of the corresponding charged stripe configurations. A finite density of charge
carrying vortices is shown to produce a large number of unoccupied electronic
levels in the Mott-Hubbard charge transfer gap. These levels lead to
significant band tailing and a broad mid-infrared band in the optical
absorption spectrum as observed experimentally. At very low doping (below 0.05)
the doping charges create extremely tightly bound meron-antimeron pairs or even
isolated conventional spin-polarons, whereas for very high doping (above 0.4)
the spin background itself becomes unstable to formation of a conventional
Fermi liquid and the spin-flux mean-field is energetically unfavorable. Our
results point to the predominance of a quantum liquid of charged, bosonic,

discussed, with particular reference to the problem of state reconstruction.
The class consists of the subset of Wodkiewicz's operational probability
distributions for which the filter reference state is a squeezed vacuum state.
The fact that the function is analytic means that perfectly precise knowledge
of its values over any small region of phase space provides enough information
to reconstruct the density matrix. If, however, one only has imprecise
knowledge of its values, then the amplification of statistical errors which
occurs when one attempts to carry out the continuation seriously limits the
amount of information which can be extracted. To take account of this fact a
distinction is made between explicate, or experimentally accessible
information, and information which is only present in implicate, experimentally
inaccessible form. It is shown that an explicate description of various aspects
of the system can be found localised on various 2 real dimensional surfaces in
complexified phase space. In particular, the continuation of the function to
the purely imaginary part of complexified phase space provides an explicate
description of the Wigner function.

on providing a quantification of the notions of classicality and
predictability. Our primary tool is the Shannon - Wehrl entropy I. We give a
precise criterion for phase space classicality and argue that in view of this
a) I provides a measure of the degree of deviation from classicality for closed
system b) I - S (S the von Neumann entropy) plays the same role in open systems
We examine particular examples in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Finally,
(this being one of our main motivations) we comment on field classicalisation
on early universe cosmology.
