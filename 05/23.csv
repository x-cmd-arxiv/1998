processes, most notably synchrotron cooling of the non-thermal particles which
produce the radiation. Here we show that a similar power-law dependence occurs,
under certain assumptions, in the context of the blast-wave model and is a

whether or not synchrotron cooling is important, but different degrees of

significant flux of high energy neutrinos, photons and cosmic rays. According
to the prevailing understanding of cosmic string dynamics in an expanding
Universe, the network of long strings loses its energy first into string loops,
which in turn give off most of their energy as gravitational radiation.
However, it has been suggested by Vincent et al. (VHS) that particle emission
may be the dominant energy loss channel for the long string network. In this
case, the predicted flux of high energy particles would be much larger. Here we
calculate the predicted flux of high energy gamma rays, neutrinos and cosmic
ray antiprotons and protons as a function of the scale of symmetry breaking at
which the strings are produced and as a function of the initial energy m_J of
the particle jets which result from the string decay. Assuming the validity of
the VHS scenario, we find that due to the interactions with the cosmic
radiation backgrounds all fluxes but the neutrino flux are suppressed at the
highest energies. This indicates that the observed events above the GZK cutoff
can only be accounted for in this scenario if the primary particle is a
neutrino and the scale of the symmetry breaking is somewhat less than the GUT
scale. The domain of parameter space corresponding to GUT-scale symmetry
breaking is excluded also by the current observations below the GZK cutoff. A
new aspect of this work is the calculation of the spectrum of the tau neutrinos
directly produced in the decay of the X-particles. This significantly increases
the tau neutrino signal at high energies in all cosmic string scenarios.

focussing particularly on the validity of the underlying assumptions. Several
tests of the sum rule within perturbative models are reviewed. Various possible
sources of modifications of the sum rule are examined. With respect to the
current-algebra derivation, the crucial role of the infinite-momentum limit is
pointed out. A derivation is presented that exhibits the infinite-momentum
limit as its last step, opening the prospect of studying its legitimacy within
perturbative models. Adopting the Weinberg-Salam model as a testing ground, it
is shown that a modification due to an anomalous charge-density commutator is
remedied owing to the infinite-momentum limit. This finding is confirmed upon
considering $t$-channel exchange of axial-vector mesons. Several other aspects
of possible sources of modifications are investigated. Evolving the GDH sum
rule to non-zero photon virtualities $Q^2$, it is argued that different
generalizations of the GDH integral, which coincide both at $Q^2=0$ and at
large $Q^2$, may considerably deviate from one another at intermediate $Q^2$.
The limits $Q^2\to0$ and $Q^2\to\infty$ are investigated beyond leading terms.

Abelian and monopole dominance in low energy physics of QCD has been confirmed
for various quantities by recent Monte Carlo simulations of lattice gauge
theory. In order to prove this dominance, we use the reformulation of continuum
Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge as a deformation of a
topological field theory of magnetic monopoles, which was proposed in the
previous article by the author. This reformulation provides an efficient way
for incorporating the magnetic monopole configuration as a topological
non-trivial configuration in the functional integral. We derive a version of
the non-Abelian Stokes theorem and use it to estimate the expectation value of
the Wilson loop. This clearly exhibits the role played by the magnetic monopole
as an origin of the Berry phase in the calculation of the Wilson loop in the
manifestly gauge invariant manner. We show that the string tension derived from
the diagonal (abelian) Wilson loop in the topological field theory (studied in
the previous article) converges to that of the full non-Abelian Wilson loop in
the limit of large Wilson loop. Therefore, within the above reformulation of
QCD, this result (together with the previous result) completes the proof of
quark confinement in QCD based on the criterion of the area law of the full
non-Abelian Wilson loop.

nuclear ideals in tensored *-categories. The motivation for this study came
from attempts to generalize the structure of the category of relations to
handle what might be called ``probabilistic relations''. The compact closed
structure associated with the category of relations does not generalize
directly, instead one obtains nuclear ideals. We introduce the notion of
nuclear ideal to analyze these classes of morphisms. In compact closed
categories, we see that all morphisms are nuclear, and in the category of
Hilbert spaces, the nuclear morphisms are the Hilbert-Schmidt maps.
  We also introduce two new examples of tensored *-categories, in which
integration plays the role of composition. In the first, morphisms are a
special class of distributions, which we call tame distributions. We also
introduce a category of probabilistic relations which was the original
motivating example.
  Finally, we extend the recent work of Joyal, Street and Verity on traced
monoidal categories to this setting by introducing the notion of a trace ideal.
For a given symmetric monoidal category, it is not generally the case that
arbitrary endomorphisms can be assigned a trace. However, we can find ideals in
the category on which a trace can be defined satisfying equations analogous to
those of Joyal, Street and Verity. We establish a close correspondence between
nuclear ideals and trace ideals in a tensored *-category, suggested by the
correspondence between Hilbert-Schmidt operators and trace operators on a
Hilbert space.

(\Delta,\eps). A is called a Weak Bialgebra if the coproduct \Delta is
multiplicative. We do not require \Delta(1) = 1 \otimes 1 nor multiplicativity
of the counit \eps. Instead, we propose a new set of counit axioms, which are
modelled so as to guarantee that \Rep\A becomes a monoidal category with unit
object given by the cyclic A-submodule \E := (A --> \eps) \subset \hat A (\hat
A denoting the dual weak bialgebra). Under these monoidality axioms \E and
\bar\E := (\eps <-- A) become commuting unital subalgebras of \hat A which are
trivial if and only if the counit \eps is multiplicative. We also propose
axioms for an antipode S such that the category \Rep\A becomes rigid. S is
uniquely determined, provided it exists. If a monoidal weak bialgebra A has an
antipode S, then its dual \hat A is monoidal if and only if S is a bialgebra
anti-homomorphism, in which case S is also invertible. In this way we obtain a
definition of weak Hopf algebras which in Appendix A will be shown to be
equivalent to the one given independently by G. B\""ohm and K. Szlach\'anyi.
Special examples are given by the face algebras of T. Hayashi and the

cosemisimple), and then to use our Lifting Theorem 2.1 to prove it for

differential operators is naturally isomorphic to H^1 with coefficients in the
module of functions. The condition that a realization admits a
finite-dimensional invariant subspace of functions seems to act as a kind of
quantization condition on this H^1. It was known that this quantization of
cohomology holds for all realizations on 2-dimensional homogeneous spaces, but
the extent to which quantization of cohomology is true in general was an open
question. The present article presents the first known counter-examples to
quantization of cohomology; it is shown that quantization can fail even if the
Lie algebra is semi-simple, and even if the homogeneous space in question is
compact. A explanation for the quantization phenomenon is given in the case of
semi-simple Lie algebras. It is shown that the set of classes in H^1 that admit
finite-dimensional invariant subspaces is a semigroup that lies inside a
finitely-generated abelian group. In order for this abelian group be a discrete
