covering the pi ster of the Survey area to a limiting magnitude of r~23.1, on
0.4"" pixels, resulting in a 1 Tpixel map. This data base will be automatically
analysed to catalog the photometric and astrometric properties of 10^8 stellar
images, 10^8 galaxies, and 10^6 colour-selected QSO candidates; the galaxy data
will in addition include detailed morphological data. The photometric data are
used to autonomously and homogeneously select objects for the spectroscopic
survey, which will include spectra of 10^6 galaxies, 10^5 QSOs, and 10^5
unusual stars. Although the project was originally motivated by the desire to
study Large Scale Structure, we anticipate that these data will impact
virtually every field of astronomy, from Earth-crossing asteroids to QSOs at
z>6. In particular, the ~12 TByte multi-colour, precision calibrated imaging
archive should be a world resource for many decades of the next century.

occupying only a few percent of the volume. A supernova remnant then evolves
primarily in the interclump medium, and becomes radiative at a radius of about
6 pc, forming a shell that is magnetically supported. When this shell interacts
with the dense clumps, the molecular shock fronts are driven by a considerable
overpressure compared to the pressure in the rest of the remnant. Observations
of the remnants W44 and IC 443 can be understood in this model. Both remnants
are shell sources of radio synchrotron emission, which can be attributed to
relativistic electrons in the cool radiative shell. If ambient cosmic ray
electrons are accelerated by the shock front and by the postshock compression,
the radio fluxes and the flat spectral indices of W44 and IC 443 can be
explained, as well as the high energy gamma ray emission from bremsstrahlung.

are seeing azimuthal asymmetries in the stellar mass distribution. The similar
degree of lopsidedness seen in disks of very different star formation rates
indicates that the lopsidedness in all galactic disks is primarily due to
azimuthal mass asymmetries. Hence, 20% of all disk galaxies (regardless of

itself, the model allows one to describe the evolution of the Eulerian space

on scales larger than the virial radius, of these haloes, and to quantify the
way in which matter flows in and out of Eulerian cells. When the initial
Lagrangian space distribution is white noise Gaussian, the model suggests that
the Inverse Gaussian distribution should provide a reasonably good

discs of Be stars. It is found that these discs may develop warps in their
inner regions, although once the warp amplitude is large enough then the
interaction between the disc and fast radiatively-driven wind will determine
its evolution. The warping is shown to be more important for later than earlier
B stars. Although the interaction of the fast-wind with the disc will limit the
amplitude of the warp, it cannot drive the warp radially outwards, and so the
radial evolution of the warp depends on the dominant advective process within
the disc.
  Typical timescales associated with growing modes are shown to be short, of
the order of days-weeks, although these are not likely to be the timescales
inferred from observations of line-profile variations which are much longer, of

constructed using this algorithm depends on the underlying power spectrum. For
Poisson or white-noise initial power-spectra, the forest has exactly the same
properties as the ensemble of trees described by Sheth (1996) and Sheth &
Pitman (1997). In this case, many ensemble averaged higher order statistics of
the tree distribution can be computed analytically. For Gaussian initial
conditions with more general power-spectra, mean properties of the ensemble
closely resemble the mean properties expected from the excursion set approach.
Various statistical quantities associated with the trees constructed using our

Our results generalize previous 2-chain treatments (valid in dilute reactants
limit) by Doi, de Gennes, and Friedman and O'Shaughnessy, to arbitrary initial
reactive group density $n_0$ and local chemical reactivity $Q$. Simple mean
field (MF) kinetics apply at short times, $k \sim Q$. For high $Q$, a
transition occurs to diffusion-controlled (DC) kinetics with $k \approx
x_t^3/t$ (where $x_t$ is rms monomer displacement in time $t$) leading to a
density decay $n_t \approx n_0 - n_0^2 x_t^3$. If $n_0$ exceeds the chain
overlap threshold, this behavior is followed by a regime where $n_t \approx
1/x_t^3$ during which $k$ has the same power law dependence in time, $k \approx
x_t^3/t$, but possibly different numerical coefficient. For unentangled melts
this gives $n_t \sim t^{-3/4}$ while for entangled cases one or more of the
successive regimes $n_t \sim t^{-3/4}$, $t^{-3/8}$ and $t^{-3/4}$ may be
realized depending on the magnitudes of $Q$ and $n_0$. Kinetics at times longer
than the longest polymer relaxation time $\tau$ are always MF. If a DC regime
has developed before $\tau$ then the long time rate constant is $k \approx
R^3/\tau$ where $R$ is the coil radius. We propose measuring the above kinetics
in a model experiment where radical end groups are generated by photolysis.

diagram, magnetization curves and Curie temperatures are presented and
discussed with help of temperature-dependent quasiparticle densities of state.
In the intermediate valence regime, the hybridization gap plays a major role in
determining the magnetic behaviour. Furthermore, our results indicate that
ferromagnetism in this parameter regime is not induced by an effective
spin-spin interaction between the localized levels mediated by conduction
electrons as it is the case in the Kondo regime. The magnetic ordering is
rather a single band effect within an effective f-band.

r\^{o}le during the course of inflation, and although the dynamics as such is
governed by the potential, the onset and the end of inflation are determined by
the values of both fields jointly. The relative position of the beginning-- and

of potentials that is given in this paper is based on the criterion of whether

This allows us to extract precisely the physical effects of the metric and
antisymmetric tensor, respectively, on the {\it exact} string dynamics in the
SL(2,R) background. The general solution to the proper string size is also
found. We show that the antisymmetric tensor (corresponding to conformal
invariance) generally gives rise to repulsion, and it precisely cancels the
dominant attractive term arising from the metric.
  Both the sinh-Gordon and the cosh-Gordon sectors of the string dynamics in
non-conformally invariant AdS spacetime reduce here to the Liouville equation
(with different signs of the potential), while the original Liouville sector
reduces to the free wave equation. Only the very large classical string size is
affected by the torsion. Medium and small size string behaviours are unchanged.
  We also find illustrative classes of string solutions in the SL(2,R)
background: dynamical closed as well as stationary open spiralling strings, for
which the effect of torsion is somewhat like the effect of rotation in the
metric. Similarly, the string solutions in the 2+1 BH-AdS background with

as a coassociative alternative of weak quasi-Hopf algebras. We follow an
axiomatic approach keeping as close as possible to the ""classical"" theory of
Hopf algebras. The emphasis is put on the new structure related to the presence
of canonical subalgebras A^L and A^R in any weak Hopf algebra A that play the
role of non-commutative numbers in many respects. A theory of integrals is
developed in which we show how the algebraic properties of A, such as the
Frobenius property, or semisimplicity, or innerness of the square of the
antipode, are related to the existence of non-degenerate, normalized, or Haar
integrals. In case of C^*-weak Hopf algebras we prove the existence of a unique
Haar measure h in A and of a canonical grouplike element g in A implementing
the square of the antipode and factorizing into left and right algebra
elements. Further discussion of the C^*-case will be presented in Part II.

dynamical systems with discrete time. The dynamics is governed by the
competition between a local piece-wise affine bistable mapping and any
couplings given by the convolution with a function of bounded variation. We
prove the existence of travelling wave interfaces, namely fronts, and the
uniqueness of the corresponding selected velocity and shape. This selected
velocity is shown to be the propagating velocity for any interface, to depend
continuously on the couplings and to increase with the symmetry parameter of
the local nonlinearity. We apply the results to several examples including
discrete and continuous couplings, and the planar fronts' dynamics in
multi-dimensional Coupled Map Lattices. We eventually emphasize on the
extension to other kinds of fronts and to a more general class of bistable
extended mappings for which the couplings are allowed to be nonlinear and the
local map to be smooth.

measurement of the interaction energy between one atom and a high-finesse
optical cavity, during individual transit events of $\sim 250$ $\mu$s duration.
Measurements over a wide range of atom-cavity detunings reveal the transition
from resonant to dispersive coupling, via the transfer of atom-induced signals
from the amplitude to the phase of light transmitted through the cavity. By
suppressing all sources of excess technical noise, we approach a measurement
regime in which the broadband photocurrent may be interpreted as a classical
record of conditional quantum evolution in the sense of recently developed
quantum trajectory theories.

low noise. This is not regarded as evidence of `real' squeezing because
squeezed light cannot be extracted from the loop using a linear beam splitter.
Here I show that illuminating an atom (which is a nonlinear optical element)
with `in-loop' squeezed light causes line-narrowing of one quadrature of the
atom's fluorescence. This has long been regarded as an effect which can only be
produced by squeezing. Experiments on atoms using in-loop squeezing should be
much easier than those with conventional sources of squeezed light.

  interpretation of recently published results","Annales Fond.Broglie 21 (1996) 455-480",,,"quant-ph chao-dyn nlin.CD",,"  The qualitatively new concept of dynamic complexity in quantum mechanics is
based on a new paradigm appearing within a nonperturbational analysis of the
Schroedinger equation for a generic Hamiltonian system. The unreduced analysis
explicitly provides the complete, consistent solution as a set of many
incompatible components ('realisations') which should permanently and
probabilistically replace one another, since each of them is 'complete' in the
ordinary sense. This discovery leads to the universally applicable concept of
dynamic complexity and self-consistent, realistic resolution of the stagnating
problems of quantum chaos, quantum measurement, indeterminacy and wave
reduction. The peculiar, 'mysterious' character of quantum behaviour itself is
seen now as a result of a dynamically complex, intrinsically multivalued
behaviour of interacting fields at the corresponding lowest levels of the (now
completely causal) structure of reality. Incorporating the results of the
canonical theories as an over-simplified limiting case, this new approach
urgently needs support, since its causality and completeness are directly
extendible to arbitrary cases of complex behaviour of real systems, in sharp
contrast to the dominating inefficient empiricism of 'computer experimentation'
with primitive mechanistic (i. e. dynamically single-valued) 'models' of the
irreducibly multivalued reality.
