65. Only the southwest lobe is polarized. The polarizatrion asymmetry between
the two lobes suggests that the triple source axis is slightly out of the

Abell 2246 (z=0.225) which provide far-ultraviolet (FUV) images of some of the

field of view of Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT) observations of the quasar
HS1700+64, which accumulated over 7100 seconds of UIT FUV exposure time during
the Astro-2 mission in March 1995. For objects found on both the FUV and
ground-based V-band images, we obtain FUV (l ~ 1520 A) photometry and V-band
photometry, as well as mid-UV (l ~ 2490 A) photometry from UIT Astro-1
observations and ground-based I-band photometry. We find five objects in the
images which are probably galaxies at the distance of Abell 2246, with FUV
magnitudes (m(FUV)) between 18.6 and 19.6, and V magnitudes between 18.4 and
19.6. We find that their absolute FUV fluxes and colors imply strongly that
they are luminous galaxies with significant current star formation, as well as
some relatively recent, but not current, (> 400 Myr ago) star formation. We
interpret the colors of these five objects by comparing them with local
objects, redshift-corrected template spectra and stellar population models,
finding that they are plausibly matched by 10-Gyr-old population models with
decaying star formation, with decay time constants in the range 3 Gyr < t < 5
Gyr, with an additional color component from a single burst of moderate ( ~
400-500 Myr) age. From derived FUV luminosities we compute current star
formation rates. We compare the UV properties of Abell 2246 with those of the
Coma cluster, finding that Abell 2246 has significantly more recent star
formation, consistent with the Butcher-Oemler phenomenon.

of bulge dominated disk galaxies, such as S0s and disky ellipticals. The aim of
this paper is to examine whether spirals, S0s, and disky elllipticals all can
be incorporated in one simple galaxy formation scenario. We investigate an
inside-out formation scenario in which the inner, low angular momentum material
is assumed to form the bulge. Stability arguments are used to suggest that this
bulge formation is a self-regulating process in which the bulge grows until it
is massive enough to allow the remaining gas to form a stable disk component.
We search for the parameters and physical processes that determine the
disk-to-bulge ratio, and therewith explain to a large extent the origin of the
Hubble sequence. The spread in halo angular momenta coupled with a spread in
the formation redshifts can explain the observed spread in disk properties and
disk-to-bulge ratios from spirals to S0s. Disky ellipticals, however, are too
compact to be incorporated. Upon introducing a galaxy formation efficiency that
depends on redshift, as suggested by the small amount of scatter in the
observed Tully-Fisher relation, this scenario naturally predicts a
density-morphology relation, the amplitude of which depends on the baryon
fraction of the Universe.

  Letters",,"10.1086/306457",,"astro-ph",,"  The persistent increases in spin-down rate offsets seen to accompany glitches
in the Crab and other pulsars suggest increases in the spin-down torque. We
interpret these offsets as due to starquakes occurring as the star spins down
and the rigid crust becomes less oblate. We study the evolution of strain in
the crust, the initiation of starquakes, and possible consequences for magnetic
field and torque evolution. Crust cracking occurs as equatorial material shears
under the compressive forces arising from the star's decreasing circumference,
and matter moves to higher latitudes along a fault inclined to the equator. A
starquake is most likely to originate near one of the two points on the
rotational equator farthest from the magnetic poles. The material breaks along
a fault approximately aligned with the magnetic poles. We suggest that the
observed offsets come about when a starquake perturbs the star's mass
distribution, producing a misalignment of the angular momentum and spin axes.
Subsequently, damped precession to a new rotational state increases the angle
alpha between the rotation and magnetic axes. The resulting increase in
external torque appears as a permanent increase in the spin-down rate. Repeated
starquakes would continue to increase alpha, making the pulsar more of an
orthogonal rotator.

the simulated alpha_ox - Lo relation can exhibit various `apparent' properties,
including an increasing alpha_ox with Lo, similar to what has been found from
observations. The determining factor for this behavior turns out to be the
relative strength of the dispersions of the luminosities, i.e. their deviations
from the mean spectral energy distribution at the optical and X-ray bands, such
that a dispersion larger for the optical luminosity than for the X-ray
luminosity tends to result in an apparent correlation. We suggest that the
observed alpha_ox - Lo correlation can be attributed, at least to some extent,
to such an effect, and is thus not an underlying physical property. The
consequences of taking into account the luminosity dispersions in an analysis

drops. In {\em diffusive} mesoscopic junctions the change is even more drastic,

  The effect is a manifestation of nonlocal relation between the supercurrent

introduced. These machines produce two imperfect copies of a single state that
emerge from two distinct Heisenberg channels. The tradeoff between the quality
of these copies is shown to result from a complementarity akin to Heisenberg
uncertainty principle. A no-cloning inequality is derived for isotropic
cloners: if $\pi_a$ and $\pi_b$ are the depolarizing fractions associated with
the two copies, the domain in $(\sqrt{\pi_a},\sqrt{\pi_b})$-space located
inside a particular ellipse representing close-to-perfect cloning is forbidden.
More generally, a no-cloning uncertainty relation is discussed, quantifying the
impossibility of copying imposed by quantum mechanics. Finally, an asymmetric
Pauli cloning machine is defined that makes two approximate copies of a quantum
bit, while the input-to-output operation underlying each copy is a (distinct)
Pauli channel. The class of symmetric Pauli cloning machines is shown to
provide an upper bound on the quantum capacity of the Pauli channel of
probabilities $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$.

$N$ coupled oscillators are obtained from Poisson realizations of
Heisenberg--Weyl, harmonic oscillator and $sl(2,\R)$ coalgebras. Various
completely integrable deformations of such systems are constructed by
considering quantum deformations of these algebras. Explicit expressions for
all the deformed Hamiltonians and constants of motion are given, and the
long-range nature of the interactions is shown to be linked to the underlying
coalgebra structure. The relationship between oscillator systems induced from
the $sl(2,\R)$ coalgebra and angular momentum chains is presented, and a
non-standard integrable deformation of the hyperbolic Gaudin system is
obtained.
