interaction with a neighbouring protostar whilst a large fraction of its mass
is still in a massive, extended disc. If protostars are formed individually
within a cluster before falling together and interacting, there should be no
preferred orientation for such interactions. As star formation within clusters
is believed to be coeval, it is probable that during interactions, both
protostars possess massive, extended discs.
  We have used an SPH code to carry out a series of simulations of non-colpanar
disc-disc interactions. We find that non-coplanar interactions trigger
gravitational instabilities in the discs, which may then fragment to form new
companions to the existing stars. (This is different from coplanar
interactions, in which most of the new companion stars form after material in
the discs has been swept up into a shock layer, and this then fragments.) The
original stars may also capture each other, leading to the formation of a
small-N cluster. If every star undergoes a randomly oriented disc-disc
interaction, then the outcome will be the birth of many new stars.
Approximately two-thirds of the stars will end up in multiple systems.

latter is used to identify Wolf-Rayet stars found by ground-based spectroscopy
and to locate nebular HeII emission. Most of the HeII emission is associated
with the NW stellar cluster, displaced from the surrounding shell-like [OIII]

stars and/or compact nebular HeII emission as well as residual diffuse
emission. New evolutionary tracks and synthesis models at the appropriate
metallicity predict a mass limit M_WR ~90 Msun for WR stars to become WN and
WC/WO. The observed equivalent widths of the WR lines are in good agreement
with an instantaneous burst model with a Salpeter IMF extending up to M_up ~
120-150 Msun. Our model is also able to fully reproduce the observed equivalent
widths of nebular HeII emission due to the presence of WC/WO stars. This
finding together with the spatial distribution of nebular HeII further supports
the hypothesis that WR stars are responsible for nebular HeII emission in
extra-galactic HII regions. Finally we discuss the implications on stellar mass
loss, chemical yields, final stellar masses, and the ionizing flux of starburst
galaxies at very low metallicities.

arcmin large FRII-type radio galaxy WNB 0313+683. It has a redshift of 0.0901
+/- 0.0002 and a projected linear size of 2.0 Mpc. Using multi-frequency radio
data from the WENSS and NVSS surveys, the VLA, the WSRT and the 100m Effelsberg
telescope, we have derived the age of the source (1.4 +/- 0.1 x 10^8 yrs) and
the particle densities around the two radio lobes (>1.6 x 10^(-6) per cubic cm
for the southern lobe and >5.8 x 10^(-7) per cubic cm for the northern). From
optical spectroscopy we find that the H$\alpha$ emission line has a broad
component, and that the extinction is large (with colour index E(B-V) = 0.98
+/- 0.10 mag), but is probably mostly galactic in origin (b= +9.8 degrees).
Further, the radio core has an inverted spectrum with a spectral index of +0.42
+/- 0.03, suggesting a very compact structure. At 10.5 GHz, it contributes 25%
of the total flux density of the source, which is extremely high for radio
galaxies. WNB 0313+683 has a very large optical emission line flux with respect
to its estimated jet power, when compared with the correlation between these
two properties found by Rawlings & Saunders (1991). We argue that this,
together with the relatively high radio power and the inverted radio spectrum
of the radio core, is suggestive of a new phase of radio activity in this
source.

which solve the Poisson equation both provides an easily parallelized n-body

quickly and provides the highest computational advantage if the lowest-order
potential-density pair in the basis looks like the unperturbed galaxy or
stellar system. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of such basis in the
literature which limits this advantage. This paper presents an algorithm for
deriving these bases to match a wide variety of galaxy models. The method is
based on efficient numerical solution of the Sturm-Liouville equation and can
be used for any geometry with a separable Laplacian. Two cases are described in
detail. First for the spherical case, the lowest order basis function pair may
be chosen to be exactly that of the underlying model. The profile may be cuspy
or have a core and truncated or of infinite extent. Secondly, the method yields
a three-dimensional cylindrical basis appropriate for studying galaxian disks.
In this case, the vertical and radial bases are coupled; the lowest order
radial part of the basis function can be chosen to match the underlying profile
only in the disk plane. Practically, this basis is still a very good match to
the overall disk profile and converges in a small number of terms.

components are constant over a period of 10 hours to within about 0.05 mag. In
the final 5 hours there is some evidence (not conclusive) for variation of

about 0.3 mag. Components C and D were fainter than component A by about 1.3

component A. Using the PC chip, we measure the relative distances of the four

  details of the prospect of using SIM for follow-up observations of
  photometrically detected microlensing events, and (iii) a more elaborate
  discussion of the effects of blending. The abstract is abridged",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Due to dramatic improvements in the precision of astrometric measurements,
the observation of light centroid shifts in observed stars due to intervening
massive compact objects (`astrometric microlensing') will become possible in
the near future. Upcoming space missions, such as SIM and GAIA, will provide
measurements with an accuracy of 4 to 60 micro-arcsec depending on the
magnitude of the observed stars, and an accuracy of about 1 micro-arcsec is
expected to be achieved in the more distant future. There are two different
ways in which astrometric microlensing signals can be used to infer
information: one possibility is to perform astrometric follow-up observations
on photometrically detected microlensing events, and the other is to perform a
survey based on astrometric observations alone. The probability that the disk
stars introduce a centroid shift larger than a threshold at a given time for a
given source in the Galactic bulge towards Baade's window reaches 100% for a
threshold of 0.7 micro-arcsec, while this probability is 2% for a threshold of
5 micro-arcsec. However, this centroid shift does not vary much during a the
timescale of a typical photometric microlensing event. So astrometric
follow-ups (e.g. with SIM) are not expected to be disturbed by the statistical
astrometric microlensing due to disk stars, so that it is possible to infer
additional information about the nature of the lens that caused the photometric
event. For the upcoming mission GAIA, we expect ~1000 of the observed stars to
show a detectable astrometric microlensing signal within its 5 year lifetime.
These events can be used to determine accurate masses of the lenses, and to
derive the mass and the scale parameters (length and height) of the Galactic
disk.

populations in the central region of the cluster. Forty eight blue straggler
stars are identified and are found to be strongly concentrated towards the
center. The specific frequency of blue stragglers, F_BSS\equiv
N(BSS)/N(V<V_HB+2), is 0.25\pm 0.05 in the inner region of M30 (r<20''),
significantly higher than the frequency found in other clusters. The shape of
M30's BSS luminosity function resembles the prediction of the collisional
formation model and is inconsistent with the binary merger model, of Bailyn and
Pinsonneault. An unusually blue star (B=18.6,B-V=-0.97), possibly a cataclysmic
variable based on its color, is found about 1.2'' from the center. Bright RG
stars appear to be depleted by a factor of 2--3 in the inner r<10'' relative to
fainter giants, subgiants, and MSTO stars (95% significance). We confirm that
there is a radial gradient in the color of the cluster light, going from
B-V=0.82 at r=1' to B-V=0.45 in the central 10''. The central depletion of the
bright RG is responsible for about half of the observed color gradient; the
rest of the gradient is caused by the relative underabundance of faint red MS
stars near the center (presumably a result of mass segregation). The luminosity
function of M30's evolved stars does not match the luminosity function shape
derived from standard stellar evolutionary models: the ratio of the number of
bright giants to the number of turnoff stars in the cluster is 30% higher than
predicted by the model (3.8\sigma effect), roughly independent of RG brightness
over the range M_V=-2 to +2. (abridged)

from studies of field stars, most of the detected X-ray sources are binaries,
preferably with short periods and eccentric orbits. In addition, several of the

diagram. This is most likely due to rather complex evolutionary histories,
involving the presence of mass transfer or large mass losses. The X-ray
luminosity of the sources does not scale with the stellar parameters in an
obvious way. In particular, no relationship is found between coronal emission
and stellar magnitude or binary period. The Ca II K chromospheric flux from
most of the counterparts is in excess to that of single stars in the cluster by
one order of magnitude. The X-ray luminosity of the sources in the old M 67 is

have been observed. If the QPOs are produced because of inhomogeneities in the
accretion disk at the magnetospheric boundary, the low frequency of the QPOs
indicate a large magnetosphere for this pulsar. Both the Keplerian frequency
model and the beat frequency model are applicable for production of QPOs in
this source. The QPOs and regular pulsations are found to be stronger at higher
energy which favours the beat frequency model. The magnetic field of the pulsar
is calculated as a function of its distance. The energy spectrum is found to be
very hard, consisting of two components, a cut-off power law and an iron
fluorescence line.

waves at the boundaries of the large-scale structures as sheets, filaments, and
clusters of galaxies. If magnetic fields are present at these shocks, particle
acceleration should take place, and could contribute to the observed cosmic
rays of high energies. When the radio plasma of an old invisible radio lobe is
dragged into such a shock wave, the relativistic electron population will be
reaccelerated and the plasma becomes radio-luminous again. Such tracers of the
accretion shock waves are observed at the boundaries of some clusters of
galaxies: the so-called cluster radio relics, which are large regions of
diffuse radio emission, without any parent galaxy nearby. The observed
properties of the cluster radio relics are naturally explained by accretion
shock waves. Radio relics therefore give the first evidence for the existence
of accretion shocks of the large-scale structure formation and they allow
investigations of the shock properties.

Glass, a phase with quasi-long-range translational order and competing
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions. (2) The
transition is the melting of this Wigner Glass, disorder being the agent
allowing the transition to be second order. (3) Within the Wigner Glass phase,
there are at least two, distinct magnetic ground-states, a ferromagnetic state
at very low electron density and a spin-liquid state with a spin pseudo-gap at
higher densities. (4) The metallic side of the transition is a non-Fermi
liquid. These conclusions are encapsulated in Figure 1 which presents the
proposed phase diagram as a function of disorder strength and density; we also
suggest experimental signatures of the various phases and transitions.

observed in some submonolayer experiments on spreading polymer films, imply
that the collective diffusion coefficient $D_C(\theta)$ must be an increasing
function of the surface coverage $\theta$ for small and intermediate coverages.
Through simulations of a discrete model of interacting chainlike molecules, we
demonstrate that this is caused by an entropy-induced repulsive interaction.
Excellent agreement is found between experimental and numerically obtained
density profiles in this case, demonstrating that steep submonolayer film edges
naturally arise due to the diffusive properties of chainlike molecules. When
the entropic repulsion dominates over interchain attractions, $D_C(\theta)$
first increases as a function of $\theta$ but then eventually approaches zero
for $\theta \to 1$. The maximum value of $D_C(\theta)$ decreases for increasing
attractive interactions, leading to density profiles that are in between
spherical cap and Gaussian shapes. We also develop an analytic mean field
approach to explain the diffusive behavior of chainlike molecules. The
thermodynamic factor in $D_C(\theta)$ is evaluated using effective free energy
arguments, and the chain mobility is calculated numerically using the recently
developed dynamic mean field theory. Good agreement is obtained between theory
and simulations.

a full 3D, nonlinear evolution code. These data sets mimic the late stages of
coalescing black holes. We compare various aspects of the evolution of
axisymmetric initial data sets, obtained with this 3D code, to results obtained
from a well established axisymmetric code. In both codes we examine and compare
the behavior of metric functions, apparent horizon properties, and waveforms,
and show that these dynamic black holes can be accurately evolved in 3D. In
particular we show that with present computational resources and techniques,
the process of excitation and ringdown of the black hole can be evolved, and
one can now extract accurately the gravitational waves emitted from the 3D
Cartesian metric functions, even when they carry away only a small fraction
($<< 1%$) of the rest mass energy of the system. Waveforms for both the
$\ell=2$ and the much more difficult $\ell=4$ and $\ell=6$ modes are computed
and compared with axisymmetric calculations. In addition to exploring the
physics of distorted black hole data sets, and showing the extent to which the
waves can be accurately extracted, these results also provide important
testbeds for all fully nonlinear numerical codes designed to evolve black hole
spacetimes in 3D, whether they use singularity avoiding slicings, apparent
horizon boundary conditions, or other evolution methods.

no-boundary initial condition with the definability of the quantum measure
reduces reduces to the normalizability and unitary evolution of the no-boundary

within a Taub minisuperspace model with spatial topology S^3, and the spacetime
topology R^2 x T^2 within a Bianchi type I minisuperspace model with spatial
topology T^3. In each case there exists exactly one complex saddle point (or
combination of saddle points) that yields a wave function compatible with
normalizability and unitary evolution. The existence of such saddle points
tends to bear out the suggestion that the unimodular theory is less divergent
than traditional Einstein gravity. In the Bianchi type I case, the
distinguished complex solution is approximately real and Lorentzian at late
times, and appears to describe an explosive expansion from zero size at T=0.
(In the Taub cases, in contrast, the only complex solution with nearly
Lorentzian late-time behavior yields a wave function that is normalizable but
evolves nonunitarily, with the total probability increasing exponentially in
the unimodular ""time"" in a manner that suggests a continuous creation of new
universes at zero volume.) The issue of the stability of these results upon the
