nearly Keplerian disks such as protoplanetary disks. Resonant relaxation does
not affect the semimajor axes of the particles, but enhances relaxation of
particle eccentricities and inclinations. The equilibrium state after resonant
relaxation is a Rayleigh distribution, with the mean-square eccentricity and
inclination inversely proportional to mass. The rate of resonant relaxation
depends strongly on the precession rate of the disk. If the precession due to
the disk's self-gravity is small compared to the total precession, then the
relaxation is concentrated near the secular resonance between each pair of
interacting bodies; on the other hand if the precession rate is dominated by
the disk's self-gravity then relaxation occurs through coupling to the
large-scale low-frequency m=1 normal modes of the disk. Depending on the disk
properties, resonant relaxation may be either stronger or weaker than the usual
non-resonant relaxation.

global change in the SED with quasar luminosity, in that more luminous quasars
must have characteristically softer ionizing continua. This is completely
consistent with observations that show correlations between L_uv, alpha_ox,
alpha_uvx, line ratios and EWs. However, to explain the complete lack of a
correlation in the EW(NV)--L_uv diagram we propose that the more luminous
quasars have characteristically larger gas metallicities (Z). As a secondary
element, nitrogen's rapidly increasing abundance with increasing Z compensates
for the losses in EW(NV) emitted by gas illuminated by softer continua in
higher luminosity quasars. A characteristic relationship between Z and L has an
impact on the EW--L_uv relations for other lines as well. For a fixed SED, an
increasing gas metallicity reduces the EW of the stronger metal lines (the gas
cools) and that of Ly_alpha and especially HeII (because of the increasing
metal opacity), while the weaker lines (e.g., CIII] 1909) generally respond
positively. The interplay between the effects of a changing SED and Z with L
results in the observed luminosity dependent spectral variations. All of the

sensitive to spatial resolution in numerical simulations and has previously
been overestimated. The new result, which predicts a distribution with a median
b of around 20-22 km/s at z=3, is substantially below that observed. We examine
a number of possible causes of this discrepancy and argue that it is unlikely

agrees quite well with that observed, and the high-end tail is naturally
produced by the filamentary nature of gravitational collapse in these models.

also examine the physical nature of the gas which is responsible for the

5--9 WNL stars and/or compact nebular HeII emission, as well as residual
diffuse emission. Only one of them is outside the NW cluster. We have
calculated evolutionary tracks for massive stars and synthesis models at the

equivalent widths of nebular HeII emission due to the presence of WC/WO stars.
This quantitative agreement and the spatial correlation of nebular HeII with
the stellar cluster and the position of WR stars shown from the ground-based
spectra further supports the hypothesis that WR stars are responsible for
nebular HeII emission in extra-galactic HII regions. (Abridged abstract)

star clusters (i.e. globular clusters). The dynamical processes included in
this study are restricted to gravitational (point-mass) interactions, the
steady tidal field of a galaxy, and instantaneous mass loss resulting from
stellar evolution. With evolution driven by these mechanisms, it is known that
clusters fall roughly into two broad classes: those that dissipate promptly in
the tidal field, as a result of mass loss, and those that survive long enough
for their evolution to become dominated by two-body relaxation.
  The time scales of the processes we consider scale in different ways with the
number of stars in the simulation, and the main aim of the paper is to suggest
how the scaling of a simulation should be done so that the results are
representative of the evolution of a `real' cluster. We investigate three
different ways of scaling time. One of these is appropriate to the first type
of cluster, i.e. those that dissipate rapidly, and similarly a second scaling
is appropriate only to the second (relaxation-dominated) type. We also develop
a hybrid scaling which is a satisfactory compromise for both types of cluster.
Finally we present evidence that the widely used Fokker-Planck method produces
models which are in good agreement with N-body models of those clusters which
are relaxation dominated, at least for N-body models with several thousand
particles, but that the Fokker-Planck models evolve too fast for clusters which
dissipate promptly.

result from reconnection of flux tubes rising from the accretion disk by the

examples, GX339-4, we identify the geometry and the physical conditions
characterizing each of these states. We find that, in the Soft state, flaring
occurs at small scale heights above the accretion disk. The soft thermal-like
spectrum is the result of heating and consequent re-radiation of the hard
X-rays produced by such flares. The hard tail is produced by Comptonization of
the soft field radiation. Conversely, the hard state is the result of flares
triggered high above the underlying accretion disk which produce X-rays via
Comptonization of either internal synchrotron radiation or soft disk photons.
The spectral characteristics of the different states are naturally accounted
for by the choice of geometry: when flares are triggered high above the disk
the system is photon-starved, hence the hard Comptonized spectrum of the hard
state. Intense flaring close to the disk greatly enhances the soft-photon field
with the result that the spectrum softens. We interpret the two states as being
related to two different phases of magnetic energy dissipation. In the Soft
state, Parker instability in the disk favours the emergence of large numbers of
relatively low magnetic field flux tubes. In the hard state, only intense
magnetic fields become buoyant. The model can also qualitatively account for
the observed short timescale variability and the characteristics of the X-ray
reflected component of the hard state.

by affecting the vacuum, and inertia in turn, through a0; or, the same vacuum
effect enters both MOND (through a0) and cosmology (e.g. through a cosmological
constant). For the vacuum to serve as substratum for inertia a body must be
able to read in it its non-inertial motion; this indeed it can, by detecting
Unruh-type radiation. A manifestation of the vacuum is also seen, even by
inertial observers, in a non-trivial universe (marked, e.g., by curvature or
expansion). A non-inertial observer in a nontrivial universe will see the
combined effect. An observer on a constant-acceleration (a) trajectory in a de
Sitter universe with cosmological constant L sees Unruh radiation of

have circumstellar discs which are comparable in size to the separations
between the stars. Interactions between neighbouring stars and discs are
therefore likely to play a key role in determining disc lifetimes, stellar
masses, and the separations and eccentricities of binary orbits. Such
interactions may also cause fragmentation of the discs, thereby triggering the
formation of additional stars.
  We have carried out a series of simulations of disc-star interactions using
an SPH code which treats self-gravity, hydrodynamic and viscous forces. We find
that interactions between discs and stars provide a mechanism for removing
energy from, or adding energy to, the orbits of the stars, and for truncating
the discs. However, capture during such encounters is unlikely to be an
important binary formation mechanism.
  A more significant consequence of such encounters is that they can trigger
fragmentation of the disc, via tidally and compressionally induced
gravitational instabilities, leading to the formation of additional stars. When
the disc-spins and stellar orbits are randomly oriented, encounters lead to the
formation of new companions to the original star in 20% of encounters. If most
encounters are prograde and coplanar, as suggested by simulations of
dynamically-triggered star formation, then new companions are formed in

as the fractal geometry to the global cloud cover pattern concomitant with
inverse power law form for power spectra of temporal fluctuations on all
space-time scales ranging from turbulence(centimeters-seconds) to
climate(kilometers-years). Long-range spatiotemporal correlations are
ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature and are identified as signatures of
self-organized criticality. Standard models in meteorological theory cannot
explain satisfactorily the observed self-organized criticality in atmospheric
flows. Mathematical models for simulation and prediction of atmospheric flows
are nonlinear and do not possess analytical solutions. Finite precision
computer realizations of nonlinear models give unrealistic solutions because of
deterministic chaos, a direct consequence of round-off error growth in
iterative numerical computations. Recent studies show that round-off error
doubles on an average for each iteration of iterative computations. Round-off
error propagates to the main stream computation and gives unrealistic solutions
in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models which incorporate
thousands of iterative computations in long-term numerical integration schemes.
An alternative non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric
flows described in this paper predicts the observed self-organized criticality
as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics.

learn language and to build programs that can understand language. Using a
representation that makes the relevant features explicit is a prerequisite for
successful learning and understanding. Therefore, I chose to represent
relations between individual words explicitly in my model. Lexical attraction
is defined as the likelihood of such relations. I introduce a new class of
probabilistic language models named lexical attraction models which can
represent long distance relations between words and I formalize this new class
of models using information theory.
  Within the framework of lexical attraction, I developed an unsupervised
language acquisition program that learns to identify linguistic relations in a
given sentence. The only explicitly represented linguistic knowledge in the
program is lexical attraction. There is no initial grammar or lexicon built in
and the only input is raw text. Learning and processing are interdigitated. The
processor uses the regularities detected by the learner to impose structure on
the input. This structure enables the learner to detect higher level
regularities. Using this bootstrapping procedure, the program was trained on
100 million words of Associated Press material and was able to achieve 60%
precision and 50% recall in finding relations between content-words. Using
knowledge of lexical attraction, the program can identify the correct relations
in syntactically ambiguous sentences such as ``I saw the Statue of Liberty

related with this are the timing and sequencing of the states of a time series.
The frequency and characteristics of time series can be investigated by
Monte-Carlo simulations. If one is interested in cross-sectional data connected
with the stochastic process under consideration, one needs to know the temporal
evolution of the distribution of states. This can be obtained by simulation of
the associated master equation. Some new formulas allow the determination of
path-related (i.e. longitudinal) quantities like the occurence probability, the
occurence time distribution, or the effective cumulative life-time distribution
of a certain sequencing of states (path). These can be efficiently evaluated
with a recently developed simulation tool (EPIS). The effective cumulative
life-time distribution facilitates the formulation of a hidden state concept of
behavioral changes which allows an interpretation of the respective
time-dependence of hazard rates. Hidden states represent states which are
either not phenomenological distinguishable from other states, not externally

evolution of the dissipative state in such system is a complex process. It
starts as an avalanche process characterized by nucleation, growth, and thermal
destruction of such dissipative elements as continuous conducting chains of
particles as well as electroconvective vortices. A power-law distribution of
avalanche sizes and durations, observed at this stage of the evolution,
indicates that the system is in a self-organized critical state. A sharp
transition into an avalanche-free state with a stable pattern of conducting
chains is observed when the power dissipated in the fluid reaches its maximum.
We propose a simple evolution model which obeys the maximum power condition and

junctions (SJJs) as a function of an applied magnetic field parallel to the
junction planes is studied theoretically and experimentally for different
junction lengths and coupling parameters. It is shown that the Ic(H) patterns
of long SJJs are very complicated without periodicity in H. This is due to
interaction between junctions in the stack. This, in turn, gives rise to the
existence of multiple quasi-equilibrium Josephson fluxon modes and submodes
which are different with respect to the symmetry of the phase and the fluxon
sequence in SJJs. The critical current of long SJJs is multiple valued and is
governed by switching between energetically close fluxon modes/submodes. Due to
this, the probability distribution of the critical current may become wide and
may consist of multiple maxima each representing a particular mode/submode.
Experimentally, multiple branched Ic(H) patterns and multiple maxima in the Ic
probability distribution were observed for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x intrinsic SJJs,
which are in a good agreement with numerical simulations and support the idea
of having different quasi-equilibrium fluxon modes/submodes in intrinsic SJJs.

electric field exists. The electric field induced by a charge accelerated by an
external (nongravitational) force, is not accelerated with the charge. Hence
the electric field is curved in the instantanous rest frame of the accelerated

overcome the stress force is the source of the energy carried by the radiation.

Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation (FDR) at all temperatures between the quantum

gauge field theory in which all gauge fields have the same mass can well be set
up on the gauge-invariance principle. The quantization of the fields was
performed by different methods. In this paper, It is proved that the quantum
theory is invariant with respect to a kind of BRST-transformations. From the
BRST-invariance of the theory, the Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by the
generating functionals of full Green's functions, connected Green's functions
and proper vertex functions are successively derived. As an application of the
above Ward-Takahashi identity, the Ward-Takahashi identity obeyed by the
massive gauge boson propagator is derived and the renormalization of the
propagator is discussed. Furthermore, based on the Ward-Takahashi identity, it
is exactly proved that the S-matrix elements given by the quantum theory are
gauge-independent and hence unitary.

the former papers is renormalizable. This conclusion is achieved with the aid
of the Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by the generating functionals which
were derived in the preceding paper based on the BRST-symmetry of the theory.
By the use of the Ward-Takahashi identity, it is proved that the divergences
occurring in the perturbative calculations for the massive gauge field theory
can be eliminated by introducing a finite number of counterterms in the
effective action. As a result of the proof, it is found that the
renormalization constants for the massive gauge field theory comply with the
same Slavnov-Taylor identity as that for the massless gauge field theory. The
latter identity is re-derived from the Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by
the gluon proper vertices and their renormalization.

gauge invariance excludes the possibility of giving a mass to the gauge boson

the principle of gauge invariance actually allows a mass term to enter the

well be established by using a BRST-invariant action which is constructed by
the Lagrange undetermined multiplier procedure of incorporating the Lorentz

mechanism and for a boundary-limited wavenumber-band of Taylor-vortex flow
(TVF). The system consists of fluid contained between two concentric cylinders
with the inner one rotating at an angular frequency $\Omega$. As observed
previously, the Eckhaus instability (a bulk instability) is observed and limits
the stable wavenumber band when the system is terminated axially by two rigid,
non-rotating plates. The band width is then of order $\epsilon^{1/2}$ at small
$\epsilon$ ($\epsilon \equiv \Omega/\Omega_c - 1$) and agrees well with
calculations based on the equations of motion over a wide $\epsilon$-range.
When the cylinder axis is vertical and the upper liquid surface is free (i.e.
an air-liquid interface), vortices can be generated or expelled at the free
surface because there the phase of the structure is only weakly pinned. The
band of wavenumbers over which Taylor-vortex flow exists is then more narrow
than the stable band limited by the Eckhaus instability. At small $\epsilon$
the boundary-mediated band-width is linear in $\epsilon$. These results are
qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, but to our knowledge a
quantitative calculation for TVF with a free surface does not exist.

  liquid crystal","15 pages incl. 23 eps figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.58.5885","TPA98","patt-sol nlin.PS",,"  We report experimental results for convection near onset in a thin layer of a
homeotropically aligned nematic liquid crystal heated from below as a function
of the temperature difference $\Delta T$ and the applied vertical magnetic
field $H$ and compare them with theoretical calculations. The experiments cover
the field range $8 \alt h \equiv H/ H_{F} \alt 80$ ($H_F =$ is the
Fr\'eedericksz field). For $h$ less than a codimension-two field $h_{ct} \simeq
46$ the bifurcation is subcritical and oscillatory, with travelling- and
standing-wave transients. Beyond $h_{ct}$ the bifurcation is stationary and
subcritical until a tricritical field $h_t= 57.2$ is reached, beyond which it
is supercritical. The bifurcation sequence as a function of $h$ found in the
experiment confirms the qualitative aspects of the theoretical predictions.
However, the value of $h_{ct}$ is about 10% higher than the predicted value and
the results for $k_c$ are systematically below the theory by about 2% at small
$h$ and by as much as 7% near $h_{ct}$. At $h_{ct}$, $k_c$ is continuous within
the experimental resolution whereas the theory indicates a 7% discontinuity.
The theoretical tricritical field $h_t^{th} = 51$ is somewhat below the
experimental one. The fully developed flow above $R_c$ for $h < h_{ct}$ is
chaotic. For $h_{ct} < h < h_t$ the subcritical stationary bifurcation also
leads to a chaotic state. The chaotic states persist upon reducing the Rayleigh
number below $R_c$, i.e. the bifurcation is hysteretic. Above the tricritical
field $h_t$, we find a bifurcation to a time independent pattern which within
our resolution is non-hysteretic.

Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum
algorithms to perform approximate counting, which can be seen as an amplitude
