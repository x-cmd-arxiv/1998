z=0.4274, based on spectra and imaging in a field of size 9 arcmin by 23 arcmin
(~2 by 5 h**-1 Mpc). The sample comprises 277 galaxies, of which 112 are
cluster members, 7 are `near-members', and 47 are field galaxies in the
redshift range 0.37<=z<=0.50. The results are analyzed and compared with the
z=0.2279 rich cluster Abell 2390. MS1621.5+2640 has a higher blue fraction, a
younger stellar population, and is a less evolved cluster. We do not find
strong evidence of significant excess star formation compared with the field,
although there is a small population of outlying near-members that is unusually
blue and that may be affected by the cluster. There is a substantial population
of red galaxies with significant Hdelta absorption, which are not easily
explained by any simple form of modeled star formation history. We detect two
distinct populations of cluster galaxies: those where star formation ceased
some time ago, and those with a gradual decrease over many Gyr. Our data
suggests that the cluster formed by accretion from the field, with truncation
of the star formation beginning at very large radii (>2 times the virial
radius). The truncation process does not seem to be a sharp one though, in that
lower-luminosity early-type galaxies in the inner core of the cluster are seen
with significant Hdelta absorption, indicating some star formation within the
last 1-2 Gyr. Some combination of stripping of gas from the outer parts of the
galaxy, together with gradual exhaustion of the gas in the inner parts would be
consistent with our data.

detection of a broad iron Ka line which is well explained as being a

Redshift Survey (SSRS2). Over the range -22 \le M_B \le -14 ($H_0 = 100
km/s/Mpc), the luminosity function of early-type galaxies is well fitted by a
Schechter function with parameters M_*=-19.37^{+0.10}_{-0.11},
alpha=-1.00^{+0.09}_{-0.09} and phi_*=0.0044 +/- 0.0008 Mpc^{-3}. The spiral

M_*=-19.43^{+0.08}_{-0.08}, alpha=-1.11^{+0.07}_{-0.06} and phi_*=0.0080 +/-
0.0014 Mpc^{-3} over the same range in absolute magnitude. The flat faint end
of the early-type luminosity function is consistent with earlier measurements
from the CfA Redshift Survey (Marzke et al. 1994) but is significantly steeper
than the slope measured in the Stromlo-APM survey (Loveday et al. 1992).
Combined with the increased normalization of the overall LF measured from
intermediate redshift surveys, the flat faint-end slope of the E/S0 LF produces
no-evolution models which reproduce the deep HST counts of early-type galaxies
remarkably well. However, the observed normalization of the SSRS2 LF is
consistent with the low value measured in other local redshift surveys. The
cause of this low-redshift anomaly remains unknown. The luminosity function of
irregular and peculiar galaxies in the SSRS2 is very steep:
M_*=-19.78^{+0.40}_{-0.50}, alpha=-1.81^{+0.24}_{-0.24} and phi_*=0.0002 +/-
0.00008 Mpc^{-3}. The steep slope is consistent with the LFs measured for Sm-Im
galaxies in the CfA survey, UV-selected galaxies (Treyer et al. 1997),
star-forming field galaxies (Bromley et al. 1997) and the bluest galaxies in
the SSRS2 (Marzke & da Costa 1997).

for a young stellar population with the observed Ly alpha flux. The spectral
energy distribution can be fit satisfactorily for such a young stellar
population when absorption by dust is included. The models imply a reddening
0.1 mag < E(B-V) < 0.4 mag. The stellar mass of the lensed galaxy lies in the
range of 2 to 16 x 10^9 Msun. This is significantly higher than estimates based
on the HST data alone. Our data imply that absorption by dust is important to
redshifts of ~5.

certain inhomogeneous differential equation. As a result, we obtained for the
DP a closed analytical expression valid for all principal quantum numbers, n.
Within a framework of such an approach we succeeded both in retrieving the well
known results and finding several new ones, as well.Our interest is focused
mainly on the states with low n, n=1,2, since they are of particular
importance.Various analytical properties of the DP of such levels are discussed
in full details. Numerical values of light-shifts are computed for those
energies and intensities of the laser field that are used in the 1S-2S
experimental investigation of the muonium atom.

and it is explained why the difficulties encountered by Unruh do not actually
arise.

measurement on a beam splitter is studied. In the scheme, a mode prepared in a
squeezed vacuum is mixed with a mode prepared in a Fock state and photocounting
is performed in one of the output channels of the beam splitter. In this way
the mode in the other output channel is prepared in a Schr\""odinger-cat-like
state that is either a photon-subtracted or a photon-added Jacobi polynomial
squeezed vacuum state, depending upon the difference between the number of
photons in the input Fock state and the number of photons in the output Fock
state onto which it is projected. Two possible photocounting schemes are
considered, and the problem of monitoring cats that are ``hidden'' in a
statistical mixture of states is studied.
