Object Spectrograph of the HST as part of the Quasar Absorption Line Survey, a
Key Project for the first four cycles of HST observations. This is the third of
a series of catalogues of absorption lines produced from the survey and
increases the number of quasars whose higher resolution (R=1300) spectra we
have published from 17 to 83. The general properties and execution of the
survey are reviewed, including descriptions of the final sample of observed
objects and the algorithmic processes used to construct the catalogue. The
detection of a single damped Ly-a system in a path length of Delta_z=49 yields
an observed number of damped systems per unit redshift of
(dN/dz)_{damp}(z=0.58)=0.020 with 95% confidence boundaries of 0.001 to 0.096
systems per unit redshift. We include notes on our analysis of each of the
observed quasars and the absorption systems detected in each spectrum. Some
especially interesting systems include low redshift Ly-a absorbers suitable for
extensive follow-up observations (in the spectra of TON28 and PG1216+069),
possibly physically associated pairs of extensive metal line absorption systems
(e.g., in the spectrum of PG0117+213), and systems known to be associated with
galaxies (e.g., in the spectrum of 3C232).

  Letters","Astron.Astrophys.338:L83-L86,1998",,,"astro-ph",,"  The X-ray light curve and broad band spectral properties of the millisecond
X-ray pulsar/burster SAX J1808.4-3658 are reported. In the course of RXTE
observations in April--May 1998 the 3--150 keV luminosity of the source
decreased by a factor of ~100 from the peak value of ~9E36 erg/s (for a 4 kpc
distance). However, the spectrum was remarkably stable and maintained a roughly
power law shape with a photon index of ~2 without a strong high energy cut-off
below 100 keV, similar to that sometimes observed in the low spectral state of
X-ray bursters. An approximation of the averaged spectrum with an exponentially
cut-off power law with a superimposed reflected component yields the 90% lower
limit on the e-folding energy ~270 keV. We speculate that Comptonization on the
bulk motion in the radiation dominated shock might be a possible mechanism of
spectral formation. The decaying part of the X-ray light curve was cut off
abruptly at luminosity ~few 1E35 erg/s. Such behavior might be due to
centrifugal inhibition of accretion (transition to the ``propeller'' regime) as
well as to disk instability. In either case an upper limit on the neutron star
magnetic field strength is B < few 1E7 Gauss.

wavelengths of BrGamma and H2(1,0)S(1), and imaging spectroscopy centered on
[NeII](12.8um). We use these data and data from the literature in a
comprehensive re-assessment of the starburst in this galaxy. We derive the
supernova rate from the strength of the infrared [FeII] lines. We find that
most of the H2 infrared luminosity is excited by fluorescence in low density
gas. We derive a strong upper limit of ~37,000K for the stars exciting the
emission lines. We use velocity-resolved infrared spectra to determine the mass
in the starburst region. Most of this mass appears to be locked up in the old,
pre-existing stellar population. Using these constraints and others to build an
evolutionary synthesis model, we find that the IMF originally derived to fit
the starburst in M 82 (similar to a Salpeter IMF) also accounts for the
properties of NGC 253. The models indicate that rapid massive star formation
has been ongoing for 20-30 million years in NGC 253---that is, it is in a late
phase of its starburst. We model the optical emission line spectrum expected
from a late phase starburst and demonstrate that it reproduces the observed
HII/weak-[OI] LINER characteristics.

from Ginga, ASCA, OSSE and EXOSAT. The X-ray spectra are well fitted by an
intrinsic power-law continuum with an energy index of alpha ~ 0.7, moderately
absorbed by a cold medium. In addition, the Ginga spectra show Fe K-alpha lines
with an average equivalent width of ~ 100 eV, and, in some cases, Compton
reflection humps. However, the latter components are significantly weaker than
both those seen in radio-quiet Seyferts and those expected if the Fe K-alpha
lines were due to reflection. Some ASCA and EXOSAT spectra show soft X-ray
excesses below ~ 3 keV. When that component is taken into account, the Fe
K-alpha lines in the ASCA data become unresolved with equivalent widths < 200
eV. Multiple observations of 3C 390.3 and 3C 382 show the Fe K-alpha line
approximately constant in flux but accompanied by strong continuum variations.
This indicates the bulk of the line is formed by matter at a distance much
larger than an accretion-disk scale, consistent with the ASCA line width
measurements. The column density of the matter required to account for the
observed line fluxes is N_H > 10^23 cm^-2. Such a medium is in the
line-of-sight in 3C 445 but it has to be out of it in other objects, in which
the observed N_H are substantially lower. Thus, a cold medium with that N_H and
covering a large solid angle is out of the line-of-sight in most objects. The
spectra of BLRGs break and become softer above ~ 100 keV, as shown by a
simultaneous ASCA/OSSE observation of 3C 120 and by the OSSE spectra being on
average much softer than the X-ray spectra. Finally, we find the X-ray and
gamma-ray spectral properties of Cen A intrinsically very similar to BLRGs
studied here.

and CL1604+4304 (z=0.90) are part of a multi-wavelength program to study nine
candidate clusters at z > 0.6 (Oke, Postman & Lubin 1998). Based on these
observations, we study in detail both the field and cluster populations. From
the confirmed cluster members, we find that CL0023+0423 actually consists of
two components separated by ~2900 km/s. A kinematic analysis indicates that the
two components are a poor cluster with ~3 x 10^{14} solar masses and a less
massive group with 10^{13} solar masses. CL1604+4304 is a centrally
concentrated, rich cluster at z = 0.8967 with a velocity dispersion of 1226
km/s and a mass of ~3 x 10^{15} solar masses. Approximately 57% and 50% of the
galaxies show high levels of star formation in CL0023+0423 and CL1604+4304,
respectively. These numbers are significantly larger than those found in
intermediate redshift clusters. We also observe many old, red galaxies. Found
mainly in CL1604+4304, they have spectra consistent with passive stellar
evolution, typical of the early-type galaxies in low and intermediate-redshift
clusters. We have calculated their ages by comparing their spectral energy
distributions to standard Bruzual & Charlot evolutionary models. We find that
their colors are consistent with models having an exponentially decreasing star
formation rate with a time constant of 0.6 Gyr. We observe a significant
luminosity brightening in our brightest cluster galaxies. Compared to BCGs at z

redshifts of QSO emission and metal-line absorptions to our available filters.
The survey depth is 7E-17 ergs/cm^2/s (3sigma) in H-alpha and K-prime ~22.
Eleven H-alpha-emitters, plus two Seyfert I objects, have been discovered. The
high density of galaxy detections, corresponding to a co-moving volume density
of 0.0135/Mpc^3, makes it unlikely that all of the H-alpha flux in these
objects is the result of active nuclei. There is a strong suggestion of
clustering in the environments of metal-line absorbers. Each candidate galaxy
lies typically within a projected distance of 250kpc of the QSO line of sight

12695 has an unusual morphology, consisting of a Y-shaped nucleus surrounded by
a faint spiral arm with a number of bright H II regions interspersed throughout
the galaxy. Surface photometry indicates the majority of recent star formation
in this galaxy occurred in these very localized regions, most of which have a
radius of < 2''. This uneven stellar distribution combined with the galaxy's
overall extremely blue color and low metallicity indicates UGC 12695 is an
unevolved galaxy.
  Some of the structural peculiarities of this galaxy arise because a number of
background galaxies, previously thought to be morphological components of this
galaxy, are showing through both the outer nucleus and spiral arms of UGC
12695. Surface photometry of these galaxies shows them to be fairly small
(alpha < 1.8'') disk galaxies with total magnitudes ranging from 19.6 through
24.2, and central surface brightnesses between 20.2 mag/arcsec^2 < mu(0) < 23.1

measured using ground-based images, which show the galaxies to be fairly red

galaxies are masked out, the resultant U-I color of UGC 12695 is -0.2 +/- 0.1,
making it perhaps the bluest galaxy every measured in this color system and
confirming its nature as a very unevolved galaxy at low redshift.Spectroscopy
of these background galaxies, through the transparent disk of UGC 12695, may

numerical experiments to test if and how aspherical fast winds effect wind
blown bubble morphologies. Our experiments explore a variety of models for the

demonstrate that aspherical fast winds can produce strongly bipolar outflows.
In addition the properties of outflows recover some important aspects of LBV

5.4 to 14.1 kpc, corresponding to an age (1-20)x10^3 yr. On the basis of the
SNR's morphology we argue that it is a younger analogue of the W50/SS433
system, and that its unusual appearance is a result of opposed jets or outflows
from a central source. A jet-like feature and breaks in the shell can both be
seen along the axis of proposed outflow, providing further support for this
interpretation; the central source itself is not detected. The SNR may be
interacting with the adjacent HII region RCW 80 through an extension of the
proposed outflow beyond its shell. This would put the SNR at the lower limit of
its distance range and would imply an age <4000 yr. We consider other SNRs
similar to G309.2-00.6, and propose remnants whose shells are affected by jets
as one of several classes of SNR from which the presence of a central source
can be inferred.

galaxies, characterized by larger than average HI-to-optical sizes. Our deep
Halpha images have revealed the existence of recent massive star formation,
traced by HII regions, out to, and beyond, two optical radii in these galaxies
(defined by the B-band 25th magnitude isophote). Optical spectra of these
newly-discovered HII regions are used to investigate their densities,
ionization parameters, extinctions and in particular their oxygen and nitrogen
abundances. Our measurements reveal gas-phase abundances of O/H~10-15% of the
solar value, and N/O~20-25% of the solar value, at radii of 1.5-2 R25. Clear
evidence also exists for diminished dust extinction (Av~0-0.2) at large radii.
The combination of our measurements of outer disk HII region abundances with
those for inner disk HII regions published in the literature is a powerful
probe of the shape of abundance gradients over unprecedented radial baselines.
Within the limits of the current dataset, the radial abundance variations are
consistent with single log-linear relationships, although the derived slopes
can often differ considerably from those found if only inner disk HII regions
are used to define the fit. Interestingly, both the mean level of enrichment
and the ratio of N/O measured in extreme outer galactic disks are similar to
those values measured in some high redshift damped Lyman-alpha absorbers,
suggesting that outer disks at the present epoch are relatively unevolved.

previously. It turns out that the nearby ($z \lesssim 0.1$) sources are the
dominant contributors to the large-angle fluctuations. If these nearby sources
are removed in an observed X-ray map, the dipole (low multipole) moment of the
fluctuation drastically decreases. In this case the Compton-Getting effect of
an observer's motion can be a dominant contribution to the dipole fluctuation.
This feature of fluctuation, relating to the matter power spectrum, is
discussed.

extrasolar planet candidates with the distribution of low-mass secondaries in
spectroscopic binaries. We choose to use a logarithmic scale to study the
combined mass distribution, because of the large range of masses, 0.5-300
Jupiter masses, involved.
  Although the results are based on a very small number of systems, the
combined distribution looks different at the high- and low-ends. At the
high-mass end the distribution drops steeply from 200 to 20 Jupiter masses. At
the planetary range of masses the distribution is flat, and might even rise
mildly from, say, 20 to 0.6 Jupiter masses, depending on the assumed detection
threshold for the precise surveys. The transition region between the two slopes
is at about 10-30 Jupiter masses.
  One possible interpretation of this result is that we have here two different
populations. Maybe the lower-mass population was formed like planets, out of an
accretion disc, while the high-mass population was formed like binary stars. If
the shape of the combined distribution can be verified by many more detections,
and if the planetary-mass objects prove to be extrasolar planets, this can give
us the long-sought clue for how to distinguish planets from low-mass stellar
companions.

Exceptional points are the singularities of the spectrum and eigenfunctions,
when they are considered as functions of a coupling parameter. In the present
paper this parameter is the coupling strength to the continuum. It is shown
that the positions of the exceptional points (their accumulation point in the
thermodynamical limit) depend on the particular type and energy dependence of
the coupling to the continuum in the same way as the transition point of the
corresponding phase transition.
