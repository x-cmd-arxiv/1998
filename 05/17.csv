observed in the course of the OGLE microlensing experiment: 73 stars from the
Galactic bulge and 110 and 128 stars from selected fields in the LMC and SMC,
respectively. The fields are the same as in the recent distance determination
to the Magellanic Clouds with the red clump stars method by Udalski et al
(1998). We determine the relative distance scale d_{GB}:d_{LMC}:d_{SMC} equal
to: (0.194+/-0.010):1.00:(1.30+/-0.08). We calibrate our RR Lyr distance scale
with the recent calibration of Gould and Popowski (1998) based on statistical
parallaxes. We obtain the following distance moduli to the Galactic bulge, LMC
and SMC: m-M=14.53+/-0.15, m-M=18.09+/-0.16 and m-M=18.66+/-0.16 mag.
  We use the RR Lyr mean V-band luminosity at the Galactic bulge metallicity as
the reference brightness and analyze the mean, I-band luminosity of the red
clump stars in objects with different ages and metallicities. We add to our
analysis the metal poor Carina dwarf galaxy which contains old RR Lyr stars and
intermediate age red clump population. We find a weak dependence of the mean
red clump brightness on metallicity and we calibrate its zero point with the
nearby local red clump stars measured by Hipparcos: M^{RC}_I=(0.09+/-0.03)
*[Fe/H]^{RC}-0.23+/-0.03. Our revised red clump distance moduli to the Galactic
bulge, LMC and SMC are m-M=14.53+/-0.06, m-M=18.13+/-0.07 and m-M=18.63+/-0.07
mag, respectively. The distance modulus to the Carina galaxy is m-M=19.84+/-
0.07 mag. Excellent agreement of RR Lyr and red clump distances which have
independent absolute calibrations confirms the short distance scale to the LMC.

velocities, and subsequent radial offsets of coalescing neutron stars (NSs) in
various galactic potentials accounting for large asymmetric kicks introduced
during a supernovae. The birthrates of bound NS-NS binaries are quite sensitive
to the magnitude of the kick velocities but are, nevertheless, similar (~10 per
Galaxy per Myr) to previous population synthesis studies. The distribution of
merger times since zero-age main sequence is, however, relatively insensitive
to the choice of kick velocities. With a median merger time of ~100 Myr, we
find that compact binaries should closely trace the star formation rate in the
Universe.
  In a range of plausible galactic potentials (M_galaxy > 3 x 10^10 M_solar)
the median radial offset of a NS-NS mergers is less than 10 kpc. At a redshift
of z=1 (with H_0 = 65 km/s/Mpc and Omega = 0.2), this means that half the
coalescences should occur within ~1.3 arcsec from the host galaxy. In all but
the most shallow potentials, ninety percent of NS-NS binaries merge within 30
kpc of the host. We find that although the spatial distribution of coalescing
neutron star binaries is consistent with the close spatial association of known
optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with faint galaxies, a
non-negligible fraction (~15 percent) of GRBs should occur well outside (>30
kpc) dwarf galaxy hosts. Extinction due to dust in the host, projection of
offsets, and a range in interstellar medium densities confound the true
distribution of NS-NS mergers around galaxies with an observable set of optical
transients/galaxy offsets.

systems of constituent quarks with confining interaction and a chiral
interaction that is mediated by Goldstone bosons as well as by vector and
scalar mesons. The flavor-spin structure and sign of the short-range part of
the spin-spin force reduces the $SU(6)_{FS}$ symmetry down to $SU(3)_F \times
SU(2)_S$, induces hyperfine splittings and provides correct ordering of the
lowest states with positive and negative parity. There is a cancellation of the
tensor force from pseudoscalar- and vector-exchanges in baryons. The spin-orbit
interactions from $\rho$-like and $\omega$-like exchanges also cancel each
other in baryons while they produce a big spin-orbit force in NN system. A
unified description of light and strange baryon spectra calculated in a
semirelativistic framework is presented. It is demonstrated that the same
short-range part of spin-spin interaction between the constituent quarks
induces a strong short-range repulsion in $NN$ system when the latter is
treated as $6Q$ system. Thus one can achieve a simultaneous understanding of a
