emission from our own solar system and Galaxy. This paper describes procedures
for removing the Galactic IR emission from the 1.25 - 240 micron COBE DIRBE
maps as steps toward the ultimate goal of detecting the CIB. The Galactic
emission models are carefully chosen and constructed so that the isotropic CIB
is completely retained in the residual sky maps. We start with DIRBE data from
which the scattered light and thermal emission of the interplanetary dust (IPD)
cloud have already been removed. Locations affected by the emission from bright
compact and stellar sources are excluded from the analysis. The unresolved
emission of faint stars at near- and mid-IR wavelengths is represented by a
model based on Galactic source counts. The 100 micron DIRBE observations are
used as the spatial template for the interstellar medium (ISM) emission at high
latitudes. Correlation of the 100 micron data with H I column density allows us
to isolate the component of the observed emission that is associated with the
ISM. Limits are established on the far-IR emissivity of the diffuse ionized
medium, which indicate a lower emissivity per H nucleus than in the neutral
medium. At 240 micron, we find that adding a second spatial template to the ISM
model can greatly improve the accuracy of the model at low latitudes. The
crucial product of this analysis is a set of all-sky IR maps from which the
Galactic (and IPD) emission has been removed. We discuss systematic
uncertainties and potential errors in the foreground subtraction process that
may have an impact on studies seeking to detect the CIB in the residual maps.

combination of observations from the ground and with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) has shown that NGC 4342 rotates rapidly and has a strong central increase
in velocity dispersion. We construct simple two-integral Jeans models as well
as fully general, three-integral models. The latter are built using a modified
version of Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition technique. The two-integral
Jeans models suggest a black hole (BH) mass between 3 and 6x10^8 Msun,
depending on the data set used to constrain the model, but they fail to fit the
details of the observed kinematics. The three-integral models can fit all
ground-based and HST data simultaneously, but only when a central BH is
included. Models without BH are ruled out to a confidence level better than
99.73 per cent. We determine a BH mass of 3x10^8 Msun. This corresponds to 2.6
per cent of the total mass of the bulge, making NGC 4342 one of the galaxies
with the highest BH mass to bulge mass ratio currently known. The models that
best fit the data do not have a two-integral phase-space distribution function.
They have rather complex dynamical structures: the velocity anisotropies are
strong functions of radius reflecting the multi-component structure of this
galaxy. The best fit model without BH tries to fit the high central velocity
dispersion by placing stars on radial orbits. The measured rotation velocities,
however, restrict the amount of radial anisotropy such that the central
velocity dispersion measured with the HST can only be fit when a massive BH is
included in the models.

be directly proportional to the rate of formation of supernovae in the galaxy.
Since decimetric radiation does not suffer significant extinction and is not
directive, radio luminosities may thus provide a particularly straightforward
way to determine the current rate of star formation. Using a sample of over 700
local galaxies we confirm the utility of the radio luminosity as a measure of
star formation rate by showing concordance with the rates predicted by U-band,
H-alpha, and far-infrared luminosites. We also show that there are systematic
discrepancies between these various indicators, suggesting that the H-alpha
luminosity may underestimate the star formation rate by approximately an order
of magnitude when the star formation rate is more than 20 solar mass per year.
We use this calibration and the measured radio luminosities of sub-mJy radio
sources to infer the star formation rate in approximately 60 star-forming
galaxies at moderate (z = 0.1) redshifts, both as the actual rate and as the
fraction of the existing mass of stars in the galaxy. For some of these objects
the inferred current rate of star formation could increase the stellar mass in

Based on its variability, compactness and spectrum, we identify VLA
J070238.0+385044 as the afterglow from GRB 980329. We interpret the rapid flux
density variations as interstellar scintillation and the sharp turnover in the
radio spectrum below 13 GHz as arising from synchrotron self-absorption. This
suggests that the angular diameter of the fireball from GRB 980329 was of order
a few microarcseconds in the first two weeks. The absence of a readily
detectable afterglow in the optical, but clear detections in both the radio and
infrared, can be understood as the result of extinction by dust. In this
context it is interesting to note that half of all well-localized gamma-ray
bursts have no optical counterpart. Based on our study of GRB 980329 we suggest
that the progenitors of a sizable fraction of gamma-ray bursts are associated

are the game dynamical equations of evolutionary game theory.
  The stochastic version of the game dynamical equations allows the derivation
of covariance equations. These should always be solved along with the ordinary
game dynamical equations. On the one hand, the average behavior is affected by
the covariances so that the game dynamical equations must be corrected for
increasing covariances. Otherwise they may become invalid in the course of
time. On the other hand, the covariances are a measure for the reliability of
game dynamical descriptions. An increase of the covariances beyond a critical
value indicates a phase transition, i.e. a sudden change in the properties of
the considered social system.
  The applicability and use of the introduced equations are illustrated by
computational results for the social self-organization of behavioral
conventions.

higher concentrations of the component with the lower surface free energy. The
binodals close the the critical point are flattened compared to the bulk and
exhibit a convex curvature at intermediate temperatures -- a signature of the
wetting transition in the semi-infinite system. Investigating the spectrum of
capillary fluctuation of the interface bound to the wall, we find evidence for
a position dependence of the interfacial tension. This goes along with a
distortion of the interfacial profile from its bulk shape. Using an extended
ensemble in which the monomer-wall interaction is a stochastic variable, we
accurately measure the difference between the surface energies of the
components, and determine the location of the wetting transition via the Young
equation. The Flory-Huggins parameter at which the strong first order wetting
transition occurs is independent of chain length and grows quadratically with
the integrated wall-monomer interaction strength. We estimate the location of
the prewetting line. The prewetting manifests itself in a triple point in the
phase diagram of very thick films and causes spinodal dewetting of ultrathin
layers slightly above the wetting transition. We investigate the early stage of
dewetting via dynamic Monte Carlo simulations.

geometries allow to design the optimum tip for the most localised electric
field. The electron-beam-deposition (EBD) technique makes it possible to
actually produce tips of the desired geometry.

the beams in the energy range $E_\gamma$ smaller than 240 eV.

measuring beam parameters. Indeed, the bunch length $\sigma_z$ can be found
from the CBS spectrum because critical energy $E_c \propto 1/\sigma_z$; the
horizontal transverse bunch size $\sigma_x $ is related to $dN_\gamma \propto
1/\sigma_x^2$. Besides, CBS may be very useful for a fast control over an
impact parameter $R$ between the colliding bunch axex because a dependence of

explicitly the $SL(3, Z)$ superstrings and $SL(3, Z) \times SL(2, Z)$ 0-branes
as well as their corresponding magnetic duals in $D = 8$. For the $SL(3, Z)$
superstrings (3-branes), each of them is characterized by a triplet of integers
corresponding to the electric-like (magnetic-like) charges associated with the
three 2-form gauge potentials present in the theory. For the $SL(3, Z)\times
SL(2,Z)$ 0-branes (4-branes), each of them is labelled by a pair of triplets of
integers corresponding to the electric-like (magnetic-like) charges associated
with the two sets of three 1-form gauge potentials. The string (3-brane)
tension and central charge are shown to be given by $SL(3, Z)$ invariant
expressions. It is argued that when any two of the three integers in the
integral triplet are relatively prime to each other, the corresponding string
(3-brane) is stable and does not decay into multiple strings (3-branes) by a
`tension gap' or `charge gap' equation. Similar results hold also for the
0-branes (4-branes). Alongwith the $SL(2, Z)$ dyonic membranes of Izquierdo et.
al., these examples provide a further support for the conjectured $SL(3, Z)

q-group $GL_{q,r}(N)$ we construct the inhomogeneous q-group $IGL_{q,r}(N)$ as
a projection from $GL_{q,r}(N+1)$, i.e. as a quotient of $GL_{q,r}(N+1)$ with
respect to a suitable Hopf algebra ideal.
  The semidirect product structure of $IGL_{q,r}(N)$ given by the $GL_{q,r}(N)$
q-subgroup times translations is easily analized. A bicovariant calculus on
$IGL_{q,r}(N)$ is explicitly obtained as a projection from the one on
$GL_{q,r}(N+1)$. The universal enveloping algebra of $IGL_{q,r}(N)$ and its
$R$-matrix formulation are constructed along the same lines.
  We proceed similarly in the orthogonal and symplectic case. We find the
inhomogeneous multiparametric q-groups of the $B_n,C_n,D_n$ series via a
projection from $B_{n+1}, C_{n+1},D_{n+1}$. We give an $R$-matrix formulation
and discuss real forms. We study their universal enveloping algebras and
differential calculi. In particular we obtain the bicovariant calculus on a
dilatation-free minimal deformation of the Poincar\'e group $ISO_q(3,1)$.
  The projection procedure is also used to construct differential calculi on
multiparametric q-orthogonal planes in any dimension $N$. Real forms are
studied and in particular we obtain a q-Minkowski space and its q-deformed
phase-space with hermitian operators $x^a$ and $p_a$.

especially interesting because the nearest-neighbour spacing distribution P(s)

the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random--matrix theory. This contrasts with
other neighbouring nuclei which show fully chaotic spectral distributions. We
study the chaotic behaviour as a function of the excitation energy. In
addition, a clear signature of chaos suppression is obtained when the
single-particle spacings are increased. In our opinion the relatively weak
strength of the neutron-neutron interaction is unable to destroy the regular
single-particle mean-field motion completely. In the neighbouring nuclei with
both protons and neutrons in valence orbits, on the other hand, the stronger
proton-neutron interaction would appear to be sufficient to destroy the regular
mean-field motion.

depend on the direction of the measuring current, and in addition to damping or
dissipative effects, an energy shift of the measured system. In particular, the
phase shift effect leads to the conclusion that there can be effects of
