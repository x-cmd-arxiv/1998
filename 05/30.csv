$10^9 - 10^{10}$ \msun) are presented. The evolution is followed for times
longer than both the blowout time and the presumed span of energy injection
generated by a coeval massive stellar cluster. The remnants are shown to end up
wrapping around the central region of the host galaxy, while growing to
kpc-scale dimensions. Properties of the remnants such as luminosity, size,
swept up mass, and expansion speed are given as a function of time for all
calculated cases. The final fate of the swept-up galactic gas and of the matter
processed by the central starburst is shown to be highly-dependent on the
properties of the low density galactic halo. Superbubbles powered by star
clusters, with properties similar to those inferred from the observations, slow
down in the presence of an extended halo to expansion speeds smaller than the
host galaxy escape velocity. Values of the critical luminosity required for the
superbubbles to reach the edge of the galaxies with a speed comparable to the
escape speed are derived analytically and numerically. The critical
luminosities are larger than those in the detected sources and thus, the
superbubbles in amorphous dwarf galaxies must have already undergone blowout
and are presently evolving into an extended low density halo. This will inhibit
the loss of the swept-up and processed matter from the galaxy.

distribution or the reddening law of the obscuring material. The method is to
measure the colors and counts of background galaxies which can be identified
through the foreground system. The method is calibrated, and the effects of
confusion and obscuration are decoupled by adding various versions of a
suitable deep reference frame containing only field galaxies with known
properties into the image of the foreground galaxy, and analyzing these
``synthetic field'' images in the same way as the real images. We test the
method on HST WFPC2 archived images of two galaxies which are quite different:
NGC 4536 is a large Sc spiral, and NGC 3664 is a small Magellanic irregular.
The reference frames are taken from the Hubble Deep Field.
  From the background galaxy counts, NGC 4536 shows an extinction A_I ~ 1 mag
in the northwestern arm region, and lower than 0.5 mag in the corresponding
interarm region (no correction for inclination has been attempted). However,
from the galaxy colors, the same reddening of E(V - I) ~ 0.2 is observed in
both the arm and the interarm regions. In the interarm region, the combination
of extinction and reddening can be explained by a diffuse component with a
Galactic reddening law (R_V ~ 3). In the spiral arm, however, the same diffuse,
low opacity component seems to coexist with regions of much higher opacity.
Since the exposures are shorter the results for NGC 3664 are less clear, but
also appear to be consistent with a two component distribution.

disk galaxies is examined. In particular, we use numerical simulation to
estimate the minimum mass black hole (BH) needed to destroy a bar. Initially,
bars form in the disks via dynamical instability. Thereafter, once a bar is
fully developed, a BH is adiabatically added at the center of the disk. To
mitigate the global effects of gravitational softening, Poisson's equation for
the disk is solved by expanding the density and potential of the galaxy in a
set of basis functions.
  Our results indicate that a bar can be completely destroyed in a time much
smaller than a Hubble time if the central mass exceeds about 0.5% of the disk
mass. Since the implied minimum BH mass for bar destruction is of order
10^{8.5} solar masses for a typical disk galaxy, this process should not be a
rare phenomenon. The bar amplitude decreases gradually with time after the BH
is added, and the rate at which the bar is destroyed increases with increasing
BH mass. This suggests that bar destruction arises from scattering of stars
that support the bar as they pass close to the center.

The galaxies were classified in four activity classes: galaxies without
emission, starburst nucleus galaxies (SBNGs), luminous AGNs and low-luminosity
AGNs (LLAGNs).
  The star formation in the HCG starbursts is more intense than in normal
spirals, but comparable to those in the field SBNGs. Their mean gas metallicity
is solar and they do not follow the metallicity-luminosity relation traced by
the early-type SBNGs in the field, suggesting that most of them are late-type
SBNGs. This morphology preference coupled to the observation that the HCG
starbursts are predominantly in the halo of the groups is consistent with the
idea that compact groups are embedded in sparser structures.
  The stellar metallicities of the non starburst galaxies are relatively high
for their luminosities. In these galaxies the equivalent widths of the metal
absorption lines are slightly narrower than normal while the Balmer absorption
lines are relatively strong. All these galaxies could be ``post-starburst'' at
an advanced stage of evolution.
  Our observations are supporting a scenario where the core of the groups are
slowly collapsing evolved systems embedded in more extended structures (Ribeiro
et al. 1998). In the core of the groups, the interactions were more frequent
and the galaxies evolved at a more rapid rate than in their halos.

of the system tailored to signers of American Sign Language (ASL). We discuss
the theoretical motivations for the system, various difficulties that have been
encountered in the implementation, as well as the methods we have used to
overcome these problems. Our method of capturing ungrammaticalities involves
using mal-rules (also called 'error productions'). However, the straightforward
addition of some mal-rules causes significant performance problems with the
parser. For instance, the ASL population has a strong tendency to drop pronouns
and the auxiliary verb `to be'. Being able to account for these as sentences
results in an explosion in the number of possible parses for each sentence.
This explosion, left unchecked, greatly hampers the performance of the system.
We discuss how this is handled by taking into account expectations from the
specific population (some of which are captured in our unique user model). The
different representations of lexical items at various points in the acquisition
process are modeled by using mal-rules, which obviates the need for multiple
lexicons. The grammar is evaluated on its ability to correctly diagnose
agreement problems in actual sentences produced by ASL native speakers.

functional integration with holomorphic action. Second, one should find which

derive the BRST path integral for the Hilbert-Palatini gravity. We show, that
for certain class of gauge conditions this path integral can be re-written in

over cohomology, which bears resemblance to summing over topological sectors in
Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the case of string theory on a circle is
shown to be explicitly self-dual in the lattice regulated model and
automatically forbids vortex excitations which would otherwise destroy the
duality. For other target spaces a generalized notion of T-duality is observed
in which the target space and the cohomology coefficient group are interchanged
under duality. Specific examples show that the fundamental group of the target
space may not be preserved in the T-dual theory. Generalized models which
exhibit T-duality behaviour, with dynamical variables that live on the
k-dimensional cells of (p+1)-dimensional world-volumes, are also constructed.
These models correspond to gauge theories, and higher-dimensional analogues, in
which one sums over various topological sectors of the theory.

C",,,"University of Maryland TQHN Group PP\97-045","nucl-th hep-ph",,"  In this two part series a chiral confining model of baryons is used to
describe low--lying negative parity resonances $N^*$, $\Delta^*$, $\Lambda^*$
and $\Sigma^*$ in the mean field approximation. A physical baryon in this model
consists of interacting valence quarks, mesons and a color and chiral singlet
hybrid field coexisting inside a dynamically generated confining region. This
first paper presents the quark contribution to the masses and wave functions of
negative parity baryons calculated with an effective spin--isospin dependent
instanton induced interaction. It does not include meson exchanges between
quarks. The three--quark wave functions are used to calculate meson--excited
baryon vertex functions to lowest order in meson--quark coupling. When the
baryons are on mass--shell each of these vertex functions is a product of a
coupling constant and a form factor. As examples, quark contributions to $N^*$
hadronic form factors as well as axial coupling constants are extracted from
the vertex functions and problems with the analytical behaviour of the model
form factors are discussed. The second paper will examine the mesonic
corrections to excited baryon properties in the heavy baryon and one--loop
approximations.

Casimir force between a metallized sphere of diameter 196 microns and flat
plate. The force was measured for plate-sphere separations from 0.1 to 0.9
microns. The experimental results are consistent with present theoretical
calculations including the finite conductivity, roughness, and temperature
corrections. The root mean square average deviation of 1.6 pN between theory
and experiment corresponds to a 1% deviation at the smallest separation.

YbF molecule was performed with the help of the recently developed technique,
which allows to take into account correlations and polarization in the
outercore region. The ground state electronic wave function of the YbF molecule
is found with the help of the Relativistic Effective Core Potential method
followed by the restoration of molecular four-component spinors in the core
region of ytterbium in the framework of a non-variational procedure. Core
polarization effects are included with the help of the atomic Many Body
Perturbation Theory for Yb atom. For the isotropic hyperfine constant A,
accuracy of our calculation is about 3% as compared to the experimental datum.
The dipole constant Ad (which is much smaller in magnitude), though better than
in all previous calculations, is still underestimated by almost 23%. Being
corrected within a semiempirical approach for a perturbation of 4f-shell in the
core of Yb due to the bond making, this error is reduced to 8%. Our value for
the effective electric field on the unpaired electron is 4.9 a.u.=2.5E+10 V/cm.

  corrections in the revised version, no changes in the essential content",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The fundamental impasses and ruptures in various domains of the canonical,
unitary science, or the 'end of science', become the more and more evident. The
natural unity of being is recovered within a universal nonperturbative method
leading to the dynamic redundance paradigm. It is shown that the unreduced
behaviour of any nontrivial (isolated) system includes many equally real, but
incompatible dynamic regimes, each of them being roughly equivalent to an
ordinary 'complete' solution of the unitary science. Therefore the regimes
should 'spontaneously' and randomly replace one another, which provides a
universal, purely dynamic origin of randomness. The discovered dynamic
redundance leads to the universal, reality-based concept of dynamic complexity
and its permanently developing hierarchical structure, alias the world. Its
lowest levels give the causally complete mechanics of dynamically quantized
elementary fields, extending the double solution found by Louis de Broglie. One
obtains a physically complete solution for the 'mysteries' of quantum
mechanics, unifyng it with the extended, causal versions of relativity
(emergent space and time), quantum and classical gravity (dynamical mass),
field theory (electric charge and spin), particle physics, and cosmology. The
same key features of the unreduced dynamic complexity determine behaviour of
any system at higher levels of complexity described by a case of the single,
universal equation in its two related versions, the extended Lagrange-Hamilton
(trajectorial) and Schroedinger (distributional) equations. The end of the
unitary science opens the renaissance of the ultimately complete and universal
understanding initiated by Rene Descartes (but then mechanistically falsified),
which is confirmed by many sound, practically important results.

show that a single two-qubit Werner state, or any other mixture of the
maximally entangled Bell states, cannot be purified by local operations and
classical communications. We generalise their result and give a simple
explanation. In particular, we show that no purification scheme using local
operations and classical communications can produce a pure singlet from any
mixed state of two spin-1/2 particles. More generally, no such scheme can
produce a maximally entangled state of any pair of finite-dimensional systems
from a generic mixed state. We also show that the Werner states belong to a
large class of states whose fidelity cannot be increased by such a scheme.
