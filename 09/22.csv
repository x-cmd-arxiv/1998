cannot be neglected in solar models. Helium and metal diffusion is now
generally introduced in the computations. They cannot however explain the
observed lithium depletion. Macroscopic motions are needed to bring up to the
convection zone the nuclearly depleted matter. Such motions also lead to a
better agreement between the sound velocity in the model and that deduced from
the inversion of seismic modes. On the other hand, they must not bring up too
much $^3$He, as we now know that the $^3$He/$^4$He ratio cannot have changed by
more than 10 percent during these last 3 Gyr. Here we present new consistent
solar models in which the $^3$He constraint is satisfied. The fact that $^3$He
must remain constant while $^7$Li must be depleted leads to strong constraints
on the effective macroscopic diffusion coefficient allowed below the solar
convection zone.

open clusters (Hyades, Coma Berenices and Ursa Major), associations (parts of
the Scorpio-Centaurus association) as well as the Hyades evaporation track are
retrieved. Three new probably loose clusters are identified (Bootes, Pegasus 1

than 7 per cent of the stars belong to structures with coherent kinematics,
most likely gravitationally bound. In the velocity space, the majority of large
scale velocity structures ($\sigma$ ~ 6.3 $km s-1$) are Eggen's superclusters
(Pleiades SCl, Hyades SCl and Sirius SCl) with the whole Centaurus association.
A new supercluster-like structure is found with a mean velocity between the Sun

age range which reflects the overall sample age distribution. Moreover, a few
old streams of ~ 2 Gyr are also extracted at this scale with high U components.
We show that all these large velocity dispersion structures represent 46% of
the sample. Smaller scales (\sigma ~ 3.8 and 2.4 $km s-1$) reveal that
superclusters are always substructured by 2 or more streams which generally
exhibit a coherent age distribution. Percentages of stars in these streams are

the uncertainty of this SBF correction. Extensive consistency checks, including
an independent SBF analysis using an alternate software package, suggest that
our internal uncertainties are < 0.02 mag. The fluctuations magnitude for NGC

map out the spatial distribution of the early type galaxies in the supercluster

shear from a sample of \simeq 30,000 faint background galaxies in the range 22

2-dimensional reconstructions of the mass surface density. These recover all of
the major concentrations of galaxies and indicate that most of the supercluster
mass, like the early type galaxies, is concentrated in the three X-ray
clusters, and we obtain mean mass-to-light ratios for the clusters of M/L_B
\simeq 260 h. Cross-correlation of the measured mass surface density with that
predicted from the early type galaxy distribution shows a strong peak at zero
lag (significant at the \simeq 9-sigma level), and that at separations \gsim
200 h^{-1}$kpc the early galaxies trace the mass very accurately. This
conclusion is supported by cross-correlation in Fourier space; we see little
evidence for any variation of M/L or `bias' with scale, and from the longest

We find that the source parameters determining the radio luminosity of FRII

the jet power to be correlated either with the life time of the source or with
the shape of the density distribution of the source environment. The latter
case is consistent with the observed tendency of the most luminous radio
sources at high redshift to be located in richer and more extended environments
than their low redshift counterparts. We also find evidence for a class of FRII
sources distinctly different from the main population. These sources are
extremely old and/or are located in very underdense environments. The
luminosity function of FRII sources resulting from the model is in good
agreement with previous results for high luminosity sources. The apparent

of the high flux limit of the used comparison sample. The cosmological

properties of the Ferromagnetic Kondo model is analyzed using computational
techniques. The Hamiltonian studied here is defined on a chain using localized
S=1/2 spins, and one orbital per site. Special emphasis is given to the
influence of the Coulomb repulsion on the regions of phase separation recently
discovered in this family of models, as well as on the double-exchange-induced
ferromagnetic ground state. When phase separation dominates at V=0, the Coulomb
interaction breaks the large domains of the two competing phases into small
``islands'' of one phase embedded into the other. This is in agreement with
several experimental results, as discussed in the text. Vestiges of the
original phase separation regime are found in the spin structure-factor as
incommensurate peaks, even at large values of V. In the ferromagnetic regime
close to density $n=0.5$, the Coulomb interaction induces tendencies to charge
ordering without altering the fully polarized character of the state. This
regime of ``charge- ordered ferromagnetism'' may be related with experimental
observations of a similar phase by C. H. Chen and S-W. Cheong (Phys. Rev. Lett.
76, 4042 (1996)). Our results reinforce the recently introduction notion (see
e.g., S. Yunoki et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 845 (1998)) that in realistic
models for manganites analyzed with unbiased many-body techniques, the ground
state properties arise from a competition between ferromagnetism and
phase-separation/charge-ordering tendencies.

Relativity and Yang-Mills Theory"" by Barrett, J. W. (Int.J.Theor.Phys., vol.30,
No.9, 1991). Its main goal is to provide an alternative proof of this part of
the reconstruction theorem which concerns the existence of a connection. A
construction of connection 1-form is presented. The formula expressing the
local coefficients of connection in terms of the holonomy map is obtained as an
immediate consequence of that construction. Thus the derived formula coincides
with that used in ""On Loop Space Formulation of Gauge Theories"" by Chan, H.-M.,
Scharbach, P. and Tsou S.T. (Ann.Phys., vol.167, 454-472, 1986). The
reconstruction and representation theorems form a generalization of the fact
that the pointed configuration space of the classical Yang-Mills theory is
equivalent to the set of all holonomy maps. The point of this generalization is
that there is a one-to-one correspondence not only between the holonomy maps
and the orbits in the space of connections, but also between all maps from the
loop space on $M$ to group $G$ fulfilling some axioms and all possible
equivalence classes of $P(M,G)$ bundles with connection, where the equivalence
relation is defined by bundle isomorphism in a natural way.

branching. Here `catalytic' means that branching of the reactant $X$ is only
possible in the presence of some catalyst. Our intrinsic example of a catalyst
is a stable random measure $\Gamma $ on $R$ of index $0< gamma <1$.
Consequently, here the catalyst is located in a countable dense subset of $R$.
Starting with a finite reactant mass $X_0$ supported by a compact set, $X$ is
shown to die in finite time. Our probabilistic argument uses the idea of good
and bad historical paths of reactant `particles' during time periods
$[T_{n},T_{n+1})$. Good paths have a significant collision local time with the
catalyst, and extinction can be shown by individual time change according to
the collision local time and a comparison with Feller's branching diffusion. On
the other hand, the remaining bad paths are shown to have a small expected mass
at time $T_{n+1}$ which can be controlled by the hitting probability of point
catalysts and the collision local time spent on them.

k-torsionless modules, and k-th syzygies.
  Essentially everything in these notes can be found, in one form or another,
in the memoir ""Stable module theory"" by M. Auslander and M. Bridger (Mem.
A.M.S., no. 94, 1969). The only difference is in presentation. In the
Auslander-Bridger memoir many of the results are proved in the most general
setting, e.g. over possibly non-commutative, non-Noetherian rings. The
techniques used are quite abstract and unfamiliar to many commutative
algebraists. Much space is devoted to the theory of satellites of functors
which are exact only in the middle, etc. While such a degree of generality has
many advantages, it does make the memoir difficult to read for the non-expert.
My goal in writing these notes was to develop the theory in the context of
commutative Noetherian rings, and to show that, in this important special case,
the theory is fairly elementary and easy to build. As a practical matter, then,
I wrote the notes using Matsumura's ""Commutative ring theory"" as the only
pre-requisite; and indeed, my hope is that these notes can be read just like an
extra chapter in Matsumura's book.

electromagnetic signal velocity also in the presence of barriers and
