galaxies has been much debated. It may well be related to other fundamental
questions, such as the mechanism which heats and virializes the intracluster
medium (ICM), and the frequency at which the ICM is shocked. There is now
compelling evidence both from the cluster soft excess (CSE) and the `hard-tail'
emissions at energies above 10 keV, that many clusters are luminous sources of
inverse-Compton (IC) emission. This is the first direct measurement of cluster
CR: the technique is free from our uncertainties in the ICM magnetic field, and
is not limited to the small subset of clusters which exhibit radio halos. The
CSE emitting electrons fall within a crucial decade of energy where they have
the least spectral evolution, and where most of the CR pressure resides.
However their survival times do not date them back to the relic CR population.
By using the CSE data of the Coma cluster, we demonstrate that the CR are
energetically as important as the thermal ICM: the two components are in
pressure equiparition. Thus, contrary to previous expectations, CR are a
dominant component of the ICM, and their origin and effects should be explored.
The best-fit CR spectral index is in agreement with the Galactic value.

and dereddened colors of the giant branches are consistent with published
[Fe/H] estimates that rank the clusters (Pal 3, Eridanus, Pal 4) in order of
increasing metallicity, with all three falling near or between the abundance
values of the classic nearby halo clusters M3 and M5. Differential fits of
their color-magnitude diagrams are made to each other and to M3 and M5 for

differ from the nearby clusters in a way that is consistent with their being
younger by $\sim 1.5 - 2 $Gyr, if we have correctly estimated the clusters'

smaller ($\ltsim 1 $Gyr) if either [Fe/H] or [$\alpha$/Fe] for the outer-halo

molecular clouds take much longer than a free-fall time to form stars. It has
classically been thought that supersonic hydrodynamical turbulence would
dissipate its energy quickly, but that the introduction of strong magnetic
fields could maintain these motions. In a previous paper it has been shown,
however, that isothermal, compressible, MHD and hydrodynamical turbulence decay
at virtually the same rate, requiring that constant driving occur to maintain
the observed turbulence. In this paper direct numerical computations of
uniformly driven turbulence with the ZEUS astrophysical MHD code are used to
derive the absolute value of energy dissipation as a function of the driving
wavelength and amplitude. The ratio of the formal decay time of turbulence
E_{kin}/\dot{E}_{kin} to the free-fall time of the gas can then be derived as a
function of the ratio of driving wavelength to Jeans wavelength and rms Mach
number, and shown to be most likely far less than unity, again showing that
turbulence in molecular clouds must be constantly and strongly driven.

damping, and phase mixing as (manifestations of) a single phenomenon. This
approach embraces the fact that the collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE), the
basic object of the theory, is an infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian system, with
the distribution function f playing the role of the fundamental dynamical
variable, and that, interpreted appropriately, an evolution described by the
{\it CBE} is no different fundamentally from an evolution described by any
other Hamiltonian system. Equilibrium solutions correspond to extremal points
of the Hamiltonian subject to the constraints associated with Liouville's
Theorem. Stable equilibria correspond to energy minima. The evolution of a
system out of equilibrium involves (in general nonlinear) phase space
oscillations which may -- or may not -- interfere destructively so as to damp

towards these clouds and searching for sodium doublet absorption at the clouds'

tightly constrains the position of the Draco Cloud. We briefly describe our

our observational data presented in Paper 3. Based on our intended CCD
field-of-view (6.5 by 6.5 arcmins) and a 1-sigma detection limit of 26 mags per

determined over a wide range of absolute magnitude (-23 < M_{R} < -16)

  (a) the cluster has an Abell richness 1.5 or greater,

are used, coupled with measurements of the central velocity dispersion found in
the literature, to determine the H band Fundamental Plane (FP) relation of this
cluster. The same procedure is applied to previously available photometric data
in the B, V, r, I, and K bands, to perform a multi-wavelength study of the FP.
Because systematic uncertainties in the value of the FP parameters are
introduced both by the choice of the fitting algorithm, and by the presence of
statistical biases connected with the sample selection procedure, we emphasize
the importance of deriving the FP parameters in the six photometric bands using
an identical fitting algorithm, and appropriate corrections to eliminate the
effects of sample incompleteness. We find that the FP mu_e coefficient is
stable with wavelength, while the sigma coefficient increases significantly
with increasing wavelength, in agreement with an earlier result presented by
Pahre & Djorgovski. The slope of the FP relation, although changing with
wavelength, never approaches the virial theorem expectation. We also find that
the magnitude of the slope change can be entirely explained by the presence of
the well known relation between color and magnitude among early-type galaxies.
We conclude that the tilt of the Fundamental Plane is significant, and must be
due to some form of broken homology among early-type galaxies, while its
wavelength dependence derives from whatever mechanism (currently the preferred
one is the existence of a mass-metal content sequence) produces the
color-magnitude relation in those galaxies.

blackbody disk/power-law model. The source is observed in the very high,
high/soft, and low/hard outburst states. During the very high state, the source
exhibits intense hard flares on time scales of hours to days which are
correlated with changes in both the fitted temperature and radius of the inner
accretion disk. During the high/soft state, the spectrum is dominated by the
soft thermal emission from the accretion disk with spectral parameters that
suggest approximately constant inner disk radius and temperature. We find that
a tight relationship exists between the observed inner radius of the disk and
the flux in the power-law component. During intense hard flares, the inner disk
radius is observed to decrease by as much as a factor of three on a time scale
of days. The apparent decrease of the inner disk radius observed during the
flares may be due to the failure of the multicolor disk model caused by a
steepening of the radial temperature profile in the disk coupled with increased
spectral hardening and not physical changes of the inner disk radius. Assuming
that our spectral model is valid during periods of weak power-law emission, our
most likely value for the inner disk radius implies a* < 0.7. Such a low value
for the black hole angular momentum is inconsistent with the relativistic frame

$\epsilon_h$ for each pair of successive chain segments which are not

$x=\frac{\epsilon_h}{\epsilon_v}$. We find two different qualitative behaviors,
on varying $t$. For small values of $x$ the system undergoes a $\theta$
collapse from an extended coil to a compact globule; subsequently, on
decreasing further $t$, there is a first order transition to an anisotropic

where only elastic deformations occur between asperities at the contact surface
between the slider block and the substrate. In this regime, solid friction is
due to the generation of vibrational radiations which are subsequently damped
out. We study periodic commensurate and incommensurate asperities and various
types of disordered surfaces. We report the evidence of a transition from zero
(or non-measurable $\mu < 0.001$) friction to a finite friction as the normal
pressure increases above about $10^6~Pa$. For larger normal pressures (up to
$10^9~Pa$), we find a remarkably universal value for the friction coefficient
$\mu \approx 0.06$, which is independent of the internal dissipation strength
over three order of magnitudes, and independent of the detailled nature of the
slider block-substrate interactions. We find that disorder may either decrease
or increase $\mu$ due to the competition between two effects: disorder detunes
the coherent vibrations of the asperties that occur in the periodic case,
leading to weaker acoustic radiation and thus weaker damping. On the other
hand, large disorder leads to stronger vibration amplitudes at local asperities
and thus stronger damping. Our simulations have confirmed the existence of
jumps over steps or asperities of the slider blocks occurring at the largest
velocities studied ($10~m/s$). These jumps lead to chaotic motions similar to
the bouncing-ball problem. We find a velocity strengthening with a doubling of
the friction coefficient as the velocity increases from $1~m/s$ to $10~m/s$.

many-body process in which all nucleons participate by diagonalizing the
nuclear Hamiltonian within a selected set of tilted and non-tilted cranking
quasiparticle states. This microscopic approach is able to restore the broken
D2 symmetry and reproduce the quantum fluctuations between symmetry- related

attempts to `derive' three-Coulomb particle wave functions to be used in all of
configuration space which are solutions of the Schroedinger equation, though
not everywhere but at least in one or preferably all of the asymptotic regions.
Their practical application in approximate calculations of ionisation and
breakup processes is pointed out. The asymptotic three-charged particle wave
functions find further use in investigations of asymptotic and analytic
properties of matrix elements of the three-body Coulomb resolvent. An important
example is the nonperturbative derivation, valid for all energies, of the
large-distance behaviour of the optical potential. In the second part I
describe renewed attempts to establish the few-body approach as a valuable tool
for calculating (energetic) atomic collision processes. At the end I briefly

influenced strongly by the Fermi-surface distortion (FSD) effect. The
relaxation of collective motion and the width of giant multipole resonances in
hot nuclei show a saturated behaviour with temperature caused by the memory
effect in the collision integral. The development of the bulk and surface
instabilities of the nuclear Fermi-liquid is sensitive to the dynamic effects
such as the FSD and the relaxation processes. The instability growth rate is
reduced due to the FSD effect and depends on the multipolarity of the particle
density and surface fluctuations.
