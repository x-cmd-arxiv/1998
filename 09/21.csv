clusters. Maps of the emission from the J = 1-> O transitions of C18O, DCO+,
N2H+, and H13CO+, as well as the J = 2 -> 1 and J = 3 -> 2 transitions of CS,
were obtained for each core. Core densities are determined via a large velocity
gradient analysis with values typically 10^5 cm^-3. With the use of
observations to constrain variables in the chemical calculations we derive
electron fractions for our overall sample of 5 cores directly associated with
star formation and 2 apparently starless cores. The electron abundances are
found to lie within a small range, -6.9 < log10(x_e) < -7.3, and are consistent
with previous work. We find no difference in the amount of ionization fraction
between cores with and without associated star formation activity, nor is any
difference found in electron abundances between the edge and center of the
emission region. Thus our models are in agreement with the standard picture of
cosmic rays as the primary source of ionization for molecular ions. With the
addition of previously determined electron abundances for low mass cores, and
even more massive cores associated with O and B clusters, we systematically
examine the ionization fraction as a function of star formation activity. This
analysis demonstrates that the most massive sources stand out as having the
lowest electron abundances (x_e < 10^-8).

haloes predicted by viable variants of hierarchical cold dark matter dominated
cosmological models for lifetimes $t_Q$ of the optically bright phase of QSOs
in the range $10^{6}$ to $10^{8}$ yr. There is a strong correlation between
$t_Q$ and the required degree of non-linearity in the relation between black
hole and host halo mass. Such a non-linear relation is motivated by suggesting
that the mass of supermassive black holes may be limited by the back-reaction
of the emitted energy on the accretion flow in a self-gravitating disc. This
would imply a relation of black hole to halo mass of the form $M_{\rm bh}
\propto v_{\rm halo}^5 \propto M_{\rm halo}^{5/3}$ and a typical duration of
the optically bright QSO phase of the order of the Salpeter time, $\sim 10^{7}$
yr. The high integrated local mass density of black holes inferred from recent
kinematic determinations of black hole masses in nearby galaxies seem to
indicate that the overall efficiency of supermassive black holes for producing
blue light is lower than was previously assumed. We discuss three possible
accretion modes with low optical emission efficiency: (i) accretion well above
the Eddington rate, (ii) accretion obscured by dust, and (iii) accretion below
the critical rate leading to an advection dominated accretion flow lasting for
a Hubble time. We further argue that accretion with low optical efficiency

investigated only $R$, it remains uncertain whether the luminous starburst

propose a new observational test to examine this problem. Our new test is to
compare far-infrared luminosities [$L$(FIR)] with those of $^{12}$CO and
$^{13}CO [L(^{12}CO)$ and $L(^{13}CO)$, respectively]. It is shown that there
is a very tight correlation between $L(^{12}CO)$ and L(FIR), as found in many
previous studies. However, we find that the $^{13}$CO luminosities of the
high-R galaxies are lower by a factor of three on the average than those
expected from the correlation for the remaining galaxies with ordinary $R$
values. Therefore, we conclude that the observed high $R$ values for the
luminous starburst galaxies are attributed to their lower $^{13}$CO line
intensities.

non-selfgravitating protostellar accretion disc with an embedded, Jupiter sized
protoplanet on a circular orbit are solved. To simulate possible accretion of
mass onto the protoplanet we continually remove mass from the interior of the
planet's Roche lobe which is monitored. Firstly, it is shown that consistent
results independent on numerical issues (such as boundary or initial
conditions, artificial viscosity or resolution) can be obtained. Then, a
detailed parameter study delineates the influence of the disc viscosity and
pressure on the magnitude of the accretion rate.
  We find that, even after the formation of a gap in the disc, the planet is
still able to accrete more mass from the disc. This accretion occurs from
regions of the disc which are radially exterior and interior to the planet's
orbital radius. The rate depends on the magnitude of the viscosity and vertical
thickness of the disc. For a disc viscosity alpha=10^{-3} and vertical
thickness H/r=0.05 we estimate the time scale for the accumulation of one
Jupiter mass to be of order hundred thousand years. For a larger(smaller)
viscosity and disc thickness this accretion rate is increasing(decreasing).
  For a very small viscosity (alpha < 5 10^{-4}) the mass accretion rate
through the gap onto the planet is markedly reduced, and the corresponding
accretion time scale becomes larger than the viscous evolution time of the
disc.

``soft'' component with kT ~ 0.9 keV, and a ``hard'' component with kT ~ 6 keV
absorbed by a column density of ~ 1.2 x10**22 cm-2. For the first time in this

that most of the hard X-ray emission is thermal in origin, and constrains the
iron abundances of this component to be ~0.25 of solar. Other lines clearly
detected are Si, S and Fe L/Ne, in agreement with previous ASCA results. We

unicity of the models in relation to their analyticity at the black hole

study the role played by the presence/lack of discrete reflection symmetries
about equatorial planes in the chaotic behavior of the orbits, which is to be
contrasted with the almost universal acceptance of reflection symmetries as
default assumptions in galactic modeling. We also compare the related effects
if we change a true central black hole by a Newtonian central mass. The
numerical findings are: 1- The breakdown of the reflection symmetry about the
equatorial plane in both Newtonian and relativistic core-shell models does i)
enhance in a significant way the chaoticity of orbits in reflection symmetric
oblate shell models and ii) inhibit significantly also the occurrence of chaos
in reflection symmetric prolate shell models. In particular, in the prolate
case the lack of the reflection symmetry provides the phase space with a robust
family of regular orbits that is otherwise not found at higher energies. 2- The
relative extents of the chaotic regions in the relativistic cases (i. e. with a
true central black hole) are significantly larger than in the corresponding
Newtonian ones (which have just a $-1/r$ central potential).

in magnetic field, generating a rational fraction of the magnetic flux (\phi=
p/q) in each hexagonal plaquette of the graphite plane, behaves like a
zero-field edge state with q internal degrees of freedom. The orbital
diamagnetic susceptibility strongly depends on the edge shapes. The reason is
found in the analysis of the ring currents, which are very sensitive to the
lattice topology near the edge. Moreover, the orbital diamagnetic
susceptibility is scaled as a function of the temperature, Fermi energy and
ribbon width. Because the edge states lead to a sharp peak in the density of
states at the Fermi level, the graphite ribbons with zigzag edges show
Curie-like temperature dependence of the Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility.

An estimate of this contribution shows that it is greater than the one arising
from the nematic-substrate interaction. Moreover, it is also shown that the
surface energy determined in this way presents a non-monotonic behavior with
the temperature.

the ground state of the repulsive three-band Hubbard model. To make contact
with Cooper theory and with earlier Hubbard model cluster studies, we first use
a perturbative canonical transformation, to generate a two-body Hamiltonian.
Then, we extend the results to all orders. The approach is exact in principle,
and we obtain a close analytic expression including explicitly the effects of
all virtual transitions to 4-body intermediate states. Our scheme naturally
lends itself to embody off-site, inter-planar, phonon-mediated and other
interactions which are not considered in the Hubbard model but may well be
important. The result depends qualitatively on the symmetry of the two-hole
state: $^{1}B_{2}$ and $ ^{1}A_{2}$ pairs are special, because the bare holes
do not interact by the on-site repulsion (W=0 pairs). The effective interaction
in these channels is attractive and leads to a Cooper-like instability of the
Fermi liquid; however $W_{eff}$ is repulsive for Triplet pairs. Bound two-hole
states of the same nature were reported earlier in small cluster calculations
by exact diagonalisation methods; only symmetric clusters are good models of
the plane. Once $W_{eff}$ is known, the pair eigenfunction is determined by an
integral equation. We present numerical estimates of the binding energy
$|\Delta|$ of the pairs, which is in the physically interesting range of tens
of meV if unscreened on-site repulsion parameters are used.

argued. We show that all the present difficulties of the minimal supersymmetric
SU(5) model can successfully be overcome with a new renormalizable
reflection-invariant superpotential with two-adjoint scalars, one of which is
interpreted as a massive string mode essentially decoupled from the low-energy
particle spectra. This superpotential is proved to properly fix a mass ratio of
the basic adjoint scalar moduli, while its gauge-type reflection symmetry
essentially protects the model from gravitational smearing. The significant
heavy threshold effect related with the generic mass splitting of adjoint
moduli is shown to alter appropriately the running of gauge couplings towards
the realistic string-scale grand unification. Furthermore, the extension of the
superpotential to some SU(N) GUTs gives rise to, among many degenerate vacua,
the missing VEV vacuum configuration for the basic adjoint scalar, thus
providing a further clue to a doublet-triplet splitting problem, on the one
hand, and a family symmetry $SU(N-5)_F$ for quarks and leptons, on the other.

to the original series. This transforms the original monotone series into an
alternating series. In the second step, the convergence of the transformed
series is accelerated with the help of suitable nonlinear sequence
transformations that are known to be particularly powerful for alternating
series. Some theoretical aspects of our approach are discussed. The efficiency,
numerical stability, and wide applicability of the combined
nonlinear-condensation transformation is illustrated by a number of examples.
We discuss the evaluation of special functions close to or on the boundary of
the circle of convergence, even in the vicinity of singularities. We also
consider a series of products of spherical Bessel functions, which serves as a
model for partial wave expansions occurring in quantum electrodynamic bound
state calculations.

oscillating magnetic field. In this case the $\pi$-kink solution we have
introduced corresponds to the uniform ``true'' domain wall motion, since the
magnetization directions on opposite sides of the wall are anti-parallel. In
contrast to previous work, no additional anisotropy is required to obtain a
true domain wall. Numerical simulations showed good qualitative agreement with

implies the existence of a one-parameter family of $\pi$-kink solutions in the
reduced system. In the dissipative case of the ac driven sine-Gordon systems,
corresponding to Josephson junctions, the velocity is selected by the balance
between the perturbations. The results are derived from a perturbation analysis

in Physical Review Letters, Volume 100, Issue 9, March 7, 2008, in an article
entitled ""Anomalous Orbital-Energy Changes Observed during Spacecraft Flybys of
Earth"".
  The data indicate unaccounted for changes in spacecraft speed, both increases
and decreases, for six different spacecraft involved in Earth flybys from
December 8, 1990 to August 2, 2005. The article states that, ""All ... potential
sources of systematic error .... [have been] modeled. None can account for the
observed anomalies.... Like the Pioneer anomaly ... the Earth flybys anomaly is
a real effect .... Its source is unknown.""
  In the present article it is shown that the Earth flybys anomaly would be
caused by a very small acceleration [in addition to that of natural
gravitation], centrally directed and independent of distance, the same effect
as that which the Pioneer anomaly exhibits. How that effect operates to produce
the observed results is analyzed. A cause of the centrally directed
accelerations is presented.

detected at point (x_2,t_2) does not travel along a definite path between the
two points. This conclusion arises essentially from the analysis of the
two-slit experiment, which implicitly assumes (as in the demonstration of the
EPR paradox) that a property we will call Independence Property holds. This
paper shows that this assumption is not indispensable. Abandoning the
assumption allows to develop an ontology where particle motion is described by
classical paths and quantum phenomena are interpreted as a manifestation of a
contingent law, i.e., of a law deriving from the boundary conditions of the
universe, such as the second law of thermodynamics. The paper also proposes an
equation having a typical quantum-like structure to represent the contingent
laws of the universe.
