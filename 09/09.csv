galaxy NGC4151, which are described in a companion paper, are used together
with a compilation of UV to IR narrow emission line data to determine the
spectral shape of the obscured extreme-UV continuum that photoionizes the
narrow line emitting gas in the active galactic nucleus. We present a new
method to determine the best fitting photoionizing continuum and emission line
cloud model from a heterogeneous set of emission line data.
  For NGC4151, we find a best-fit model that reproduces the observed line
fluxes to within a factor of 2 on average, and which is consistent with the
observed geometry of the optical Narrow Line Region (NLR). Our model consists
of a clumpy, optically thick (ionization bounded) gas distribution, with a
hydrogen gas density of ~1000 cm^-3 and a volume filling factor of 6.5*10^-4.
  Our best fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) falls sharply beyond the
Lyman limit and then rises sharply again towards 100 eV. In particular, it does
not display a `Big Blue Bump' signature of a hot accretion disk. We find that
this SED, which best reproduces the NLR line emission on the 100--500 pc scale,
does not have enough UV photons to produce the observed BLR recombination
emission from the inner 1 pc. This suggests that the BLR is photoionized by the
intrinsic continuum source, which does have a strong UV component (perhaps a
Big Blue Bump), but that this UV component is absorbed by material located
between the NLR and BLR. Our analysis suggests that the absorber consists of
\~5*10^19 cm^-2 of neutral hydrogen. Such an absorber was independently
detected by UV absorption lines (Kriss et al. 1992, 1995).

space moments through order 4 and (2) binned reduced distributions f(Z_a,Z_b,t)

chaotic orbits in 2-D systems not stuck near islands by cantori, the moments
evolve exponentially: Quantities like the dispersion in p_x, which start small
and eventually asymptote towards a larger value, initially grow exponentially
in time at a rate comparable to the largest short time Lyapunov exponent.
Quantities like |<p_x>|, that can start large but eventually asymptote towards
zero, decrease exponentially. With respect to a discrete L^p norm, reduced
distributions f(t) generated from successive decay exponentially towards a
near-invariant f_{niv}, although a plot of Df(t)=||f(t)-f_{niv}|| can exhibit
considerable structure. Regular ensembles behave very differently, both moments
and Df evolving in a fashion better represented by a power law time dependence.
``Confined'' chaotic orbits, initially stuck near regular islands because of
cantori, exhibit an intermediate behaviour. The behaviour of ensembles evolved
in 3-D potentials is qualitatively similar, except that, in this case, it is
relatively likely to find one direction in configuration space which is ``less
chaotic'' than the other two, so that quantities like L_{ab} depend more
sensitively on which phase space variables one tracks.

virialized gaseous halos around galaxies at high redshifts. A small fraction of
the light emitted by any high-redshift quasar is therefore expected to scatter
off the free electrons in the halo of its host galaxy. The broadening of the
scattered emission lines of the quasar can be used to measure the temperature
of these electrons. For gas in virial equilibrium, the velocity width of the
scattered line profile is larger by a factor of (m_p/m_e)^{1/2}=43 than the
velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and reaches >10,000 km/s for the massive
galaxies and groups in which bright quasars reside. In these systems, the
scattered width exceeds the intrinsic width of the quasar lines and hence can
be used to measure the virial temperature of the quasar host. The high degree
of polarization of the scattered radiation can help filter out the extended
scattered light from the central emission by the quasar and its host galaxy.
The signal-to-noise ratio of the spectral broadening can be enhanced by
matching the full spectrum of the scattered radiation to a template of the
unscattered quasar spectrum. Although the central fuzz around low-redshift
quasars is dominated by starlight, the fuzz around high-redshift quasars might
be dominated by scattering before galaxies have converted most of their gas

Functions (IMFs) as ionizing sources. Additional models were computed with more
recent non-LTE stellar atmospheres. We use the radiation softness parameter
eta' of Vilchez and Pagel to test for a metallicity dependence of the effective
temperatures of the ionizing stars. Our results are consistent with a
significant decrease in mean stellar temperatures of the ionizing stars with
increasing metallicity. The magnitude of the effect, combined with the behavior
of the HeI 5876/Hbeta ratio, suggest a smaller upper mass limit for star
formation at abundances higher than solar, even when considering the effects of
metallicity on stellar evolution and atmospheric line blanketing. However, the
exact magnitudes of the stellar temperature and IMF variations are dependent on
the choice of stellar atmosphere and evolution models used, as well as on
uncertainties in the nebular abundance scale at high metallicities. Our results
also constrain the systematic behavior of the ionization parameter and the N/O
ratio in extragalactic H II regions. The observed spectral sequences are
inconsistent with current stellar evolution models which predict a luminous,
hot W-R stellar population in evolved H II regions older than 2-3 Myr. This

similar to the Pleiades, contradicting predictions from standard stellar
evolution models, in which convective pre-main sequence (PMS) Li depletion
should increase rapidly with metallicity. If the high metallicity of Blanco 1
is subsequently confirmed, our observations imply (1) that a currently unknown
mechanism severely inhibits PMS Li depletion, (2) that additional non-standard

the magnetization switches through random nucleation and subsequent growth of
many droplets of spins aligned with the applied field. Using a time-dependent
extension of the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (KJMA) theory of metastable
decay, we analyze the statistical properties of the hysteresis-loop area and
the correlation between the magnetization and the applied field. This analysis
enables us to accurately predict the results of extensive Monte Carlo

asymptotic, logarithmic dependence on the product of the amplitude and the
frequency of the applied field. This may explain the inconsistent exponent
estimates reported in previous attempts to fit experimental and numerical data
for the low-frequency behavior of this quantity to a power law. At higher
frequencies we observe a dynamic phase transition. Applying standard
finite-size scaling techniques from the theory of second-order equilibrium
phase transitions to this nonequilibrium phase transition, we obtain estimates
for the transition frequency and the critical exponents (beta/nu \approx 0.11,
gamma/nu \approx 1.84 and nu \approx 1.1). In addition to their significance
for the interpretation of recent experiments on switching in ferromagnetic and

which focuses on the strong-coupling regime, and the Edwards-Hertz approach
(EHA) which correctly recovers the weak-coupling regime. Investigating the
high-energy expansion of the EHA self-energy, it turns out that the EHA
reproduces the first three exactly known moments of the spectral density only.
This may be insufficient for the investigation of spontaneous magnetism. The
analysis of the high-energy behavior of the CPA self-consistency equation
allows for a new interpretation of the MAA: The MAA is the only (two-component)
alloy-analogy that correctly takes into account the first four moments of the
spectral density. For small U, however, the MAA does not reproduce Fermi-liquid
properties. The defects of the MAA as well as of the EHA are avoided in the new
approach. We discuss the prospects of the theory and present numerical results

high-energy behavior of the self-energy is proved to be a decisive ingredient

To continue the analogy with atoms, two quantum dots can be connected to form
an 'artificial molecule'. Depending on the strength of the inter-dot coupling,
the two dots can have an ionic binding (i.e. electrons are localized on the
individual dots) or a covalent binding (i.e. electrons are delocalized over
both dots). The covalent binding leads to a bonding and an anti-bonding state
with an energy splitting proportional to the tunnel coupling. In the dc current
response to microwave excitation we observe a transition from an ionic bonding

demonstrates controllable quantum coherence in single electron devices.

For the firststep the real scalar field is considered as the matter field and
the spacetime is assumed to be static spherically symmetric. If the scalar
field is massless or has a convex potential such as a mass term, it is proved
that there is no regular black hole solution. For a general positive potential,
we search for black hole solutions which support the scalar field with a double
well potential, and find them by numerical calculations. The existence of such
solutions depends on the values of the vacuum expectation value and the
self-coupling constant of the scalar field. When we take the zero horizon
radius limit, the solution becomes a boson star like solution which we found
before. However new solutions are found to be unstable against the linear
perturbation. As a result we can conclude that the no-scalar hair conjecture

would expect two neighbouring states with the mass difference of about 30-50

from discretizing PDEs. It is robust and, for the examples we studied, the
computational effort scales linearly with the number of equations. The
algorithm is based on a wavelength decomposition that combines conjugate
gradient, multi-scaling and iterative splitting methods into a single approach.
On the surface, the algorithm is a simple preconditioned conjugate gradient
with all the sophistication of the algorithm in the choice of the
preconditioning matrix. The preconditioner is a very good approximate inverse
of the linear operator. It is constructed from the inverse of the coarse
grained linear operator and from smoothing operators that are based on an
operator splitting on the fine grid. The coarse graining captures the long
wavelength behavior of the inverse operator while the smoothing operator
captures the short wavelength behavior. The conjugate gradient iteration
accounts for the coupling between long and short wavelengths. The coarse
grained operator corresponds to a lowerresolution approximation to the PDEs.
While the coarse grained inverse is not known explicitly, the algorithm only
requires that the preconditioner can be a applied to a vector. The coarse
inverse applied to a vector can be obtained as the solution of another
preconditioned conjugate gradient solver that applies the same algorithm to the
smaller problem. Thus, the method is naturally recursive. The recursion ends
when the matrix is sufficiently small for a solution to be obtained efficiently
with a standard solver. We have tested our solver on the porous flow equation.
On a workstation we have solved problems on grids ranging in dimension from
$10^3$ to $10^6$, and found that the linear scaling holds.

  improved throughout thanks to reviewers' comments","ACM Comput.Surveys 32:300-335,2000",,"FXPAL-TR-98-044","quant-ph cs.GL",,"  Richard Feynman's observation that quantum mechanical effects could not be
simulated efficiently on a computer led to speculation that computation in
general could be done more efficiently if it used quantum effects. This
speculation appeared justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time
quantum algorithm for factoring integers.
  In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the
size of the system which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism
could lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible
classically. The catch is that accessing the results, which requires
measurement, proves tricky and requires new non-traditional programming
techniques.
  The aim of this paper is to guide computer scientists and other
non-physicists through the conceptual and notational barriers that separate
quantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic principles of
quantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers comes from
and why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography,
teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to harnessing the power of
quantum parallelism are explained, including Shor's algorithm, Grover's
algorithm, and Hogg's algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of quantum
error correction.
