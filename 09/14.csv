to probe cosmologically interesting muon and/or tauon neutrino masses. This is
because matter enhanced neutrino oscillations can lead to an anomalously hot
nu_e spectrum, and thus to enhanced charged current cross sections in
terrestrial detectors. Two recently proposed supernova neutrino observatories,
OMNIS and LAND, will detect neutrons spalled from target nuclei by neutral and
charged current neutrino interactions. As this signal is not flavor specific,
it is not immediately clear whether a convincing neutrino oscillation signal
can be extracted from such experiments. To address this issue we examine the
responses of a series of possible light and heavy mass targets, 9Be, 23Na,
35Cl, and 208Pb. We find that strategies for detecting oscillations which use
only neutron count rates are problematic at best, even if cross sections are
determined by ancillary experiments. Plausible uncertainties in supernova
neutrino spectra tend to obscure rate enhancements due to oscillations.
However, in the case of 208Pb, a signal emerges that is largely flavor specific
and extraordinarily sensitive to the nu_e temperature, the emission of two
neutrons. This signal and its flavor specificity are associated with the
strength and location of the first-forbidden responses for neutral and charge
current reactions, aspects of the 208Pb neutrino cross section that have not
been discussed previously. Hadronic spin transfer experiments might be helpful
in confirming some of the nuclear structure physics underlying our conclusions.

on cosmological quantities such as Omega and Lambda, which determine how dark
matter halos form and evolve, and on the physical processes - cooling, star
formation and feedback - which drive the formation of galaxies within these
merging halos. In this paper, we combine dissipationless cosmological N-body
simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to study how
these two aspects interact. We focus on the differences in clustering predicted
for galaxies of differing luminosity, colour, morphology and star formation
rate and on what these differences can teach us about the galaxy formation
process. We show that a ""dip"" in the amplitude of galaxy correlations between
z=0 and z=1 can be an important diagnostic. Such a dip occurs in low-density
CDM models because structure forms early and dark matter halos of 10**12 solar
masses, containing galaxies with luminosities around L*, are unbiased tracers
of the dark matter over this redshift range; their clustering amplitude then
evolves similarly to that of the dark matter. At higher redshifts bright
galaxies become strongly biased and the clustering amplitude increases again.
In high density models, structure forms late and bias evolves more rapidly. As
a result, the clustering amplitude of L* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to
1. The strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. The dip is
weaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder colours, higher
luminosities and earlier morphological types. We explain why this is the case
and how it is related to the variation with redshift of the abundance and and
environment of the observed galaxies. Studies of clustering evolution as a
function of galaxy properties should place strong constraints on models.

been observed under conditions of quasi-two-dimensional growth. These
`S'-shaped patterns strongly break two-dimensional inversion symmetry; however
such broken symmetry occurs only at the level of overall morphology, as the
clusters are formed from achiral molecules with an achiral unit cell. Here we
describe a mechanism which gives rise to chiral growth morphologies without
invoking microscopic chirality. This mechanism involves trapped electrostatic
charge on the growing cluster, and the enhancement of growth in regions of
large electric field. We illustrate the mechanism with a tree growth model,
with a continuum model for the motion of the one-dimensional boundary, and with
microscopic Monte Carlo simulations. Our most dramatic results are found using
the continuum model, which strongly exhibits spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking, and in particular finned `S' shapes like those seen in the
experiments.

quanta on each link while preserving exact U(1) gauge invariance. The

the theory shows confinement and chiral symmetry breaking for all non-trivial

to the physics of compact U(1) gauge theory on the lattice emerges. In this

parametrized in terms of N_c(LL) and N_c(LR), the effective numbers of colors

electroweak penguin contributions account for about 85% (for N_c(LL)=2) of the

strongly on N_c(LR), (iii) the branching ratio of $B_s\to \eta\eta'$ is of

that MSW regions ($\Delta m^2\approx 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$, both small and large
mixing solutions) are stable up to very large levels of noise (P=0.7-0.8) but
they are acceptable from the point of view of antineutrino production only for
moderate levels of it ($P\approx 0.95$). For strong noise and reasonable
regular magnetic field, any parameter region $(\Delta m^2, \sin^2 2\theta)$ is
excluded. As a consequence, we are allowed to reverse the problem and to put
limits on r.m.s field strength and transition magnetic moments by demanding a
particle physics solution to the SNP under this scenario.

conjecture. Roughly put, this states that if two Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y
are mirror partners, then X and Y have special Lagrangian torus fibrations
which are dual to each other. Much work on this conjecture is necessarily of a
speculative nature, as in dimension 3 it is still a very difficult problem of
how to construct such fibrations. Nevertheless, assuming the existence of such
fibrations there are many things one can prove. This paper covers a number of
issues. First it applies results from the theory of completely integrable
hamiltonian systems to understand some aspects of the geometry of such
fibrations. From this, using reasonable regularity assumptions on the
fibrations, one can understand how the cohomology of dual fibrations are
related. We then study the question of how, given one such fibration, one would
put a symplectic and complex structure on the dual fibrations, generalising
work of Hitchin. While this question cannot be answered at this stage, these
results should give insight into the nature of the problem. We sum up these
ideas in a refined version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture.
  Finally, to give evidence for this conjecture, we prove it explicitly for K3
surfaces. One finds a construction of mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces which
does not require the use of Torelli theorems, and is much more differential
geometric in nature than previous constructions.

asymmetry of $K^+$ and $K^-$ mesons emitted at midrapidity in heavy ion
reactions, is investigated for beam energies of 1-2 A.GeV. It is found that the
squeeze-out signal is strongly affected by in-medium potentials of these
mesons. The repulsive $K^+$-nucleus potential gives rise to a pronounced
out-of-plane emission of $K^+$'s at midrapidity. With the $K^+$ potential we
reproduce well the experimental data of the $K^+$ azimuthal distribution. It is
found that the attractive $K^-$-nucleus potential cancels to a large extent the
influence of rescattering and reabsorption of the $K^-$ mesons on the
projectile and target residuals (i.e. shadowing). This results in an
azimuthally isotropic emission of the midrapidity $K^-$ mesons with transverse
momentum up to 0.8 GeV/c. Since it is well accepted that the shadowing alone
would lead to a significant out-of-plane preference of particle emission, in
particular at high transverse momenta, the disappearance of the out-of-plane
preference for the $K^-$ mesons can serve as an unambiguous signal of the
attractive $K^-$ potential. We also apply a covariant formalism of the kaon

at approx. 110 K, between a rigid phase and a phase involving isomerizations
between the different permutational isomers of the ground state structure. The
``liquid'' phase is completely established at approx. 220 K. For Na20, two
transitions are observed: the first, at approx. 110 K, is associated with
isomerization transitions between those permutational isomers of the ground
state structure which are obtained by interchanging the positions of the
surface-like atoms; the second, at approx. 160 K, involves a structural
transition from the ground state isomer to a new set of isomers with the
surface molten. The cluster is completely ``liquid'' at approx. 220 K.

(Schroedinger cat states) may be used as logical qubit encodings for the
correction of spontaneous emission errors. Spontaneous emission causes a bit
flip error which is easily corrected by a standard error correction circuit.
The method works arbitrarily well as the distance between the amplitudes of the
superposed coherent states increases.
