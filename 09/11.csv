environments of galaxies on 0.5 Mpc scale and properties of the luminous
components of galaxies. Our numerical simulations include effects of star
formation and supernova feedback in different cosmological scenarios: the
standard Cold Dark Matter model, the Broken Scale Invariance model (BSI), and a
model with cosmological constant (LCDM).
  In this paper, we concentrate on the effects of environment on colors and
morphologies of galaxies, on the star formation rate and on the relation
between the total luminosity of a galaxy and its circular velocity. We
demonstrate a statistically significant theoretical relationship between
morphology and environment. In particular, there is a strong tendency for
high-mass galaxies and for elliptical galaxies to form in denser environments,
in agreement with observations. We find that in models with denser environments
(CDM scenario) ~ 13 % of the galactic halos can be identified as field
ellipticals, according to their colors. In simulations with less clustering
(BSI and LCDM), the fraction of ellipticals is considerably lower (~ 2-3 %).
The strong sensitivity of morphological type to environment is rather
remarkable because our results are applicable to ``field'' galaxies and small
groups. If all galaxies in our simulations are included, we find a
statistically significant dependence of the galaxy luminosity - circular
velocity relation on dark matter overdensity within spheres of radius 0.5 Mpc,
for the CDM simulations. But if we remove ``elliptical'' galaxies from our
analysis to mimic the Tully-Fisher relation for spirals, then no dependence is
found in any model.

  accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/306739",,"astro-ph",,"  We have modeled the injection and acceleration of pickup ions at the solar
wind termination shock and investigated the parameters needed to produce the
observed Anomalous Cosmic Ray (ACR) fluxes. A non-linear Monte Carlo technique
was employed, which in effect solves the Boltzmann equation and is not
restricted to near-isotropic particle distribution functions. This technique
models the injection of thermal and pickup ions, the acceleration of these
ions, and the determination of the shock structure under the influence of the
accelerated ions. The essential effects of injection are treated in a mostly
self-consistent manner, including effects from shock obliquity, cross-field
diffusion, and pitch-angle scattering. Using recent determinations of pickup
ion densities, we are able to match the absolute flux of hydrogen in the ACRs
by assuming that pickup ion scattering mean free paths, at the termination
shock, are much less than an AU and that modestly strong cross-field diffusion
occurs. Simultaneously, we match the flux ratios He$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ or
O$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ to within a factor $\sim 5$. If the conditions of strong
scattering apply, no pre-termination-shock injection phase is required and the
injection and acceleration of pickup ions at the termination shock is totally
analogous to the injection and acceleration of ions at highly oblique
interplanetary shocks recently observed by the Ulysses spacecraft. The fact
that ACR fluxes can be modeled with standard shock assumptions suggests that
the much-discussed ""injection problem"" for highly oblique shocks stems from
incomplete (either mathematical or computer) modeling of these shocks rather
than from any actual difficulty shocks may have in injecting and accelerating
thermal or quasi-thermal particles.

in stellar or galaxian rest-frame optical spectra. The resulting
absorption-break redshift is z=5.34 (+- 0.01). Optical/near-IR photometry from
the HDF yields an exceptionally red (V(606)-I(814)) color, consistent with this

Tl-2201, the relative (compared to the B_1g) intensity of the A_1g scattering
component is suppressed. We suggest that the van Hove singularity is
responsible for the observed changes of Raman intensity and reduced gap value
with doping. Electronic Raman scattering in the normal state is discussed in
the context of the scattering from impurities and compared to the existing
infrared data. The scattering rate evaluated from the Raman measurements is
smaller for the overdoped samples, compared to the moderately overdoped

processes A -> A + A, A + A -> A, and A -> \emptyset. We study a hierarchy of
such DP processes for particle species A, B,..., unidirectionally coupled via
the reactions A -> B, ... (with rates \mu_{AB}, ...). When the DP critical
points at all levels coincide, multicritical behavior emerges, with density
exponents \beta_i which are markedly reduced at each hierarchy level i >= 2.
This scenario can be understood on the basis of the mean-field rate equations,
which yield \beta_i = 1/2^{i-1} at the multicritical point. We then include
fluctuations by using field-theoretic renormalization group techniques in d =

in logic programming is considered. These additions provide a logical basis for
scoping but they also raise new implementation problems. When universal and
existential quantifiers are permitted to appear in mixed order in goals, the
devices of logic variables and unification that are employed in solving
existential goals must be modified to ensure that constraints arising out of
the order of quantification are respected. Suitable modifications that are
based on attaching numerical tags to constants and variables and on using these
tags in unification are described. The resulting devices are amenable to an
efficient implementation and can, in fact, be assimilated easily into the usual
machinery of the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM). The provision of implications
in goals results in the possibility of program clauses being added to the
program for the purpose of solving specific subgoals. A naive scheme based on
asserting and retracting program clauses does not suffice for implementing such
additions for two reasons. First, it is necessary to also support the
resurrection of an earlier existing program in the face of backtracking.
Second, the possibility for implication goals to be surrounded by quantifiers
requires a consideration of the parameterization of program clauses by bindings
for their free variables. Devices for supporting these additional requirements
are described as also is the integration of these devices into the WAM. Further
extensions to the machine are outlined for handling higher-order additions to
the language. The ideas presented here are relevant to the implementation of
the higher-order logic programming language lambda Prolog.

R^{2n} in a physically meaningful way. Similar obstructions have been found for

to conjecture--and in some cases prove--generalized Groenewold-Van Hove

be consistently quantized. This requires a study of the structure of Poisson
