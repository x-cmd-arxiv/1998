accelerating phase space transport in time-independent Hamiltonian systems that
exhibit global stochasticity. Numerical experiments reveal that even very weak
non-Hamiltonian perturbations can dramatically increase the rate at which an
ensemble of orbits penetrates obstructions like cantori or Arnold webs, thus
accelerating the approach towards an invariant measure, i.e., a
near-microcanonical population of the accessible phase space region. An
investigation of first passage times through cantori leads to three
conclusions, namely: (i) that, at least for white noise, the detailed form of
the perturbation is unimportant, (ii) that the presence or absence of friction
is largely irrelevant, and (iii) that, overall, the amplitude of the response
to weak noise scales logarithmically in the amplitude of the noise.

with $K_s<20$ mag in a 2 by 7.3 arcmin field at J005325+1234 are reported.
Redshifts were successfully obtained for 163 of the 195 objects in the sample;
these redshifts lie in the range [0.173, 1.44] and have a median of 0.58
(excluding 24 Galactic stars). The redshift identifications are believed to be
almost complete for $z < 0.8$. Approximately half of the galaxies lie in five
narrow redshift features with local velocity dispersions of $ \sim 300 km/s$.
These narrow redshift ``peaks'' are primarily populated both by
absorption--line galaxies and the most luminous galaxies in the sample,
although the incidence of emission lines in the luminous galaxies increases
with redshift. The estimated dynamical masses of these redshift peaks, and the
sky distribution of the galaxies within them, appear similar to groups or poor
clusters of galaxies in the local universe at various stages of virialization.
Some groups of galaxies therefore form at epochs $z > 1.5$, and the galaxies in
such groups appear to be coeval and to show little sign of ongoing star
formation. The galaxies outside the redshift peaks are also clustered, albeit
more weakly, are less luminous and more frequently exhibit strong emission
lines. These ``isolated'' galaxies therefore appear, on average, to form stars
at later epochs than the strongly clustered galaxies. The galaxy SEDs derived
from our $UBVRIK$ photometry are also very closely correlated with the galaxy
spectral types and luminosities. These results have strong implications for the
analysis of redshift surveys at intermediate redshift.

parsecs surrounding Sgr A* we find emission which appears to be associated with
the circumnuclear disk (CND), both morphologically and kinematically. This
central emission is connected to a long, narrow 2 pc x 10 pc streamer of clumpy
molecular gas located towards the south, which appears to be carrying gas from
the nearby 20 km/s giant molecular cloud (GMC) to the circumnuclear region. We
find a velocity gradient along the streamer, with progressively higher
velocities as the gas approaches Sgr A*. The streamer stops at the location of
the CND, where the line width of the NH3 emission increases dramatically. This
may be the kinematic signature of accretion onto the CND. The ratio of the
NH3(2,2)/NH3(1,1) emission indicates that the gas is heated at the northern tip
of the streamer, located inside the eastern edge of the CND. The morphology,
kinematics and temperature gradients of the gas all indicate that the southern
streamer is located at the Galactic Center and is interacting with the
circumnuclear region.
