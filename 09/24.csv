  Mellier & S. Colombi (Gif-sur-Yvette: Editions Frontieres)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  I describe a general formalism for galaxy biasing (Dekel & Lahav 1998) and
its application to measurements of beta (=Omega^0.6/b), e.g. via direct
comparisons of light and mass and via redshift distortions. The linear and
deterministic relation g=b*d between the density fluctuation fields of galaxies
g and mass d is replaced by the conditional distribution P(g|d) of these as
random fields, smoothed at a given scale and at a given time. The mean biasing
and its nonlinearity are characterized by the conditional mean <g|d>=b(d)*d and
the local scatter by the conditional variance s_b^2(d). This scatter arises
from hidden effects on galaxy formation and from shot noise. For applications
involving second-order local moments, the biasing is defined by three natural
parameters: the slope b_h of the regression of g on d (replacing b), a
nonlinearity parameter b_t, and a scatter parameter s_b. The ratio of variances
b_v^2 and the correlation coefficient r mix these parameters. The nonlinearity
and scatter lead to underestimates of order b_t^2/b_h^2 and s_b^2/b_h^2 in the
different estimators of beta, which may partly explain the range of estimates.
Local stochasticity affects the redshift-distortion analysis only by limiting
the useful range of scales. In this range, for linear stochastic biasing, the
analysis reduces to Kaiser's formula for b_h (not b_v) independent of the
scatter. The distortion analysis is affected by nonlinearity but in a weak way.
Estimates of the nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on
simulations and toy models, and a new method for measuring them via
distribution functions is proposed.

from nonlinear Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the equatorial plane of the

circular wavefronts in this plane, expanding radially at speeds approximately
less than c/3. Instabilities could develop if there is sufficient velocity
shear between a faster-moving equatorial zone and a slower moving shocked
pulsar wind at higher latitudes. The development of shear could be related to
the existence of a neutral sheet -- with weak magnetic field -- in the
equatorial zone, and could also be related to a recent suggestion by Begelman
that the magnetic field in the Crab pulsar wind is much stronger than had been
thought. I show that plausible conditions could lead to the growth of
instabilities at the radii and speeds observed, and that their nonlinear
development could lead to the appearance of sharp wisplike features.

indistinguishable from a distribution peaked at z~1.5. Furthermore, we examine
the effects of cosmological surface brightness (SB) dimming on these

them to redshift z=5. We find that, comparing all galaxies at the same

z~0 to z~5. This suggests that there exists a population of objects with very
high star formation rates at high redshifts that apparently do not exist at low

intensity distribution that reaches peak fluxes a factor of 2 lower than could
be studied previously. The value of the V/Vmax statistic (in Euclidean space)
for the bursts we detect is 0.177 +/- 0.006. This surprisingly low value is
obtained because we detected very few bursts on the 4.096 s and 8.192 s time
scales (where most bursts have their highest signal-to-noise ratio) that were
not already detected on the 1.024 s time scale. If allowance is made for a
power-law distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities, the extended peak flux
distribution is consistent with models in which the redshift distribution of
the gamma-ray burst rate approximately traces the star formation history of the
Universe. We argue that this class of models is preferred over those in which
the burst rate is independent of redshift. We use the peak flux distribution to
derive a limit of 10% (99% confidence) on the fraction of the total burst rate

Fornax using previously published oxygen abundances for their planetary
nebulae. Our principal result is that the mean stellar oxygen abundances for
all of these galaxies correlate very well with their mean velocity dispersions.
This implies that the balance between energy input from type II supernovae and
the gravitational potential energy controls how far chemical evolution proceeds
in bulges, ellipticals, and dwarf spheroidals. It appears that chemical
evolution ceases once supernovae have injected sufficient energy that a
galactic wind develops. All of the galaxies follow a single relation between
oxygen abundance and luminosity, but the dwarf spheroidals have systematically
higher [O/Fe] ratios than the other galaxies. Consequently, dynamically hot
galaxies do not share a common star formation history nor need they share a
common chemical evolution, despite attaining similar mean stellar oxygen
abundances when forming similar stellar masses. The oxygen abundances support
previous indications that the stars in higher luminosity ellipticals and bulges
were formed on a shorter time scale than their counterparts in less luminous
systems. We calibrate the Mg$_2$ index for dynamically hot galaxies as a
function of observed age and oxygen abundance using the mean oxygen abundances
from the planetary nebulae and the best age estimates available for the stars

the wave front by horizontal flows, to obtain the two components of the
sub-surface flows as a function of the horizontal wave number and radial order

average rotation velocity at different latitudes obtained by this technique
agrees reasonably with helioseismic estimates made using frequency splitting

cosmological hydrodynamical simulations in a hierarchical clustering scenario,
sharing the same initial conditions. In the first one, a simple and generic
implementation of star formation has allowed galaxy-like objects with stellar
bulges and extended, populated disks to form. Gas in the disk comes from both,
particles that survive mergers keeping in part their angular momentum content,
and new gas supply by infall, once the merger process is over, with global
specific angular momentum conservation. The stellar bulge forms from gas that
has lost most of its angular momentum. In the second simulation, no star
formation has been included. In this case, objects consist of an overpopulated
central gas concentration, and an extended, underpopulated disk. The central
concentration forms from particles that suffer an important angular momentum
loss in violent events, and it often contains more than 70% of the object's
baryonic mass. The external disk forms by late infall of gas, that roughly
conserves its specific angular momentum. The difference between these two
simulations is likely to be due to the stabilizing character of the stellar
bulge-like cores that form in the first simulation, which diminishes the inflow
of gas triggered by mergers and interactions.

Tunneling and quantum-size effects are treated exactly using the scattering

with quantized jumps in the conductance. The force and conductance are shown to

reasonable results for nanowires of length L>>lambda_F, even for this abrupt

nanowire is calculated and the effects of screening are included within linear
response theory. Mesoscopic charge fluctuations of order e are predicted which
are strongly correlated with the mesoscopic force fluctuations. The local
density of states at the Fermi energy exhibits nontrivial behavior which is
correlated with fine structure in the force and conductance, showing the

and the case of long range correlations which has a totally different overlap
distribution which approaches a single delta function about q=1 for large L,
where L is the length of the walk. In the latter case the free energy is not
extensive in L for the intermediate and also relevant range of L values,
although in the true thermodynamic limit extensivity is restored. We identify a
crossover temperature which grows with L, and whenever T<T_c(L) the system is
always in the low temperature phase. Thus in the case of long-ranged
correlation as opposed to the short-ranged case a phase transition is absent.

exponentially. To support these large, high-speed networks, it is neccessary to
be able to forward packets in a few microseconds. One part of the forwarding
operation consists of searching through a large address databse. This problem
is encountered in the design of bridges, routers, gateways and name servers.
  Caching can reduce the lookup time if there is a locality in the address
reference pattern. Using a destination reference trace measured on an extended
local are a network, we attempt to see if the destination refernces do have a
significant locality.
  We compared the performance of MIN, LRU, FIFO, and random cache replacement
algorithms. We found that the interactive (terminal) traffic in our sample had
quite different locality behavior than that of the noninteractive traffic. The
interactive traffic did not follow the LRU stack model while the
noninteractivetraffic did. Examples are shown of the environments in which
caching can help as well as those in which caching can hurt, unless the cache

  56-71",,,"cs.NI",,"  In heterogeneous networks, achieving congestion avoidance is difficult
because the congestion feedback from one subnetwork may have no meaning to
source on other other subnetworks. We propose using changes in round-trip delay
as an implicit feedback. Using a black-box model of the network, we derive an
expression for the optimal window as a function of the gradient of the
delay-window curve.
  The problems of selfish optimum and social optimum are also addressed. It is
shown that without a careful design, it is possible to get into a race
condition during heavy congestion, where each user wants more resources than
others, thereby leading to a diverging congestion
  It is shown that congestion avoidance using round trip delay is a promising
approach. The aproach has the advantage that there is absolutely no overhead
for the network itself. It is exemplified by a simple scheme. The performance
of the scheme is analyzed using a simulation model. The scheme is shown to be
efficient, fair, convergent and adaptive to changes in network configuration.
  The scheme as described works only for networks that can ne modelled with
queueing servers with constant service times. Further research is required to
extend it for implementation in practical networks. Several directions for
future research have beensuggested.

interconnection of computers has made congestion a significant problem.
  In this report, we summarize our research on congestion avoidance. We compare
the concept of congestion avoidance with that of congestion control.
  Briefly, congestion control is a recovery mechanism, while congestion
avoidance is a prevention mechanism. A congestion control scheme helps the
network to recover from the congestion state while a congestion avoidance
scheme allows a network to operate in the region of low delay and high
throughput with minimal queuing, thereby preventing it from entering the
congested state in which packets are lost due to buffer shortage.
  A number of possible alternatives for congestion avoidance were identified.
  From these alternatives we selected one called the binary feedback scheme in
which the network uses a single bit in the network layer header to feed back
the congestion information to its users, which then increase or decrease their
load to make optimal use of the resources. The concept of global optimality in
a distributed system is defined in terms of efficiency and fairness such that
they can be independently quantified and apply to any number of resources and
users.
  The proposed scheme has been simulated and shown to be globally efficient,
fair, responsive, convergent, robust, distributed, and
configuration-independent.

the capacity and packets are lost due to too much queuing in the network.
During congestion, the network throughput may drop to zero and the path delay
may become very high. A congestion control scheme helps the network to recover
from the congestion state. A congestion avoidance scheme allows a network to
operate in the region of low delay and high throughput. Such schemes prevent a
network from entering the congested state. Congestion avoidance is a prevention
mechanism while congestion control is a recovery mechanism. We compare the
concept of congestion avoidance with that of flow control and congestion
control. A number of possible alternative for congestion avoidance have been
identified. From these a few were selected for study. The criteria for
selection and goals for these schemes have been described. In particular, we
wanted the scheme to be globally efficient, fair, dynamic, convergent, robust,
distributed, configuration independent, etc. These goals and the test cases
used to verify whether a particular scheme has met the goals have been
described. We model the network and the user policies for congestion avoidance
as a feedback control system. The key components of a generic congestion
avoidance scheme are: congestion detection, congestion feedback, feedback
selector, signal filter, decision function, and increase/decrease algorithms.
These components have been explained.

on the network. Based on this realization, we have developed a simple
congestion control scheme using the acknowledgment timeouts as indications of
packet loss and congestion. This scheme does not require any new message
formats, therefore, it can be used in any network with window flow control,

It is shown that a timeout algorithm consists of essentially five layers or
procedures which can be independently chosen and modified. A number of timeout
algorithms proposed in the literature have been decomposed into these five
layers.
  One of the key layers not discussed in the literature is that of determining
the sample round trip delay for packets that have been transmitted more than
once. It is shown that this layer has a significant impact on the network
performance.
  Under repeated packet loss, most timeout algorithms either diverge or
converge to a wrong value. A number of alternative schemes have been presented.
It is argued that divergence is preferable to false convergence. It is a
feature that is helpful in reducing network traffic congestion.

without relying on a pre-established routing table, and an efficient flood
control algorithm to reduce the signalling traffic overhead. This is an
inherently robust mechanism in the face of a network configuration change,
achieves automatic load sharing across alternative routes and has potential to
solve many contemporary routing problems. An earlier version of this mechanism
was originally developed for virtual circuit establishment in the experimental

gravity in which a central role is played by a class of Spin(4) spin networks

motivated constraints. Here a proof is presented that demonstrates that the
intertwiner of a vertex of such a spin network is uniquely determined, up to
normalization, by the representations on the incident edges and the
constraints. Moreover, the constraints, which were formulated for four valent
spin networks only, are extended to networks of arbitrary valence, and the
generalized relativistic spin networks proposed by Yetter are shown to form the
entire solution set (mod normalization) of the extended constraints. Finally,
using the extended constraints, the Barrett-Crane model is generalized to
arbitrary polyhedral complexes (instead of just simplicial complexes)
representing spacetime. It is explained how this model, like the Barret-Crane
model can be derived from BF theory by restricting the sum over histories to
ones in which the left handed and right handed areas of any 2-surface are
equal. It is known that the solutions of classical Euclidean GR form a branch
of the stationary points of the BF action with respect to variations preserving
this condition.

without self coupling, we find no additional growth of super-horizon modes

increase in the value of the gravitational potential, which may lead to

curves and its compactification. Generalized spin curves, or r-spin curves, are
a natural generalization of 2-spin curves (algebraic curves with a
theta-characteristic), and have been of interest lately because of the
similarities between the intersection theory of these moduli spaces and that of
the moduli of stable maps. In particular, these spaces are the subject of a
remarkable conjecture of E. Witten relating their intersection theory to the
Gelfand-Dikii (rth KdV) heirarchy. There is also a W-algebra conjecture for
these spaces, analogous to the Virasoro conjecture of quantum cohomology.
  We construct a smooth compactification of the stack of smooth r-spin curves,
describe the geometric meaning of its points, and prove that it is projective.
We also prove that when r is odd and g>1, the compactified stack of spin curves
and its coarse moduli space are irreducible, and when r is even and g>1, the
stack is the disjoint union of two irreducible components. We give similar
results for n-pointed spin curves, as required for Witten's conjecture, and
also generalize to the n-pointed case the classical fact that when g=1, the
moduli of r-spin curves is the disjoint union of d(r) components, where d(r) is
the number of positive divisors of r. These irreducibility properties are
important in the study of the Picard group of the stack, and also in the study
of the cohomological field theory related to Witten's conjecture (see
math.AG/9905034).

lower than that of pure liquid iron at Earth's core conditions. It is shown

mechanics. Ordinarily, one imposes the condition $H^\dagger=H$ on the
Hamiltonian, where $\dagger$ represents the mathematical operation of complex
conjugation and matrix transposition. This conventional Hermiticity condition
is sufficient to ensure that the Hamiltonian $H$ has a real spectrum. However,
replacing this mathematical condition by the weaker and more physical
requirement $H^\ddag=H$, where $\ddag$ represents combined parity reflection
and time reversal ${\cal PT}$, one obtains new classes of complex Hamiltonians
whose spectra are still real and positive. This generalization of Hermiticity
is investigated using a complex deformation $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon$ of the
harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, where $\epsilon$ is a real parameter. The
system exhibits two phases: When $\epsilon\geq0$, the energy spectrum of $H$ is
real and positive as a consequence of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry. However, when
$-1<\epsilon<0$, the spectrum contains an infinite number of complex
eigenvalues and a finite number of real, positive eigenvalues because ${\cal
PT}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken. The phase transition that occurs at
$\epsilon=0$ manifests itself in both the quantum-mechanical system and the
underlying classical system. Similar qualitative features are exhibited by
complex deformations of other standard real Hamiltonians
$H=p^2+x^{2N}(ix)^\epsilon$ with $N$ integer and $\epsilon>-N$; each of these
complex Hamiltonians exhibits a phase transition at $\epsilon=0$. These ${\cal
PT}$-symmetric theories may be viewed as analytic continuations of conventional
theories from real to complex phase space.

admissible endowed with the non-negative norm of Hilbert space vectors. Hence,
they provide the desired canonical basis for the algebraic formulation of the
quantum phase problem. Certain equivalence classes in the space of labels are
identified within each subalgebra, and connections with area-preserving
canonical transformations are examined. The generalized representations of the
Wigner function are examined in the finite-dimensional cyclic Schwinger basis.
