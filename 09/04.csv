providing the first statistically meaningful comparison of the morphologies,
luminosities, scalelengths and colours of the host galaxies of radio-quiet
quasars, radio-loud quasars, and radio galaxies. We describe the design of this
study and present the images which have been obtained for the first half of our
33-source sample. We find that the hosts of all three classes of luminous AGN
are massive elliptical galaxies, with scalelengths ~=10 kpc, and R-K colours
consistent with mature stellar populations. Most importantly this is the the
first unambiguous evidence that, just like radio-loud quasars, essentially all
radio-quiet quasars brighter than M_R = -24 reside in massive ellipticals. This
result removes the possibility that radio `loudness' is directly linked to host
galaxy morphology, but is however in excellent accord with the
black-hole/spheroid mass correlation recently highlighted by Magorrian et al.
(1998). We apply the relations given by Magorrian et al. to infer the expected
Eddington luminosity of the putative black hole at the centre of each of the
spheroidal host galaxies we have uncovered. Comparison with the actual nuclear
R-band luminosities suggests that the black holes in most of these galaxies are
radiating at a few percent of the Eddington luminosity; the brightest host
galaxies in our low-z sample are capable of hosting quasars with M_R = -28,
comparable to the most luminous quasars at z = 3. Finally we discuss our
host-derived black-hole masses in the context of the
radio-luminosity:black-hole mass correlation recently uncovered for nearby
galaxies by Franceschini et al. (1998), and the resulting implications for the
physical origin of radio loudness.

observation of the powerful FRII radio galaxy 3C 219 reveal an absorbed
point-like source, coincident with the nucleus, and a non-thermal extended
component aligned with the radio structure. The point-like source can be
readily interpreted as a hidden quasar in the nucleus, giving further support
to the unification scheme of FRII radio galaxies and radio loud quasars. The
coincidence between the X-ray (0.1-10 keV) and radio spectral index suggest
that most of the emission associated with the extended component is due to the
inverse Compton process in the radio lobes. The extended circumnuclear emission
can be understood as Compton scattering of the IR-optical radiation emitted by
the hidden quasar and surrounding dusty/molecular torus. This is the first
observational evidence supporting the existence of this effect, which also
probes the relativistic electron spectrum at energies much lower than those
involved in the synchrotron radio emission. The observed X-ray flux can be
matched by assuming that the energy density of the relativistic particles
exceed the equipartition value by about a factor of 10. At larger distances
from the nucleus ($\geq 70$kpc) the inverse Compton scattering with the cosmic
microwave background photons becomes more important and may explain the
observed X-ray features if positive fluctuations in the column densities of
relativistic electrons are present. Alternatively, one cannot exclude with the
present data a thermal contribution by hot clumpy gas surrounding the radio
lobes.

from stellar population synthesis models the galaxy distances were determined.
All of these dE candidates turned out to be satellites of Scl group major
members. A redshift measurement of the dE candidate ESO294-010 yielded an
independent confirmation of its group membership: the [OIII] and H$_\alpha$
emission lines from a small HII region gave a heliocentric velocity of 117(\pm
5) km s-1, in close agreement with the velocity of its parent galaxy NGC 55
(v_\odot=125 km s-1). The precision of the SBF distances (5 to 10%) contributes
to delineating the cigar-like distribution of the Scl group members, which
extend over distances from 1.7 to 4.4 Mpc and are concentrated in three,
possibly four subclumps. The Hubble diagram for nine Scl galaxies, including
two of our dEs, exhibits a tight linear velocity--distance relation with a
steep slope of 119 km s-1 Mpc-1. The results indicate that gravitational
interaction among the Scl group members plays only a minor role in the dynamics

disturbed by the large masses of our Galaxy and M31 leading to the observed
shearing motion. From the distances and velocities of 49 galaxies located in

gamma-ray continuum emission from the Galactic plane, which is commonly
interpreted as evidence for the possible existence of a strong flux of
low-energy cosmic ray electrons. In this paper I discuss the scenario of a
hadronic origin of the soft Galactic gamma-ray continuum through inverse
bremsstrahlung. A flux of low-energy cosmic rays strong enough to produce the
observed spectrum of gamma-rays implies substantial gamma-ray emission at a few
MeV through nuclear de-excitation. It is shown that the existing limits on
excess 3-7 MeV emission from the Galactic plane, in concert with the
constraints from pion-decay gamma-ray emission at higher energies, are in
serious conflict with an inverse bremsstrahlung origin of the Galactic soft
gamma-ray emission for any physically plausible low-energy cosmic ray spectrum.
While in case of energetic heavy nuclei the limits are violated by about an
order of magnitude, for a large population of low-energy protons the implied
gamma-ray line flux and pion-decay continuum intensity are larger than the

from $T_{CMB}$ by at most 10% at redshift $z=0$. The \lya cloud dust opacity to
redshift $\sim 5$ sources around the observed wavelength $\lambda_0 \sim 1
\mu$m is $\sim 0.13$, and could affect observations of the distant universe in
that band. The expected CMB spectral distortions due to high-$z$ dust in \lya
clouds is $\sim 1.25-10$ smaller than the current COBE upper limit, depending
on the metallicity evolution of the clouds. If \lya clouds are clustered, the
corresponding CMB anisotropy due to dust is $\sim 10^{-1}$ on angular scales
$\theta \simlt 10''$ at frequencies probed by various future/ongoing FIR
missions, which makes these fluctuations potentially detectable in the near
future. Emission from CII fine-structure transitions could considerably
contribute to submm range of the FIR background radiation. Depending on the
ionization of carbon and on the density of metal enriched regions, this
contribution can be comparable with the observed residual flux at
$\lambda\approx 0.15$ mm, after CMB subtraction. We argue that constraints on
metal evolution versus redshift can be obtained from the observed flux in that
range.

effect of finite terraces translates into a number-non-conserving term in the
boson Hamiltonian, which does not allow a description in terms of fermions, but
leads to a two-chain spin problem. The Heisenberg spin-1 chain is recovered as
a special limiting case. The global phase diagram is rich. We find the DOF

of up-down steps is essential in producing a DOF phase, whereas an off-site

of these surfaces and those of their associated wavefronts. We then treat the
same set of issues from an alternative point of view, namely from Arnold's
theory of generating families. This treatment allows one to deal
(parametrically) with the regions of self-intersection and non-smoothness of
the null surfaces, regions which are difficult to treat otherwise.
  Finally we generalize the analysis of the singularities to families of
solutions of the eikonal equation.

interaction. The scalar supresses this symmetry breaking and induces a line of
second order transitions with scaling properties similar to the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. However, in the vicinity of a particular,
tricritical point the scaling properties are different. Here we study the
effective Yukawa coupling between the massive fermion and the Goldstone boson.
The perturbative triviality bound of Yukawa models is nearly saturated. The
theory is similar to strongly coupled Yukawa models except the occurrence of an
additional state -- a gauge ball of mass $m_S \simeq 1/2 m_F$. This, and
non-classical values of tricritical exponents suggest that at the tricritical

paying particular attention to the contribution of tensor and spin-orbit terms.
It is shown that the latter ones heavily affect the calculated spectra at
variance with the empirical observation of the weakness of the baryon
spin-orbit splittings. The relativistic suppression of the strength of the
interaction among light quarks is argued to be a possible way to reproduce the
light-baryon mass spectra.

regime, we are able to apply recently developed phase-diagram technology
(quantum Pirogov-Sinai theory) to conclude that the zero-temperature phase
diagrams obtained for the leading classical part remain valid, except for thin
excluded regions and small deformations, for the full-fledged quantum
interaction at zero or small temperature. Moreover, the phase diagram is stable
upon the addition of arbitrary, but sufficiently small, further quantum terms
that do not break the ground-states symmetries. This generalizes and unifies a
number of previous results on the subject; in particular published results on
the zero-temperature phase diagram of the Falikov-Kimball model (with and
without magnetic flux) are extended to small temperatures and/or small ionic
hopping. We give explicit expressions for the first few orders, in the hopping

stellar processes in a progenitor star prior to a super-nova collapse. Several
attempts to constrain the p-wave S-factor of the 12C(a,g)16O reaction at Helium
burning temperatures (200 MK) using the beta-delayed alpha-particle emission of
16N have been made, and it is claimed that this S-factor is known, as quoted by
the TRIUMF collaboration. In contrast reanalyses (by G.M. hale) of all thus far
available data (including the 16N data) does not rule out a small S-factor
solution. Furthermore, we improved our previous Yale-UConn study of the beta-
delayed alpha-particle emission of \n16 by improving our statistical sample (by
more than a factor of 5), improving the energy resolution of the experiment (by
20%), and in understanding our line shape, deduced from measured quantities.
Our newly measured spectrum of the beta-delayed alpha-particle emission of 16N
is not consistent with the TRIUMF('94) data, but is consistent with the
Seattle('95) data, as well as the earlier (unaltered !) data of Mainz('71). The
implication of this discrepancies for the extracted astrophysical p-wave
s-factor is briefly discussed.

energy behavior of the damping width. It may provides a new tool for study of

pressure and medium saturation. We choose a modified phase-field model of
solidification as a particular case of such dynamic relation. We show that in
the traveling wave regime the results obtained from our approach reproduce
those derived from the standard model of flow in porous media. In more general
case, the proposed approach reveals the dependence of front dynamics upon the
flow regime.

noise. Entropy values and compression rates are shown to depend on the shape of
this power spectrum, given different normalizations. The cases of white noise

  Quantum mechanical interpretations of various observations and their
  implications, including some issues that are usually ignored, are presented
  and compared here with the gauge mechanical descriptions",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The basic premise of Quantum Mechanics, embodied in the doctrine of
wave-particle duality, assigns both, a particle and a wave structure to the
physical entities. The classical laws describing the motion of a particle and
the evolution of a wave are assumed to be correct. Gauge Mechanics treats the
discrete entities as particles, and their motion is described by an extension
of the corresponding classical laws. Quantum mechanical interpretations of
various observations and their implications, including some issues that are
usually ignored, are presented and compared here with the gauge mechanical
descriptions. The considerations are confined mainly to the conceptual
foundations and the internal consistency of these theories. Although no major
differences between their predictions have yet been noticed, some deviations
are expected, which are indicated. These cases may provide the testing grounds
for further investigations.
