full-sky sample of 297 Sb-Sc spirals with redshifts between 4500 and 7000 km/s.
The survey was specifically designed to provide uniform, well- calibrated data
over both hemispheres. All previous TF surveys within the Supergalactic shell
(cz < 6000 km/s) have relied on matching separate data sets in the Northern and
Southern hemispheres and thus cannot attain full- sky homogeneity. Analyses of
the cosmological dipole and peculiar velocities based on these studies have
produced contradictory claims for the amplitude of the bulk flow and whether it
is generated by internal or external mass fluctuations. With Shellflow, and
further zero-point calibration of existing TF data sets, we expect a
high-accuracy detection of the bulk flow amplitude and an unambiguous
characterization of the tidal field at 6000 km/s. One of the key features of
this study is not only its careful, all-sky sample selection but the
independent duplication, by at least 2 of us, of all the data reductions. These
reductions and a first flow analysis based on the Shellflow sample alone will
be published in the Fall.

opportunities for relating the conditions within the Milky Way halo and nearby
intergalactic gas to the properties of galactic halos at higher redshift.
  The C IV-HVCs have ionization properties consistent with photoionization by
extragalactic background radiation, though some contribution by collisional
ionization within a hot plasma cannot be ruled out. The clouds are probably low
density [n(H) ~ 10^-4 cm^-3], large [greater than several kiloparsecs], and
mostly ionized [n(HI)/n(H) ~ 10^-3] regions located well beyond the neutral gas
layer of the Galaxy. The presence of weak H I-HVCs detected through 21cm
emission near both sight lines indicates that the C IV-HVCs trace the extended,
ionized, low density regions of the H I-HVCs. Several lines of evidence,
including very low thermal pressures (P/k ~ 2 cm^-3 K), favor a location for
the C IV-HVCs in the Local Group or very distant Galactic halo.

implications for the beat frequency model of kilohertz quasi-periodic

observed frequency is the stellar spin frequency or its first overtone. Here we
report an analysis of five bursts from 4U 1636-536 which exhibit strong

first 0.75 seconds of each of the five bursts yields a signal at 290 Hz that is
significant at the $4\times 10^{-5}$ level when the number of trials is taken

neutron star and that 580 Hz is its first overtone, in agreement with other
arguments about this source but in contrast to suggestions in the literature
that 580 Hz is the true spin frequency. The method used here, which is an
algorithm for combining time series data from the five bursts so that the
phases of the 580 Hz oscillations are aligned, may be used in any source to
search for weak oscillations that have frequencies related in a definite way to
the frequency of a strong oscillation.

in our previous, non-retarded theory [Johansson, Monreal, and Apell, Phys. Rev.

properties of tip and sample are described by experimentally measured
dielectric functions. The calculations are based on exact diffraction theory
through the vector equivalent of the Kirchoff integral. The present results are
qualitatively similar to those of the non-retarded calculations. The light
emission spectra have pronounced resonance peaks due to the formation of a
tip-induced plasmon mode localized to the cavity between the tip and the
sample. At a quantitative level, the effects of retardation are rather small as
long as the sample material is Au or Cu, and the tip consists of W or Ir.
However, for Ag samples, in which the resistive losses are smaller, the
inclusion of retardation effects in the calculation leads to larger changes:
the resonance energy decreases by 0.2-0.3 eV, and the resonance broadens. These
changes improve the agreement with experiment. For a Ag sample and an Ir tip,
the quantum efficiency is $\approx$ 10$^{-4}$ emitted photons in the visible
frequency range per tunneling electron. A study of the energy dissipation into
the tip and sample shows that in total about 1 % of the electrons undergo

speed up evaluation of Whittle's estimator for H, the Hurst parameter giving

nondecreasing function of the parameter in the real quadratic family, which
corresponds to the intuitive idea that more nonlinearity induces more complex
dynamical behavior. Polynomial families of higher degree depend on several
parameters, so that the very question of monotonicity needs to be reformulated.
For instance, one can say the entropy is monotone in a multiparameter family if
the isentropes, or sets of maps with the same topological entropy, are
connected. Here we reduce the problem of the connectivity of the isentropes in
the real cubic families to a weak form of the Fatou conjecture on generic
hyperbolicity, which was proved to hold true by C. Heckman. We also develop
some tools which may prove to be useful in the study of other parameterized
families, in particular a general monotonicity result for stunted sawtooth
maps: the stunted sawtooth family of a given shape can be understood as a
simple family which realizes all the possible combinatorial structures one can
expect with a map of this shape on the basis of kneading theory. Roughly
speaking, our main result about real cubic families is that they are as
monotone as the stunted sawtooth families with the same shapes because of
Heckman's result (there are two posible shapes for cubic maps, depending on the
behavior at infinity).

on the algebra of compact operators (necessarily coming from unitary
representations), and show that this gives an attractive view of the subject of
square-integrable representations.

foliation theory and dynamical systems, it has now become an interesting
subject of its own.

constructed by C.J.Read, then there are three operators S_1, S_2 and K
(non-multiples of the identity) such that T commutes with S_1, S_1 commutes
with S_2, S_2 commutes with K, and K is compact. It is also shown that the
commutant of T contains only series of T.

  International Conference on Secondary calculus and cohomological Physics,
  Moscow, August 1997",,,,"math.DG hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  It is shown that the new formula for the field theory Poisson brackets arise
naturally in the extension of the formal variational calculus incorporating
divergences. The linear spaces of local functionals, evolutionary vector
fields, functional forms, multi-vectors and differential operators become
graded with respect to divergences. The bilinear operations, such as the action
of vector fields on functionals, the commutator of vector fields, the interior
product of forms and vectors and the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket are compatible
with the grading. A definition of the adjoint graded operator is proposed and
antisymmetric operators are constructed with the help of boundary terms. The
fulfilment of the Jacobi identity for the new Poisson brackets is shown to be
equivalent to vanishing of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of the Poisson
bivector with itself. It is demonstrated, as an example, that the second
structure of the Korteweg-de Vries equation is not Hamiltonian with respect to
the new brackets until special boundary conditions are prescribed.

equilibrium in the projectile-target degrees of freedom is in general not
reached even for large systems at low energy where elastic nucleon-nucleon
collisions dominate. Inelastic nucleon excitations are more favorable for
equilibration and their relative abundance increases both with energy and mass.
Experimentally, the projectile/target admixture can be determined by measuring
the degree of isospin equilibration in isospin asymmetric nuclear collisions.
For one of the most promising systems currently under investigation,
${}^{96}_{44}{\rm Ru}+{}^{96}_{40}{\rm Zr}$, we investigate the influence of
the equation of state and the inelastic in-medium cross section.

interval $[0,1]$. Under these assumptions, our equation has a continuous family
of monotone propagating fronts (or travelling waves) indexed by the speed
parameter $c \ge c_*$. Using energy estimates, we first show that the
travelling waves are locally stable with respect to perturbations in a weighted
Sobolev space. Then, under additional assumptions on the non-linearity, we
obtain global stability results using a suitable version of the hyperbolic
Maximum Principle. Finally, in the critical case $c = c_*$, we use self-similar
variables to compute the exact asymptotic behavior of the perturbations as $t

stability results for the travelling waves of the corresponding parabolic

order of magnitude larger than the logical machine contained within it in order
to be reliable. For example, a scale-up by a factor of 22, with gate error rate
of order $10^{-5}$, is sufficient to permit large quantum algorithms such as
