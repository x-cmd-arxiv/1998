classes of centrally-concentrated UV-bright stars. Color-magnitude diagrams
constructed from U, B, V, and I data obtained with the HST/WFPC2 reveal seven
UV-bright stars fainter than the main-sequence turnoff, three of which had
previously been identified as cataclysmic variables (CVs). Lightcurves of these
stars show the characteristic ``flicker'' of CVs, as well as longer-term
variability. A fourth star is identified as a CV candidate on the basis of its
variability and UV excess. Three additional UV-bright stars show no photometric
variability and have broad-band colors characteristic of B stars. These
non-flickering UV stars are too faint to be extended horizontal branch stars.
We suggest that they could be low-mass helium white dwarfs, formed when the
evolution of a red giant is interrupted, due either to Roche-lobe overflow onto
a binary companion, or to envelope ejection following a common-envelope phase
in a tidal-capture binary. Alternatively, they could be very-low-mass
core-He-burning stars. Both the CVs and the new class of faint UV stars are
strongly concentrated toward the cluster center, to the extent that mass
segregation from 2-body relaxation alone may be unable to explain their
distribution.

galaxy density field, the so-called Supergalactic Plane (SGP). This structure
is studied here in three dimensions using both the new Optical Redshift Survey
(ORS) and the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift survey. The density contrast in a slab of
thickness of 20 Mpc/h and diameter of 80 Mpc/h aligned with the standard de
Vaucouleurs' Supergalactic coordinates, is delta_sgp =0.5 for both ORS and
IRAS. The structure of the SGP is not well described by a homogeneous
ellipsoid, although it does appear to be a flattened structure, which we
quantify by calculating the moment of inertia tensor of the density field. The
directions of the principal axes vary with radius, but the minor axis remains
within 30 deg of the standard SGP Z-axis, out to a radius of 80 Mpc/h, for both
ORS and \iras. However, the structure changes shape with radius, varying
between a flattened pancake and a dumbbell, the latter at a radius of ~50
Mpc/h, where the Great Attractor and Perseus-Pisces superclusters dominate the
distribution. This calls to question the connectivity of the `plane' beyond ~40
Mpc/h. The configuration found here can be viewed as part of a web of filaments
and sheets, rather than as an isolated pancake-like structure. An optimal
minimum variance reconstruction of the density field using Wiener filtering
which corrects for both redshift distortion and shot noise, yields a similar
misalignment angle and behaviour of axes. The background-independent statistic
of axes proposed here can be best used for testing cosmological models by
comparison with N-body simulations.

integrated intensity ratios at a transition $J$=1--0, $R =
I(^{12}$CO)$/I(^{13}$CO) $\gtrsim 20$, in a sample of starburst merging
galaxies such as Arp 220 are mainly attributed to the depression of $^{13}$CO
emission with respect to $^{12}$CO. Investigating the same sample of galaxies
analyzed by Taniguchi & Ohyama, we find that there is a tight, almost linear
correlation between the dust mass and $^{13}$CO luminosity. This implies that
dust grains are also depressed in the high-$R$ starburst mergers, leading to
the higher dust temperature ($T_{\rm d}$) in them because of the relative
increase in the radiation density. Nevertheless, the average dust mass ($M_{\rm
d}$) of the high-$R$ starburst mergers is higher significantly than that of
non-high $R$ galaxies. This is naturally understood because the galaxy mergers
could accumulate a lot of dust grains from their progenitor galaxies together
with supply of dust grains formed newly in the star forming regions. Since
$L$(FIR) $\propto M_{\rm d} T_{\rm d}^5$ given the dust emissivity law, $S_\nu
\propto \lambda^{-1}$, the increases in both $M_{\rm d}$ and $T_{\rm d}$
explain well why the starburst mergers are so bright in the FIR. We discuss
that the superwind activity plays an important role in destroying dust grains
as well as dense gas clouds in the central region of mergers.

determine the crossover from purely quantum diffusion to a diffusion which is
the quantum manifestation of classical diffusion along the stochastic web. This

phase are all due to Bose condensations of spinons and holons, respectively, on
the top of a spin background described by bosonic resonating-valence-bond (RVB)
pairing. The fact that both spinon and holon here are bosonic objects, as the
result of the phase string effect, represents a crucial difference from the
conventional slave-boson and slave-fermion approaches. This theory also allows
an underdoped metallic regime where the Bose condensation of spinons can still
exist. Even though the AFLRO is gone here, such a regime corresponds to a
microscopic charge inhomogeneity with short-ranged spin ordering. We discuss
some characteristic experimental consequences for those different metallic
regimes. A perspective on broader issues based on the phase string theory is

existence of normal conditional expectations of finite index on certain type
II_1 von Neumann algebras with center l_\infty which are not algebraically of
finite index in the sense of Y. Watatani. We show that estimates of the minimal
number of module generators by a function of [K(E)] cannot exist for certain
type II_1 von Neumann algebras with non-trivial center.

  coupled oscillators","LaTeX 2e, 39 pages, 14 figures",,,"LIGO-T970229-R","physics.optics",,"  The dynamics of Fabry-Perot cavity with suspended mirrors is described. The
suspended mirrors are nonlinear oscillators interacting with each other through
the laser circulating in the cavity. The degrees of freedom decouple in normal
coordinates, which are the position of the center of mass and the length of the
cavity. We introduce two parameters and study how the dynamics changes with
respect to these parameters. The first parameter specifies how strong the
radiation pressure is. It determines whether the cavity is multistable or not.
The second parameter is the control parameter, which determines location of the
cavity equilibrium states. The equilibrium state shows hysteresis if the
control parameter varies within a wide range. We analyze stability of the
equilibrium states and identify the instability region. The instability is
explained in terms of the effective potential: the stable states correspond to
local minima of the effective potential and unstable states correspond to local
maxima. The minima of the effective potential defines the resonant frequencies
for the oscillations of the cavity length. We find the frequencies, and analyze
how to tune them. Multistability of the cavity with a feedback control system
is analyzed in terms of the servo potential. The results obtained in this paper
are general and apply to all Fabry-Perot cavities with suspended mirrors.

approximation method to describe the dynamics of Bose-Einstein Condesation
(BEC) (C.W. Gardiner, Phys. Rev. A 56, 1414 (1997)) is shown to be a physical
realization of the $q$-deformed boson, which was abstractly developed in
quantum group theory. On this observation, the coherent output of BEC atoms
driven by a radio frequency (r.f) field is analyzed in the viewpoint of a
$q$-deformed Fock space. It is illustrated that the $q$-deformation of bosonic
commutation relation corresponds to the non-ideal BEC with the finite particle
number $N$ of condensated atoms. Up to order 1/N, the coherent output state of
the untrapped atoms minimizes the uncertainty relation like a coherent state
does in the ideal case of BEC that $N$ approaches infinity or $q=1-2/N$
approaches one.

the fermionic superfluids, we show that the vortex dynamics can be followed
naturally by extending Feynman's influence functional approach to incorporate
the transverse force.
  There is a striking mutual independence of the transverse and longitudinal
influences:
  The former has the topological origin and is insensitive to details, while
the latter corresponds to the well-known damping kernel depending on details.
