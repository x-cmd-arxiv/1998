  knawproc.cls",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Over the past three decades the established view of a nearly homogeneuous,
featureless Universe on scales larger than a few Megaparsec has been completely
overhauled. In particular through the advent of ever larger galaxy redshift
surveys we were revealed a galaxy distribution displaying an intriguing
cellular pattern in which filamentary and wall-like structures, as well as huge
regions devoid of galaxies, are amongst the most conspicuous morphological
elements. In this contribution we will provide an overview of the present
observational state of affairs concerning the distribution of galaxies and the
structure traced out by the matter distribution in our Universe. In conjunction
with the insight on the dynamics of the structure formation process obtained
through the mapping of the peculiar velocities of galaxies in our local
Universe and the information on the embryonic circumstances that prevailed at
the epoch of Recombination yielded by the various Cosmic Microwave Background
experiments, we seek to arrive at a more or less compelling theoretical
framework of structure formation.The main aspects of this framework of the rise
of structure through gravitational instability can probably be most readily
appreciated through illustrative examples of various scenarios, as for instance
provided by some current state-of-the-art N-body simulations. We will
subsequently wrap up the observational and theoretical evidence for the
emergence and evolution of structure in the Universe by sketching the stage for
the ultimate Holy Grail of late 20th century astrophysics, understanding the
saga of the formation of what arguably are the most prominent and at the same
time intoxicatingly beautiful and intriguing denizens of our Cosmos, the {\it
galaxies}.

Close comparison between the Boltzmann solver and a Monte Carlo transport code
has been made for realistic atmospheres of post bounce core models under the
assumption of a static background. We have also investigated in detail the
dependence of the results on the numbers of radial, angular, and energy grid
points and the way to discretize the spatial advection term which is used in
the Boltzmann solver. A general relativistic calculation has been done for one
of the models. We find overall good agreement between the two methods. However,
because of a relatively small number of angular grid points (which is
inevitable due to limitations of the computation time) the Boltzmann solver
tends to underestimate the flux factor and the Eddington factor outside the
(mean) ``neutrinosphere'' where the angular distribution of the neutrinos
becomes highly anisotropic. This fact suggests that one has to be cautious in
applying the Boltzmann solver to a calculation of the neutrino heating in the
hot-bubble region because it might tend to overestimate the local energy
deposition rate. A comparison shows that this trend is opposite to the results
obtained with a multi-group flux-limited diffusion approximation of neutrino
transport. The accuracy of the Boltzmann solver can be considerably improved by
using a variable angular mesh to increase the angular resolution in the
semi-transparent regime.

for self-consistency that scattering effects in this region are not important.
The black hole mass ($M \approx 6 M_\odot$), the inclination angle ($\mu
\approx 0.5$) and the distance to the source ($D \approx 5$ kpc) have been
constrained by optical observations during quiescence (Orosz et al. 1996).
Using these values we find that the accretion rate during the peak was ${\dot
M} \approx 8 \times 10^{19}$ g sec$^{-1}$ and subsequently decayed
exponentially. We define a radiative fraction ($f$) to be the ratio of the
X-ray energy luminosity to the total gravitational power dissipated for a
keplerian accretion disk. We find that $f \approx 0.1$ and remains nearly
constant during the Ultra-soft and Soft spectral states. Thus for these states,
the inner region of the accretion disk is advection dominated. $f$ probably
increased to $\approx 0.5$ during the Hard state and finally decreased to
$\approx 0.03$ as the source returned to quiescence.

intense soft X-ray spectrum during a HEAO-1 A2 observation in the 1978. Such an
exceptionally soft X-ray state has never been observed subsequently, but the
source has continued to exhibit a large (up to a factor 6) range of X-ray
intensity variability. The overall UV/X-ray spectrum of this source, observed
during a multiwavelength campaign in 1991-1992, can be well fit with a
self-consistent, low-m-dot accretion disk model. In this model, the soft X-rays
result were suggested to arise from reflection of the nuclear emission by
mildly ionized material in the inner regions of the disk. In this Paper we
report the results of an ASCA observation in 1995 August, which give a direct
confirmation of such a scenario. The spectrum may be modeled as a power-law
with a photon index of 1.8, together with absorption consistent with the
galactic line of sight value, substantial reflection from ionized material and
an iron fluorescent K-alpha emission line. The centroid energy (~6.6--6.8 keV)
implies a ionization stage >Fe XIX. The line profile is consistent with that
expected from a kinematically and gravitationally distorted line around a black
hole. These results provide the first direct evidence for the existence of
considerable amount of ionized material around the nucleus of a ""broad"" Seyfert
1 galaxy.

component with typical temperature ~1 keV. X1724-308is detected in the PDS up
to 150 keV with a S/N ratio >3, notwithstanding a sharp exponential cutoff at

Comptonization of a Wien photon distribution with kT ~1 keV by a
spherically-symmetric hot plasma with electron temperature ~30 keV and optical
depth ~3. A comparison with the fainter and steeper state, which was observed
by EXOSAT, suggests a correlation between the temperature of the Comptonizing
electron distribution (or the plasma optical depth) and the X-ray intensity.
The X-ray thermal component could originate from a boundary layer between the
accretion disk and the compact object, or from the accretion disk itself.

sufficiently high S/N to be detected explaining the non-detection of this WC

all regions (except NGC 3049) contain a mixed population of WNL, and early WC
stars. A spatial offset between the nebular emission and stellar light is
observed in 2 objects. Due to age differences the nebular structures around the
WR regions are possibly smaller than those mainly energized by SNe. The spatial
distribution of WR stars follows the stellar continuum. We derive the absolute
number of WR stars of different subtypes. The WC/WN ratios have typical values
between 0.2-0.4, and show no clear trend with metallicity (Z). For low-Z
objects, these values are larger than the observed WC/WN ratios in Local Group
objects, but compatible with expectations for short bursts of if stellar
evolution models with high mass loss are used. The ages of the starburst
regions are 3-6 Myr; the burst duration must not exceed 2-4 Myr to account for
the high population of WR stars, even if emission line stars similar to those
in R136 and NGC 3603 are common in starbursts. Within the uncertainties most of
the observed quantities are reproduced by models with a Salpeter IMF. Although
some WR lines are stronger than predicted, no clear case requiring a
significantly flatter IMF is found. IMF slopes much steeper than Salpeter may,
however, not be compatible with our data. (Abridged abstract)

processing computers co-ordinating memory related responses to a multitude of
input signals from sensory organs. Information storage, update and appropriate
retrieval are controlled at the molecular level by the neuronal cytoskeleton
which serves as the internal communication network within neurons. Information
flow in the highly ordered parallel networks of the filamentous protein
polymers which make up the cytoskeleton may be compared to atmospheric flows
which exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations, i.e. long-term memory.
Such long-range spatiotemporal correlations are ubiquitous to real world
dynamical systems and is recently identified as signature of self-organized
criticality or chaos. The signatures of self-organized criticality i.e.
long-range temporal correlations have recently been identified in the
electrical activity of the brain. A recently developed non-deterministic cell
dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed long-range
spatiotemporal correlations as intrinsic to quantum-like mechanics governing
flow dynamics. The model visualises large scale circulations to form as the
result of spatial integration of enclosed small scale perturbations with
intrinsic two-way ordered energy flow between the scales. Such a concept maybe
applied for the collection and integration of a multitude of signals at the
cytoskeletal level and manifested in activation of neurons in the macroscale.
The cytoskeleton networks inside neurons may be the elementary units of a
unified dynamic memory circulation network with intrinsic global response to
local stimuli.

nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction V, plus a long-ranged Coulomb tail. The
electron-phonon interaction is treated in the deformation potential
approximation. We have explored the phase diagram of this model including the
possibility of commensurate 3x3 phases, using mainly the Hartree-Fock
approximation. For U larger than the bandwidth we find a non-collinear
antiferromagnetic SDW insulator, possibly corresponding to the situation on the
SiC and K/Si surfaces. For U comparable or smaller, a rich phase diagram
arises, with several phases involving combinations of charge and
spin-density-waves (SDW), with or without a net magnetization. We find that
insulating, or partly metallic 3x3 CDW phases can be stabilized by two
different physical mechanisms. One is the inter-site repulsion V, that together
with electron-phonon coupling can lower the energy of a charge modulation. The
other is a novel magnetically-induced Fermi surface nesting, stabilizing a net
cell magnetization of 1/3, plus a collinear SDW, plus an associated weak CDW.

distortion that emerges from this work is comprehensive, spanning weak,
intermediate, and strong electron-phonon coupling, and non-adiabatic, weakly
adiabatic, and strongly adiabatic regimes. Using the effective mass as the
primary criterion, the self-trapping transition is precisely defined and
located. Using related band-shape criteria at the Brillouin zone edge, the

divide the polaron parameter space into three regimes of distinct polaron
structure, essentially constituting a polaron phase diagram. Though the
self-trapping transition is thusly shown to be a broad and smooth phenomenon at
finite parameter values, consistency with notion of self-trapping as a critical

treated as hard-core bosons, the charge q in the associated flux quantum might
be set equal to 2e. Finally, the superconducting transition temperature T_c is
related to D_s linearly, in accordance to the generic Kosterlitz-Thouless type

$D$-dimensional closed manifolds for positive scalar operators $-\Delta +

static Euclidean manifolds, the method is compatible with Lorentzian-time
analytic continuations. It is found that, for $D>1$, the result of the $\zeta$
function procedure is the same obtained from an improved version of the
point-splitting method which uses a particular choice of the term $w_0(x,y)$ in
the Hadamard expansion of the Green function. This point-splitting procedure
works for any value of the field mass $m$. Furthermore, in the case D=4 and
$V(x) = \xi R(x)+ m^2$, the given procedure generalizes the Euclidean version
of Wald's improved point-splitting procedure. The found point-splitting method
should work generally, also dropping the hypothesis of a closed manifold, and
not depending on the $\zeta$-function procedure. This fact is checked in the
Euclidean section of Minkowski spacetime for $A = -\Delta + m^2$ where the
method gives rise to the correct stress tensor for $m^2 \geq 0$ automatically.

spaces is shown. The explicit solutions of these equations possessing a
simplicity and physical transparency are obtained in the form of so-called
""plane waves"" without using the method of separation of variables. The
invariance properties of these ""plane waves"" for the spinless particles under
the group $SO(3,1)$ were used for the construction of the invariant spin~0,1/2
and~1 two-point functions on the $H^3$. Secondly quantized spin~0,1/2 and~1
fields on the ${\Bbb R}^{1}\otimes H^{3}$ are constructed; their propagators
which are their (anti)commutators in different points, are expressed in terms
of the mentioned two-point functions. From here the ${\Bbb R}^{1}\otimes
  SO(3,1)$-invariance follows.

neutralinos to $\tau$-leptons and $b$-quarks. We evaluate the reach of the CERN
LHC $pp$ collider for supersymmetry in the mSUGRA model parameter space. We
find that values of $m_{\tg}\sim 1500-2000$ GeV can be probed with just 10
fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity for $\tan\beta$ values as high as 45, so
that mSUGRA cannot escape the scrutiny of LHC experiments by virtue of having a
large value of $\tan\beta$. We also perform a case study of an mSUGRA model at
$\tan\beta =45$ where $\tz_2\to \tau\ttau_1$ and $\tw_1\to \ttau_1\nu_\tau$
with $\sim 100%$ branching fraction. In this case, at least within our
simplistic study, we show that a di-tau mass edge, which determines the value
of $m_{\tz_2}-m_{\tz_1}$, can still be reconstructed. This information can be
used as a starting point for reconstructing SUSY cascade decays on an
event-by-event basis, and can provide a strong constraint in determining the
underlying model parameters. Finally, we show that for large $\tan\beta$ there
can be an observable excess of $\tau$ leptons, and argue that $\tau$ signals
might serve to provide new information about the underlying model framework.

minimal Standard Model predictions in the matter sector. We only assume the
symmetry breaking pattern of the Standard Model and that new particles are
sufficiently heavy so that the symmetry is non-linearly realized. Models with
dynamical symmetry breaking are generically of this type. We review in the
effective theory language to what extent the simplest models of dynamical
breaking are actually constrained and the assumptions going into the comparison
with experiment. Dynamical symmetry breaking models can be approximated at
intermediate energies by four-fermion operators. We present a complete
classification of the latter when new particles appear in the usual
representations of the $SU(2)_L\times SU(3)_c$ group as well as a partial
classification in the general case. We discuss the accuracy of the four-fermion
description by matching to a simple `fundamental' theory. The coefficients of
the effective lagrangian in the matter sector for dynamical symmetry breaking
models (expressed in terms of the coefficients of the four-quark operators) are
then compared to those of models with elementary scalars (such as the minimal
Standard Model). Contrary to a somewhat widespread belief, we see that the sign
of the vertex corrections is not fixed in dynamical symmetry breaking models.
This work provides the theoretical tools required to analyze, in a rather
general setting, constraints on the matter sector of the Standard Model.

on the novel method of iterated resolvents and on discretized light-cone

provided many insights to the dualities among these theories or even as a tool
to build up dualities since the work of Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow on the
Calabi-Yau case. For M-theory compactified on a Joyce manifold $M^7$, the fact
that $M^7$ is constructed via a generalized Kummer construction on a 7-torus
${\smallBbb T}^7$ with a torsion-free $G_2$-structure $\phi$ suggests that
there are natural fibrations of $M^7$ by ${\smallBbb T}^3$, ${\smallBbb T}^4$,
and K3 surfaces in a way governed by $\phi$. The local picture of some of these
fibrations and their roles in dualities between string/M-theory have been
studied intensively in the work of Acharya. In this present work, we explain
how one can understand their global and topological details in terms of bundles
over orbifolds. After the essential background is provided in Sec. 1, we give
general discussions in Sec. 2 about these fibrations, their generic and
exceptional fibers, their monodromy, and the base orbifolds. Based on these,
one obtains a 5-step-routine to understand the fibrations, which we illustrate
by examples in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4, we turn to another kind of fibrations for
Joyce manifolds, namely the fibrations by the Calabi-Yau threefolds constructed
by Borcea and Voisin. All these fibrations arise freely and naturally from the
work of Joyce. Understanding how the global structure of these fibrations may
play roles in string/M-theory duality is one of the major issues for further
pursuit.

covariant gauge it yields the Donaldson-Witten TQFT. The theory is formulated
on a generalized phase space where a simplectic structure is introduced. The
Hamiltonian is expressed as the anticommutator of off-shell nilpotent BRST and
anti-BRST charges. Following original ideas of Witten a time reversal operation
is introduced and an inner product is defined in terms of it. A non-covariant
gauge fixing is presented giving rise to a manifestly time reversal invariant
Lagrangean and a positive definite Hamiltonian, with the inner product
previously introduced. As a consequence, the indefiniteness problem of some of
the kinetic terms of the Witten's action is resolved. The construction allows
then a consistent interpretation of Floer groups in terms of the cohomology of
the BRST charge which is explicitly independent of the background metric.
  The relation between the BRST cohomology and the ground states of the
Hamiltonian is then completely stablished. The topological theories arising
from the covariant, Donaldson-Witten, and non-covariant gauge fixing are shown
to be quantum equivalent by using the operatorial approach.

\bar\delta(\beta), is used to study properties of patterns generated in the
Swift-Hohenberg equation (SHE). It is shown to be an intensive,
configuration-independent measure. The evolution of random initial states under
the SHE exhibits two stages of relaxation. The initial phase, where local
striped domains emerge from a noisy background, is quantified by a power law
decay \bar\delta(\beta) \sim t^{-{1/2} \beta}. Beyond a sharp transition a
slower power law decay of \bar\delta(\beta), which corresponds to the
coarsening of striped domains, is observed. The transition between the phases
advances as the system is driven further from the onset of patterns, and
suitable scaling of time and \bar\delta(\beta) leads to the collapse of
distinct curves. The decay of $\bar\delta(\beta)$ during the initial phase
remains unchanged when nonvariational terms are added to the underlying
equations, suggesting the possibility of observing it in experimental systems.
In contrast, the rate of relaxation during domain coarsening increases with the
coefficient of the nonvariational term.

nonlinear sources. We show that the system exhibits burst waves which are
periodic in a traveling-wave reference frame. We demonstrate that the burst
waves are pinned if the diffusive coupling is below a critical value. When the
coupling crosses the critical value the system undergoes a depinning
instability via a saddle-node bifurcation, and the wave begins to move. We
obtain the universal scaling for the mean wave velocity just above threshold.

Dubetsky and G. Grynberg, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 46}, 1426 (1992)] and the
collective atomic recoil laser (CARL) [ R. Bonifacio and L. De Salvo, Nucl.
Instrum. Methods A {\bf 341}, 360 (1994)] are compared. Both theories can be
used to derive expressions for the gain experienced by a probe field
interacting with an ensemble of two-level atoms that are simultaneously driven
by a pump field. It is shown that the RIR and CARL formalisms are equivalent.
Differences between the RIR and CARL arise because the theories are typically
applied for different ranges of the parameters appearing in the theory. The RIR
limit considered in this paper is $qP_{0}/M\omega_{q}\gg 1$, while the CARL
limit is $qP_{0}/M\omega_{q}\lesssim 1$, where $% q $ is the magnitude of the
difference of the wave vectors of the pump and probe fields, $P_{0}$ is the
width of the atomic momentum distribution and $% \omega_{q}$ is a recoil
frequency. The probe gain for a probe-pump detuning equal to zero is analyzed
in some detail, in order to understand how the gain arises in a system which,
at first glance, might appear to have vanishing gain. Moreover, it is shown
that the calculations, carried out in perturbation theory have a range of
applicability beyond the recoil problem. Experimental possibilities for
observing CARL are discussed.
