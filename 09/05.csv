in a broad band filter (F606W or F707W, roughly equivalent to V or R-band), for
2 orbits each. We find that on the scale of the HST observations there is a
wide variety of morphological structures of the hosting galaxies: most objects
have a clumpy, irregular appearance, consisting of a bright nucleus and a
number of smaller components, suggestive of merging systems. Some observed
structures could be due (at least partly) to the presence of dust distributed
through the galaxies. The UV continuum emission is generally elongated and
aligned with the axis of the radio sources, however the characteristics of the
``alignment effect'' differ from case to case, suggesting that the phenomenon
cannot be explained by a single physical mechanism. We compare the properties
of our radio galaxies with those of the
  UV dropout galaxies and conclude that (i) the most massive radio galaxies may
well evolve from an aggregate of UV dropout galaxies and (ii) high redshift
radio galaxies probably evolve into present day brightest cluster galaxies.

emission-line disks or filaments are (as a rule) associated with dust

the origin of this ionized gas is generally not through ``cooling flows'';
galaxy interactions are favored instead.
  Using data from a new spectrophotometric survey of ``normal'' elliptical

ellipticals is found to be --without exception-- of the LINER class, and most
probably NOT powered by star formation activity. I discuss two independent
pieces of evidence which suggest that the extended gas in giant ellipticals is
ionized by means of a distributed source of ionization: (i) A significant
correlation exists between the H-alpha+[NII]luminosity and the optical
luminosity within the region occupied by the ionized gas, and (ii) the
ionization parameter of the gas does not change significantly with
galactocentric radius. Two potential sources of ionization are evaluated:
Photoionization by old hot stars (of post-AGB and/or AGB-Manque' type) and
mechanical energy flux from electron conduction in hot, X-ray-emitting gas.

reionized when the number of photons emitted above 1 ryd in one recombination

formalism. Several possible formalisms are known, defined by different
definitions of event and by different selection criteria for sets of histories.
These formalisms have a natural interpretation, according to which nature
somehow chooses one set of histories from among those allowed, and then
randomly chooses to realise one history from that set; other interpretations
are possible, but their scientific implications are essentially the same.
  The selection criteria proposed to date are reasonably natural, and certainly
raise new questions. For example, the validity of ordering inferences which we
normally take for granted --- such as that a particle in one region is
necessarily in a larger region containing it --- depends on whether or not our
history respects the criterion of ordered consistency, or merely consistency.
  However, the known selection criteria, including consistency and medium
decoherence, are very weak. It is not possible to derive the predictions of
classical mechanics or Copenhagen quantum mechanics from the theories they
define, even given observational data in an extended time interval. Attempts to
refine the consistent histories approach so as to solve this problem by finding
a definition of quasiclassicality have so far not succeeded.
  On the other hand, it is shown that dynamical collapse models, of the type
originally proposed by Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber, can be re-interpreted as set
selection criteria within a quantum histories framework, in which context they
appear as candidate solutions to the set selection problem. This suggests a new
route to relativistic generalisation of these models, since covariant
definitions of a quantum event are known.

such that the matching between the effective (low energy) and complete (high
energy) one-loop theories contains no thresholds. We find that for any value of
$\phi_c$, there is a convenient scale $\mu^*\equiv\min_i\{M_i(\phi_c)\}$, at
which the loop expansion has the best behaviour and the effective potential has
the least $\mu$-dependence. Furthermore, at this scale the effective potential
coincides with the (improved) tree-level one in the effective field theory. The
decoupling method is explicitly illustrated with a simple Higgs-Yukawa model,
along with its relationship with other decoupling prescriptions and with
proposed multi-scale renormalization approaches. The procedure leads to a nice
suppression of potentially large logarithms and can be easily adapted to
include higher-loop effects, which is explicitly shown at the two-loop level.

the reliable exposure of Hagedorn physics on the supergravity side, and the
system does not allow the study of the Hagedorn scale by low-temperature field
theories. These results are obtained following some heuristic assumptions on
the character of stringy modifications to the gravitational backgrounds. A rich
phenomenology appears on the supergravity side, with different string
backgrounds dominating in different regions, which should have field-theoretic
consequences. Six-dimensional world volumes turn out to be borderline cases
from several points of view. For lower dimensional world-volumes, a fully

$D_{7,3}$ exceptionals are cousins of the ""$E_6$"" and ""$E_8$"" exceptionals in
the A-D-E classification for affine $A_1$, while the level 2 exceptionals are
related to the lattice invariants of affine u(1).

"math/9809021","Bogdan Ion","S. Caenepeel, B. Ion, G. Militaru, S. Zhu","Separable functors for Doi-Hopf modules. Applications","39 pages",,,,"math.QA math.RA",,"  There are theorems in the literature which are referred as Maschke type
theorems, because of the attempt to generalize Maschke's classical theorem. Our
remark is that all these theorems are in fact providing sufficient conditions
for the separability of a certain forgetful functor. But, unlike classical
Maschke's theorem, where the sufficient condition is also necessary, none of
these theorems gives any necessary condition for the separability of the
forgeful functor in question. Our job is to find a necessary and sufficient
condition for the separability of the forgetful functor from the category of
Doi-Hopf modules forgetting the comodule structure. As in the classical case,
this functor is separable iff exists a certain ""integral map"" with a
normalizing property. As particular cases, improved versions of ""Maschke type""
theorems are given. Other various applications are given. For example, keeping
in mind that the category of Yetter-Drinfel'd modules is also a category of
Doi-Hopf modules, we obtain the notion of quantum integral. For H a finite
dimensional Hopf algebra, the existence of such a quantum integral is a
necessary and sufficient condition for the Drinfel'd double to be a separable
extension of H.

Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 388 (1996)] that a dynamical suppression of
spontaneous emission can occur in a three-level system when an external field
drives transitions between a metastable state and {\em two} decaying states.
What is unusual in the decay scheme is that the decaying states are coupled
directly by the vacuum radiation field. It is shown that decay dynamics
required for total suppression of spontaneous emission necessarily implies that
the level scheme is isomorphic to a three-level lambda system, in which the
lower two levels are {\em both} metastable, and each is coupled to the decaying
state. As such, the total suppression of spontaneous emission can be explained
in terms of conventional dark states and coherent population trapping.

includes the effects of transitions between the two energy levels to all orders
in the non-adiabatic coupling. The problem of determining all non-adiabatic
corrections is reduced to solving an ordinary differential equation to which
numerical methods should provide solutions in a variety of situations. We apply
our method to a particular example that can be realized as a magnetic resonance
experiment, thus raising the possibility of testing our results in the lab.

source with entropy rate less than the capacity may be transmitted with high
entanglement fidelity. We also show that a restricted class of encodings is
sufficient to transmit any quantum source which may be transmitted on a given
channel. This enables us to simplify a known upper bound for the channel
capacity. It also enables us to show that the availability of an auxiliary
classical channel from encoder to decoder does not increase the quantum
capacity.

  corrections and clarifications",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We discuss the conditions under which identical particles may yet be
distinguishable and the relationship between particle permutation and exchange.
We show that we can always define permutation-symmetric state vectors. When the
particles are completely indistinguishable, then exchange is equivalent to
permutation and therefore the exchange eigenvalue for such
permutation-symmetric state vectors is always +1. Exchange asymmetry arises
when the particles are physically distinguishable, even though otherwise
identical, and can be computed from the transformations that arise when the
distinguishing features are reversed.
  There is a fundamental spatial asymmetry between the relative orientations of
any two vectors in a common frame of reference that persists even in the limit
that the vectors coincide. For a pair of particles this asymmetry between their
spin quantization frames renders them distinguishable even when otherwise
identical. In the conventional construction, this distinction is not properly
accounted for. Particle exchange is then equivalent to reversing this relative
orientation --- which requires a relative rotation by 2pi on the spin
quantization frame of one particle with respect to the other, thus resulting in
the conventional exchange phase.
