radio emitting clouds from the high energy source GRS 1915+105. These events
are all consistent with anti-parallel ejections of twin pairs of clouds moving
away from the compact source at $\sim$ 0.92 of the speed of light and angles of
$\sim$ 70$^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight. The flux ratios and time
evolution of the expelled clouds are consistent with actual motions of the
radiating matter rather than with the simple propagation of pulses in a medium
moving at slower velocities. The large kinetic power of the sudden, short, and
rather discontinuous ejections exceeds by more than an order of magnitude the
maximum steady photon luminosity of the source, suggesting that in GRS 1915+105
a radiation acceleration mechanism of the ejecta is unlikely. As in other
galactic and extragalactic radio sources, the decrease in flux density as a
function of angular separation from the central source shows a steepening with
distance. Additional ejection events have been observed in 1995 and 1997 and we
compare them with the 1994 events.

the missing beryllium neutrinos of the Sun roots in the fact that the
SuperKamiokande contains a term arising from a non-pp,CNO source. First
principle physics shows that the non-pp,CNO source is of thermonuclear runaway
origin. Several indications suggest that the non-pp,CNO term plays a more
significant role in the solar neutrino problems than neutrino oscillations.
When removing the over-restricted SSM luminosity constraint, the temperature
dependence of the neutrino fluxes is related to pure nuclear physics and
follows $\Phi_{pp} \propto T^4$ instead of $\Phi_{pp} \propto T^{-1/2}$. The
results of the calculations offer solutions to the solar neutrino problems and
problems of neutrino oscillations. The dynamic solar model presents predictions
to Borexino and SNO measurements. These predictions can serve to distinguish
between the MSW and the non-pp,CNO effect.

reddening vector. A component of this slope is due to differential reddening,
but part is intrinsic. The blue horizontal branch stars are more centrally
concentrated than the red clump stars. We have discovered about 50 new variable
stars near NGC 6441, among them eight or more RR Lyrae stars which are very
probably cluster members. Comprehensive period searches over the range 0.2-1.0
days yielded unusually long periods (0.5-0.9 days) for the fundamental
pulsators compared with field RR Lyrae of the same metallicity. Three similar
long-period RR Lyrae are known in other metal-rich globulars. With over ten
examples in hand, it seems that a distinct sub-class of RR Lyrae is emerging.
The observed properties of the horizontal branch stars are in reasonable
agreement with recent models which invoke deep mixing to enhance the
atmospheric helium abundance, while they conflict with models which assume high
initial helium abundance. The light curves of the c-type RR Lyrae seem to have
unusually long rise times and sharp minima. Reproducing these light curves in
stellar pulsation models may provide another means of constraining the physical
variables responsible for the anomalous blue horizontal branch extension and
sloped red clump observed in NGC 6441.

implodes to a black hole. This may be the baryon--cleanest environment proposed
so far, because the SN explosion in which the SMNS formed swept the medium
surrounding the remnant, and the quickly spinning remnant loses energy through
magnetic dipole radiation at a rate exceeding its Eddington luminosity by some
four orders of magnitude. The implosion is adiabatic because neutrinos have
short mean free paths, and silent, given the prompt collapse of the polar caps.
However, a mass ~ 0.1 M_solar in the equatorial belt can easily reach
centrifugal equilibrium. The mechanism of energy extraction is via the
conversion of the Poynting flux (due to the large--scale magnetic field locked
into the minitorus) into a magnetized relativistic wind. Occasionally this

that the chemistry has been significantly changed by the shock. The existence
of significant column densities of both OH and H2O, which is at odds with

photodissociation of H2O or a mix of fast and slow shocks through regions with

intense bursts of star formation on high surface brightness galaxies, few
attempts have been made to understand how localized starbursts would affect
both the color and surface brightness of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies.
To remedy this, we have run 53 simulations involving bursts of star formation
activity on LSB galaxies, varying both the underlying galaxy properties and the
parameters describing the starbursts. We discovered that although changing the
total color of a galaxy was fairly straightforward, it was virtually impossible
to alter a galaxy's central surface brightness and thereby remove it from the
LSB galaxy classification without placing a high (and fairly artificial)
threshold for the underlying gas density. The primary effect of large amounts
of induced star formation was to produce a centralized core (bulge) component
which is generally not observed in LSB galaxies. The noisy morphological
appearance of LSB galaxies as well as their noisy surface brightness profiles
can be reproduced by considering small bursts of star formation that are
localized within the disk. The trigger mechanism for such bursts is likely
distant/weak tidal encounters. The stability of disk central surface brightness
to these periods of star formation argues that the large space density of LSB
galaxies at z = 0 should hold to substantially higher redshifts.

involving both Monte Carlo simulations and beam tests of alternative beam-stop

from the beam stop and the resulting hit rates in detectors, while preserving
maximum acceptance for events of interest. The beam tests consisted of
measurements of rates in drift chambers, scintilation counter hodoscopes, a gas
threshold Cherenkov counter, and a lead glass array. Measurements were also
made with a set of specialized detectors which were sensitive to low-energy
neutrons, photons, and charged particles. Comparisons are made between these

present a recently suggested way on how to analytically incorporate massive
threshold effects into observables calculated in massless QCD. No matching is
required since the renormalization scale is in this approach connected to the
physical momentum transfer between static quarks in a color singlet state. We
discuss massive fermionic corrections to the heavy quark potential through two
loops. The calculation uses a mixed approach of analytical, computer-algebraic
and numerical tools including Monte Carlo integration of finite terms. Strong
consistency checks are performed by ensuring the proper cancellation of all
non-local divergences by the appropriate counterterms and by comparing with the
massless limit. The size of the effect for the (gauge invariant) fermionic part
of $\alpha_V ({\bf q^2},m^2) $ relative to the massless case at the charm and
bottom flavor thresholds is found to be of order 33%.

previous article, dg-ga/9710032, we proved transversality using an extension of
the holonomy-perturbation methods of Donaldson, Floer, and Taubes, together
with the existence of an Uhlenbeck compactification for the perturbed moduli
space. However, it remained an important and interesting question to see
whether there were simpler, more intrinsic alternatives to the holonomy
perturbations and this is the issue we settle here. The idea that PU(2)
monopoles might lead to a proof of Witten's conjecture (hep-th/9411102,
hep-th/9709193) concerning the relation between the two types of four-manifold
invariants was first proposed by Pidstrigach and Tyurin in 1994
(dg-ga/9507004): the space of PU(2) monopoles contains the moduli space of
anti-self-dual connections together with copies of the various Seiberg-Witten
moduli spaces, these forming singular loci in the higher-dimensional space of
PU(2) monopoles. Results in this direction, due to the author and Leness, are
surveyed in dg-ga/9709022, with a detailed account appearing in dg-ga/9712005.
Our transversality theorem ensures that the anti-self-dual and Seiberg-Witten
loci are the only singularities and that the PU(2) monopole moduli space forms
a smooth - though non-compact, because of bubbling - cobordism between the
links of the singularities.

is the result of the interaction of that matter with a newly defined additional
field called the Higgs Field after its principle researcher. Stated briefly,
the Higgs field mechanism endows ""gauge bosons"" in a ""gauge theory"" with mass,
through absorption of ""Nambu-Goldstone bosons"" arising in spontaneous ""symmetry

  Present physics theory deems that the gravitational mass characteristic of
matter is the result of that matter ""curving"" or ""warping"" space and time
according to the matter's presence through a mechanism not yet discovered nor
defined.
  Present physics recognizes that inertial mass and gravitational mass are
equal as an empirical fact based on highly precise experiments. But, for
example, the Earth in its orbit around the Sun experiences attraction toward
the Sun involving its gravitational mass, mg, and simultaneously experiences
that attraction balanced by Earth's orbital centripetal force involving its
inertial mass, mi.
  G M mg / r^2 = mi v^2 / r
  That the matter of planet Earth is being endowed ""gauge theory bosons with
mass through absorption of Nambu-Goldstone bosons symmetry breaking in a Higgs
Field"" while simultaneously ""warping or curving its region of space"" is beyond
the unreasonable and is simply inconceivable.

to the Einstein opinion combined with the substantial other successes and
reputation or Einstein. It was not a victory of solid reasoning nor
demonstrated factual evidence. Now solid reasoning and new data not available
to Einstein and Lorentz show that Lorentz was correct and that Einstein's
Theory of Relativity should correctly be termed Einstein's Principle of
Invariance. It is shown that Einstein's comprehensive relativity and denial of
an absolute frame of reference for the universe are incorrect and that the
universe has an absolute universal prime frame of reference. The significance
