variables. The fast variables are the populations of the species and slow
variables the links of a directed graph that defines the catalytic interactions
among them. The graph evolves via mutations of the least fit species. Starting
from a sparse random graph, we find that an autocatalytic set (ACS) inevitably
appears and triggers a cascade of exponentially increasing connectivity until
it spans the whole graph. The connectivity subsequently saturates in a
statistical steady state. The time scales for the appearance of an ACS in the
graph and its growth have a power law dependence on $s$ and the catalytic
probability. At the end of the growth period the network is highly non-random,
being localized on an exponentially small region of graph space for large $s$.

1399's luminosity function is also very similar to that of M 87, and comparing
their respective peak magnitudes indicates that the Fornax cluster is at very
nearly the same distance from the Local Group as is the Virgo cluster. From

effects of random errors. The number of unresolved objects we find at a
projected distance of 440 kpc from NGC 1399 is consistent with nothing more
than compact background galaxies, though the small field of view of the WFPC2

emission line galaxy, all in the Coma cluster. E+A galaxies lacking narrow
emission lines have 2.2$\mu$m to 12$\mu$m flux density ratios or limits similar
to old stellar populations (typical of early-type galaxies). Only galaxies with
emission lines have enhanced 12$\mu$m flux density. Excess 12$\mu$m emission is
therefore correlated with the presence of on-going star formation or an active
galactic nucleus (AGN).
  By comparing the current star formation rates with previous rates estimated
from the Balmer absorption features, we divide the galaxies into two groups:
those for which star formation has declined significantly following a dramatic
peak $\sim$ 1 Gyr ago; and those with a significant level of ongoing star
formation or/and an AGN. There is no strong difference in the spatial
distribution on the sky between these two groups. However, the first group has
systemic velocities above the mean cluster value and the second group below
that value. This suggests that the two groups differ kinematically.
  Based on surveys of the Coma cluster in the radio, the IRAS sources, and
galaxies detected in H$\alpha$ emission, we sum the far infrared luminosity
function of galaxies in the cluster. We find that star formation in late type
galaxies is probably the dominant component of the Coma cluster far infrared
luminosity. The presence of significant emission from intracluster dust is not
yet firmly established. The member galaxies also account for most of the far
infrared output from nearby rich clusters in general.

hydrodynamic elements of cosmological simulations which are known to cause the

collapse, cooling flow model, drag, a cosmological simulation, rotating
cloud-collapse and disc stability. In the implementations special attention is
given to the way in which force symmetry is enforced in the equations of
motion. We study in detail how the hydrodynamics are affected by different
implementations of the artificial viscosity including those with a
shear-correction modification. We present an improved first-order
smoothing-length update algorithm that is designed to remove instabilities that
are present in the Hernquist and Katz (1989) algorithm.
  For all tests we find that the artificial viscosity is the most important
factor distinguishing the results from the various implementations. The second
most important factor is the way force symmetry is achieved in the equation of
motion. Most results favour a kernel symmetrization approach. The exact method
by which SPH pressure forces are included has comparatively little effect on
the results. Combining the equation of motion presented in Thomas and Couchman

Lower Centaurus Crux of Sco OB2, as well as Vel OB2, Tr 10, Col 121, Per OB2,

members, including a significant number of F stars, as well as evolved stars,
e.g., the Wolf-Rayet stars gamma^2 Vel (Vel OB2) and EZ CMa (Col 121), and the
classical Cepheid delta Cep in Cep OB6. In the nearest associations the
later-type members include T Tauri objects and other pre-main sequence stars.
  Astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of R CrA, CMa OB1, Mon
OB1, Ori OB1, Cam OB1, Cep OB3, Cep OB4, Cyg OB4, Cyg OB7, and Sct OB2, is
inconclusive, due to their large distance or unfavorable kinematics.
  The mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smaller
than previous estimates. The mean motions display a systematic pattern, which
is discussed in relation to the Gould Belt. Six of the 12 detected moving
groups do not appear in the classical list of nearby OB associations. The
number of unbound young stellar groups in the Solar neighbourhood may be
significantly larger than thought previously.

equal strength, the zero-coupling critical point and an infinity of critical
line segments constitute the same critical set in the $A-c$ plane,
independently of $N$. However, for any other nonglobal-coupling cases of
shorter-range couplings, the structure of the critical set becomes different
from that for the global-coupling case, because of a significant change in the
stability diagram of periodic orbits born via period doublings. The critical
scaling behaviors on the critical set are also found to be the same as those

limit of the width parameter going to zero. Exact predictions of viscometric
functions in simple shear flow are obtained with the help of a retarded motion
expansion and by Brownian dynamics simulations. It is shown that for relatively
small non-zero values of the width parameter, the presence of excluded volume
causes a swelling of the dumbbell at equilibrium, and shear thinning in simple

not lead to either swelling or to shear thinning. Approximate viscometric

neglected when they participate in more delocalized interblock fluctuations.
Applications to one-dimensional models (Heisenberg, Hubbard and dimerized
tight-binding) show that in this way the involved computer resources can be
reduced without significant loss of accuracy. The efficiency and accuracy of
the method is analyzed by varying $m$ and $p$ and by comparison with standard

Dirac even in 1931, and then from the point of view of the modern theory by
A.M. Polyakov and G.~ 'tHooft in 1974. Numerous and unsuccessful attempts of
experimental search for monopole in cosmic rays and on accelerators in high
energy particle collisions have been done. Also the searches have been carried
out in mica for monopole tracks as well as for relict monopoles, entrapped by
ferromagnetic inclusions in iron-ores, moon rock and meteorites. These
entrapped monopoles, when released, would have the lowest velocities
$\beta<10^{-6}$ and do not yield ionization at all, and are hard to detect.
Therefore it is necessary to examine thoroughly the mechanisms of slow heavy
monopole interaction with matter and their scale of energy loss.
  We discuss here the interaction of a massive slow magnetic monopole with
magnetically ordered matter, with conductors, superconductors and with
condensed matter in general. Our results indicate that the energy loss of a
slow supermassive monopole reach $10^{8} eV/cm$ and more if we take into
consideration the Cherenkov radiation of magnons or phonons and conductivity of
the media. A new method of search for cosmic and relict monopoles by
magnetically ordered film is considered too. This approach resembles the
traditional method of nuclear emulsion chamber. Apparently the proposed method
is particularly attractive for detection of relict monopoles, released from
melting iron ore.

lifetime ($\tau_X \simeq 10^{10}-10^{22} years$) of the $X$ particle to explain
the UHE cosmic rays in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with
massive Majorana neutrinos. We show that there is no anomaly-free discrete
gauge symmetry to make the lifetime of the $X$ particle sufficiently long in
the MSSM with the $X$ particle. We find, however, possible solutions to this
problem especially by enlarging the particle contents in the MSSM. We show a
number of solutions introducing an extra pair of singlets $Y$ and $\bar{Y}$
which have fractional ${\bf Z}_N$ (N=2,3) charges. The present experimental
constraints on the $X$ particle are briefly discussed.

does not rely on low energy supersymmetry or technicolor. The fundamental
Planck mass is at a $\tev$ and the observed weakness of gravity at long
distances is due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In
this picture the standard model fields are localized to a $(3+1)$-dimensional
wall or ``3-brane''. The hierarchy problem becomes isomorphic to the problem of
the largeness of the extra dimensions. This is in turn inextricably linked to
the cosmological constant problem, suggesting the possibility of a common
solution. The radii of the extra dimensions must be prevented from both
expanding to too great a size, and collapsing to the fundamental Planck length
$\tev^{-1}$. In this paper we propose a number of mechanisms addressing this
question. We argue that a positive bulk cosmological constant $\bar\Lambda$ can
stabilize the internal manifold against expansion, and that the value of
$\bar\Lambda$ is not unstable to radiative corrections provided that the
supersymmetries of string theory are broken by dynamics on our 3-brane. We
further argue that the extra dimensions can be stabilized against collapse in a
phenomenologically successful way by either of two methods: 1) Large,
topologically conserved quantum numbers associated with higher-form bulk U(1)
gauge fields, such as the naturally occurring Ramond-Ramond gauge fields, or
the winding number of bulk scalar fields. 2) The brane-lattice-crystallization
of a large number of 3-branes in the bulk. These mechanisms are consistent with
theoretical, laboratory, and cosmological considerations such as the absence of
large time variations in Newton's constant during and after primordial
nucleosynthesis, and millimeter-scale tests of gravity.

the conjugate momentum field is real even in the classically forbidden regions.

psi^D/psi of two real linearly independent solutions of the Schroedinger

connected by a coordinate transformation to the free one with vanishing energy,
univocally leads to the Quantum Stationary HJ Equation (QSHJE). Trajectories
depend on the Planck length through hidden variables which arise as initial
conditions. The formulation has manifest p-q duality, a consequence of the
involutive nature of the Legendre transform and of its recently observed
relation with second-order linear differential equations. This reflects in an
intrinsic psi^D-psi duality between linearly independent solutions of the
Schroedinger equation. Unlike Bohm's theory, there is a non-trivial action even
for bound states. No use of any axiomatic interpretation of the wave-function
is made. Tunnelling is a direct consequence of the quantum potential which
differs from the usual one and plays the role of particle's self-energy. The
QSHJE is defined only if the ratio psi^D/psi is a local self-homeomorphism of
the extended real line. This is an important feature as the L^2 condition,
which in the usual formulation is a consequence of the axiomatic interpretation
of the wave-function, directly follows as a basic theorem which only uses the
geometrical gluing conditions of psi^D/psi at q=\pm\infty as implied by the EP.
As a result, the EP itself implies a dynamical equation that does not require
any further assumption and reproduces both tunnelling and energy quantization.
Several features of the formulation show how the Copenhagen interpretation
hides the underlying nature of QM. Finally, the non-stationary higher
dimensional quantum HJ equation and the relativistic extension are derived.

the 4-fermion Green function a selfconsistent equation is written down in the

chosen reductions of the two-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equations prevents
continuum dissolution in our 3D three-fermion equation. The potentials are
hermitian and depend only slowly on the total three-fermion energy. The one
high-mass limits are approximately exact. In view of a possible perturbation
calculation, correcting the remaining discrepancies with the three-fermion
Bethe-Salpeter equation, we succeeded in deriving our 3D equation from an
approximation of the three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation, in which the
three-body kernel is neglected and the two-body kernels approached by
positive-energy instantaneous expressions, with the spectator fermion on the

both contained uniqueness and existence results in a now standard sense. These
papers served as keystones for two separate theories -- KK-theory and the
classification program -- which for many years parted ways with only moderate
interaction. But recent years have seen a fruitful interaction which has been
one of the main engines behind rapid progress in the classification program.
  In the present paper we take this interaction even further. We prove general
existence and uniqueness results using KK-theory and a concept of
quasidiagonality for representations. These results are employed to obtain new
classification results for certain classes of quasidiagonal C*-algebras
introduced by H. Lin. An important novel feature of these classes is that they
are defined by a certain local approximation property, rather than by an
inductive limit construction.
  Our existence and uniqueness results are in the spirit of classical
Ext-theory. The main complication overcome in the paper is to control the
stabilization which is necessary when one works with finite C*-algebras. In the
infinite case, where programs of this type have already been successfully
carried out, stabilization is unnecessary. Yet, our methods are sufficiently
versatile to allow us to reprove, from a handful of basic results, the
classification of purely infinite nuclear C*-algebras of Kirchberg and
Phillips.
  Indeed, it is our hope that this can be the starting point of a unified
approach to classification of nuclear C*-algebras.

others. A principal result on the subject is Rayleigh's celebrated inflection
point theorem {R80}, which states that for an equilibrium flow to be unstable,
the equilibrium velocity profile must contain an inflection point. That is, if
the velocity profile is given by $U(y)$, where $y$ is the cross-stream
coordinate, then there must be a point, $y=y_I$, for which $U''(y_I)=0$. Much
later, in 1950, Fj{\o}rtoft {F50} generalized the theorem by showing that,
moreover, if there is one inflection point, then $U'''(y_I)/U'(y_I)<0$ is
required for instability (see {Bar} for further extensions). Both Rayleigh's
Theorem and Fj{\o}rtoft's subsequent generalization are necessary conditions
for instability, but they are not sufficient. That is, even though an
equilibrium profile may contain a vorticity minimum, it is not necessarily
unstable. The point of this paper is to derive, for a large class of
equilibrium velocity profiles, a condition that is necessary and sufficient for
instability.

be implemented by applying a low-power, monochromatic radio-frequency field to
one peak of a doublet in a weakly-coupled two-spin system. This is known in NMR
spectroscopy as Pound-Overhauser double resonance. The ``transition''
Hamiltonian that has been associated with this procedure is however only an
approximation, which ignores off-resonance effects and does not correctly
predict the associated phase factors. In this paper, the exact effective
Hamiltonian for evolution of the spins' state in a rotating frame is derived,
both under irradiation of a single peak (on-transition) as well as between the
peaks of the doublet (on-resonance). The accuracy of these effective
Hamiltonians is validated by comparing the observable product operator
components of the density matrix obtained by simulation to those obtained by
fitting the corresponding experiments. It is further shown how both the
on-transition and on-resonance fields can be used to implement the
controlled-NOT gate exactly up to conditional phases, and analytic expressions
for these phases are derived. In Appendices, the on-resonance Hamiltonian is
analytically diagonalized, and proofs are given that, in the weak-coupling
approximation, off-resonance effects can be neglected whenever the
radio-frequency field power is small compared to the difference in resonance
frequencies of the two spins.

observables and the computability of numerical functions is re-examined. A new
formulation is given for the notion of measurability with finite precision in
order to reconcile the conflict alleged by M. A. Nielsen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79,
2915 (1997)] that the measurability of a certain observable contradicts the
Church-Turing thesis. It is argued that any function computable by a quantum
algorithm is a recursive function obeying the Church-Turing thesis, whereas any
observable can be measured in principle.

motion of a trapped atom. The Lamb-Dicke approximation leads to a divergence of
the mean motional excitation in a finite interaction time for k-quantum down
conversions with k>=3, analogous to the situation in the parametric
approximation of nonlinear optics. We show that, in contrast to the Lamb-Dicke
approximation, the correct treatment of the overlap of the atomic
center-of-mass wave function and the driving laser waves leads to a proper
dynamics without any divergence problem. That is, the wavy nature of both
matter and light is an important physical property which cannot be neglected
for describing the motional dynamics of a trapped atom, even for small
Lamb-Dicke parameters.

the phenomenon of squeezing exchange between their internal and motional
degrees of freedom. An interesting relation between the quantum noise reduction
(squeezing) and the dynamical evolution is found when the internal and motional
subsystems are prepared in properly squeezed (intelligent) states.
Specifically, the evolution of the system is fully governed by the relative
strengths of spectroscopic and motional squeezing, including the phenomenon of
total cancellation of the interaction when the initial squeezing parameters are
equal.

coherent cavity field is considered in the framework of the Dicke model. We
focus on the role of collective atomic effects in the phenomenon of collapses
and revivals of the Rabi oscillations. It is shown that the behavior of the
system strongly depends on the initial atomic state. In the case of the initial
half-excited Dicke state we account for a number of interesting phenomena. The
correlations between the atoms result in a suppression of the revival
amplitude, and the revival time is halved, compared to the uncorrelated
fully-excited and ground states. The phenomenon of squeezing of the radiation
field in the atom-field interaction is also discussed. For the initial
fully-excited and ground atomic states, the field is squeezed on the short-time
scale, and squeezing can be enhanced by increasing the number of atoms. Some
empirical formulas are found which describe the behavior of the system in
excellent agreement with numerical results. For the half-excited Dicke state,
the field can be strongly squeezed on the long-time scale in the case of two
atoms. This kind of squeezing is enhanced by increasing the intensity of the
initial coherent field and is of the same nature as revival-time squeezing in
the Jaynes-Cummings model. The appearance of this long-time squeezing can be
explained using the factorization approximation for semiclassical atomic
states.

  reconstruction for physical systems with Lie-group symmetries","REVTeX, 18 pages, no figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.59.971",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a detailed discussion of a general theory of phase-space
distributions, introduced recently by the authors [J. Phys. A {\bf 31}, L9
(1998)]. This theory provides a unified phase-space formulation of quantum
mechanics for physical systems possessing Lie-group symmetries. The concept of
generalized coherent states and the method of harmonic analysis are used to
construct explicitly a family of phase-space functions which are postulated to
satisfy the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence with a generalized traciality
condition. The symbol calculus for the phase-space functions is given by means
of the generalized twisted product. The phase-space formalism is used to study
the problem of the reconstruction of quantum states. In particular, we consider
the reconstruction method based on measurements of displaced projectors, which
comprises a number of recently proposed quantum-optical schemes and is also
related to the standard methods of signal processing. A general group-theoretic
description of this method is developed using the technique of harmonic
expansions on the phase space.
