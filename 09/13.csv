cluster potentials is unable to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity-
temperature relation of groups of galaxies. As an alternative, we construct a
physically motivated model for the adiabatic collapse of pre-heated gas into an
isothermal potential that improves upon the original work of Kaiser (1991). The
luminosity and temperature of the gas is calculated, assuming an appropriate
distribution of halo formation times and radiation due to both bremsstrahlung
and recombination processes. This model successfully reproduces the slope and
dispersion of the luminosity-temperature relation of galaxy groups. We also
present calculations of the temperature and luminosity functions for galaxy
groups under the prescription of this model. This model makes two strong
predictions for haloes with total masses M<10^13 M_sun, which are not yet
testable with current data: (1) the gas mass fraction will increase in direct
proportion to the halo mass; (2) the gas temperature will be larger than the
virial temperature of the mass. The second effect is strong enough that group
masses determined from gas temperatures will be overestimated by about an order
of magnitude if it is assumed that the gas temperature is the virial
temperature. The entropy required to match observations can be obtained by
heating the gas at the turnaround time, for example, to about 3 X 10^6 K at
z=1, which is too high to be generated by a normal rate of supernova
explosions. This model breaks down on the scale of low mass clusters, but this
is an acceptable limitation, as we expect accretion shocks to contribute
significantly to the entropy of the gas in such objects.

  available at http://astro.stanford.edu/jeffw",,"10.1086/307108",,"astro-ph",,"  The first results from a Tully-Fisher (TF) survey of cluster galaxies are
presented. The galaxies are drawn from fifteen Abell clusters that lie in the
redshift range 9000-12,000 km/sec and are distributed uniformly around the
celestial sky. The data set consists of R-band CCD photometry and long- slit
H-alpha spectroscopy. The rotation curves (RCs) are characterized by a turnover
radius (r_t) and an asymptotic velocity v_a, while the surface brightness
profiles are characterized in terms of an effective exponential surface
brightness I_e and a scale length r_e. The TF scatter is minimized when the
rotation velocity is measured at 2.0 +/- 0.2 r_e; a significantly larger
scatter results when the rotation velocity is measured at > 3 or < 1.5 scale
lengths. This effect demonstrates that RCs do not have a universal form, as has
been suggested by Persic, Salucci, and Stel. In contrast to previous studies, a
modest but statistically significant surface-brightness dependence of the TF
relation is found, log v = const + 0.28*log L + 0.14*log I_e. This indicates a
stronger parallel between the TF relation and the FP relations of elliptical
galaxies than has previously been recognized. Future papers in this series will
consider the implications of this cluster sample for deviations from Hubble
flow on 100-200 Mpc scales.

lead to a large number of exponentially narrow resonances when the opening is

random matrix theory prediction. The distribution of resonance widths and the
probability to remain are quantitatively given in terms of only the stability
matrix of the orbit on which the opening is placed. The long-time remaining
probability density is non-trivially distributed over the available phase
space; it can be enhanced or suppressed near orbits other than the one on which
the lead is located, depending on the periods and classical actions of these
other orbits. These effects of the short periodic orbits on quantum decay rates
have no classical counterpart, and first appear on times scales much larger

number of groups. Here we present an additional model which specifically
includes an evolution equation for the lubricant excreted by the bacteria. We
show that when the diffusion of the fluid is governed by nonlinear diffusion
coefficient branching patterns evolves. We study the effect of the rates of

results are compared with experimental observations. We also include fields of

The complexity of the algorithm is quadratic in the product of the word length
and the number of the singular generators in the word. Furthermore we
algebraically reprove a result of Fenn, Keyman and Rourke that the monoid
embeds into a group and we compute the cohomological dimension of this group.

  Review A","Phys.Rev. A59 (1999) 3959","10.1103/PhysRevA.59.3959",,"quant-ph",,"  This paper develops a method of manipulating the squeezed atom state to
generate a few-photon state whose phase or photon-number fluctuations are
prescribed at our disposal. The squeezed atom state is a collective atomic
state whose quantum fluctuations in population difference or collective dipole
are smaller than those of the coherent atom state. It is shown that the
squeezed atom state can be generated by the interaction of atoms with a
coherent state of the electromagnetic field, and that it can be used as a
tunable source of squeezed radiation. A variety of squeezed states, including
the photon-number squeezed state and the phase squeezed state, can be produced
by manipulating the atomic state. This is owing to the fact that
quantum-statistical information of the atomic state is faithfully transferred
to that of the photon state. Possible experimental situations to implement our
theory are discussed.

of the radiant energy characterized by a frequency, in addition to the usual
relativistic transformation rules leading to the wave-particle duality, we
investigate the case in which this frequency is an internal propery of the
particle. This kind of interpretation of the frequency is shown to be relevant
to the tunneling effect. The investigations in this direction yield (1) a
purely real time everywhere, (2) an anti-hermitian momentum operator, (3) a
corpuscular structure for the particle, and (4) all of the known theoretical
predictions about the tunneling effect.
