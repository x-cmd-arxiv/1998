variables (MCVs) has been a powerful technique for determining the structure of
the accretion zones on the white dwarf. Until now, this has been achieved by
constructing emission regions (for example arcs and spots) put in by hand, in
order to recover the polarized emission. These models were all inferred
indirectly from arguments based on polarization and X-ray light curves. Potter,
Hakala & Cropper (1998) presented a technique (Stokes imaging) which
objectively and analytically models the polarized emission to recover the
structure of the cyclotron emission region(s) in MCVs. We demonstrate this
technique with the aid of a test case, then we apply the technique to
polarimetric observations of the AM Her system V347 Pav. As the system
parameters of V347 Pav (for example its inclination) have not been well
determined, we describe an extension to the Stokes imaging technique which also
searches the system parameter space (GOSSIP).

per day was detected over the whole three-year time span. In the outer solar
system (outside about 2.6 AU) they are mostly of interstellar origin, whereas
in the inner solar system they are mostly interplanetary particles. Within
about 1.7 AU from Jupiter intense streams of small dust particles were detected
with impact rates of up to 20,000 per day whose impact directions are
compatible with a Jovian origin. Two different populations of dust particles
were detected in the Jovian magnetosphere: small stream particles during
Galileo's approach to the planet and big particles concentrated closer to
Jupiter between the Galilean satellites. There is strong evidence that the dust
stream particles are orders of magnitude smaller in mass and faster than the
instrument's calibration, whereas the calibration is valid for the big
particles. Because the data transmission rate was very low, the complete data

purely by observational errors. Using recently available age estimates for
nearby early type galaxies, we show that a galaxy's position relative to the FP
depends on its age. In particular, the mean FP corresponds to ellipticals with
an age of ~10 Gyr. Younger galaxies are systematically brighter with higher
surface brightness relative to the mean relation. Old ellipticals form an
`upper envelope' to the FP. For our sample of mostly non-cluster galaxies, age
can account for almost half of the scatter in the B band FP. Distance
determinations based on the FP may have a systematic bias, if the mean age of
the sample varies with redshift.
  We also show that fundamental plane residuals, B-V colors and Mg_2 line
strength are consistent with an ageing central burst superposed on an old
stellar population. This reinforces the view that these age estimates are
tracing the last major episode of star formation induced by a gaseous merger
event. We briefly discuss the empirical `evolutionary tracks' of
merger-remnants and young ellipticals in terms of their key observational

the surface mass density, $P$ is the vertically integrated pressure, and
$\Gamma$ is the adiabatic index. We consider in detail the special case where
there is a local maximum in the disk entropy profile $S(r)$. This maximum acts
to trap the waves in its vicinity if its height to width ratio ${\rm
max}(S)/\Delta r$ is larger than a threshold value. The pressure gradient
derived from this entropy variation provides the restoring force for the wave
growth. We show that the trapped waves act to transport angular momentum
outward. A plausible way to produce an entropy variation is when an accretion
disk is starting from negligible mass and temperature, therefore negligible
entropy. As mass accumulates by either tidal torquing, magnetic torquing, or
Roche-lobe overflow, confinement of heat will lead to an entropy maximum at the
outer boundary of the disk. Possible nonlinear developments from this
instability include the formation of Rossby vortices and the formation of
spiral shocks. What remains to be determined from hydrodynamic simulations is
whether or not Rossby wave packets (or vortices) ``hold together'' as they
propagate radially inward.

to an additional reduction of the intrinsic interfacial width and an increase
of the effective interfacial tension upon decreasing the film thickness. These

self-consistent field calculations. Taking account of the thickness dependence

problem in this class is as follows: Given an undirected graph and two
minimization objectives (under different cost functions), with a budget
specified on the first, find a <subgraph \from a given subgraph-class that
minimizes the second objective subject to the budget on the first. We consider
three different criteria - the total edge cost, the diameter and the maximum
degree of the network. Here, we present the first polynomial-time approximation
algorithms for a large class of bicriteria network design problems for the
above mentioned criteria. The following general types of results are presented.
  First, we develop a framework for bicriteria problems and their
approximations. Second, when the two criteria are the same %(note that the cost
functions continue to be different) we present a ``black box'' parametric
search technique. This black box takes in as input an (approximation) algorithm
for the unicriterion situation and generates an approximation algorithm for the
bicriteria case with only a constant factor loss in the performance guarantee.
Third, when the two criteria are the diameter and the total edge costs we use a
cluster-based approach to devise a approximation algorithms --- the solutions
output violate both the criteria by a logarithmic factor. Finally, for the
class of treewidth-bounded graphs, we provide pseudopolynomial-time algorithms
for a number of bicriteria problems using dynamic programming. We show how
these pseudopolynomial-time algorithms can be converted to fully
polynomial-time approximation schemes using a scaling technique.

variation in network bandwidth constraints. An attractive solution to this

paper, we consider two such mechanisms for the support of video multicast; one
is a rate-based mechanism that relies on explicit rate congestion feedback from
the network, and the other is a credit-based mechanism that relies on
hop-by-hop congestion feedback. The responsiveness, bandwidth utilization,
scalability and fairness of the two mechanisms are evaluated through
simulations. Results suggest that while the two mechanisms exhibit performance
trade-offs, both are capable of providing a high quality video service in the

For $\ntc=4$, discovery of the $\pzero$ at an $\epem$ collider via the reaction
$\epem\to\gam \pzero$ should be possible as long as $\mpzero$ is not near
$\mz$. In the $\gam\gam$ collider mode of operation at an $\epem$ collider, the
$\gam\gam\to\pzero\to b\anti b$ signal should be very robust if $\ntc=4$. For
the minimal $\ntc=1$ case, detection of the $\pzero$ at the Tevatron and in
$\epem$ collisions will be very difficult, and the precision of measurements at
the LHC and the $\gam\gam$ collider decline markedly. A $\mupmum$ collider
yields a $\pzero$ production rate that does not depend markedly upon $\ntc$. At
a $\mupmum$ collider discovery of the $\pzero$ as an $s$-channel resonance
should prove possible via scanning, even if it has not already been detected
elsewhere. Once $\mpzero$ is precisely known, operation of the $\mupmum$
collider as a $\pzero$ factory will allow precision measurements of enough
observables to determine the number of technicolors of the theory and (up to a
discrete set of ambiguities) the fundamental parameters of the low-energy
effective Lagrangian describing the Yukawa couplings of the $\pzero$.

the following two-dimensional examples: the uniformly random spanning tree on

lengths), and the Euclidean minimal spanning tree on a Poisson process of
points in $\R^2$ with density $\delta^{-2}$. In each case, sample trees are
proven to have the following properties, with probability one with respect to
any of the limiting measures: i) there is a single route to infinity (as was
known for $\delta > 0$), ii) the tree branches are given by curves which are
regular in the sense of H\""older continuity, iii) the branches are also rough,

points. The geometrization still makes sense and yields a deformation. The
effectivity of deformations arisen in this manner will be locally described in
the existing deformation theory of hyperbolic structures when n-3 = 2, 3.

with numerical examples as well as an exactly solvable model, our method can
converge to the desired answer at a rate which is orders of magnitude faster

opacity and duration of emission of the source created in any non-central high
energy nuclear collisions. The behavior of the physical quantities with
centrality of the collisions is discussed --- in particular changes caused by a
possible phase transition to a quark-gluon plasma.

quantum information theory. Unfortunately, there is an apparent mismatch
between the intuitive and rigorous definitions of distillable entanglement. To
be precise, the existing rigorous definitions impose the constraint that the
distilation protocol produce an output of constant dimension. It is therefore
conceivable that this unnecessary constraint might have led to underestimation
of the true distillable entanglement. We give a new definition of distillable
entanglement which removes this constraint, but could conceivably overestimate
the true value. Since the definitions turn out to be equivalent, neither
underestimation nor overestimation is possible, and both definitions are
arguably correct
