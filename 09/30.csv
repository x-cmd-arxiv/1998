a careful accounting of the degrees of freedom in covariant gravitational
instability theory, we show that the evolution of structure is completely
specified by the stress history of the dark sector. The study of smooth,
entropic, sonic, scalar anisotropic, vector anisotropic, and tensor anisotropic
stresses reveals the origin, robustness, and uniqueness of specific model
phenomenology. We construct useful and illustrative analytic solutions that
cover cases with multiple species of differing equations of state relevant to
the current generation of models, especially those with effectively smooth
components. We present a simple case study of models with phenomenologies
similar to that of a LambdaCDM model to highlight reverse-engineering issues. A
critical-density universe dominated by a single type of dark matter with the
appropriate stress history can mimic a LambdaCDM model exactly.

MG1131+0456, which show that its lens galaxy is an H=18.6 mag, transparent,
early-type galaxy at a redshift of about z_l = 0.85; it has a major axis
effective radius R_e=0.68+/-0.05 arcsec, projected axis ratio b/a=0.77+/-0.02,
and major axis PA=60+/-2 degrees. The lens is the brightest member of a group
of seven galaxies with similar R-I and I-H colors, and the two closest group
members produce sufficient tidal perturbations to explain the ring morphology.
The host galaxy of the MG1131+0456 source is a z_s > 2 ERO (``extremely red
object'') which is lensed into optical and infrared rings of dramatically
different morphologies. These differences imply a strongly wavelength-dependent
source morphology that could be explained by embedding the host in a larger,
dusty disk. At 1.6 micron (H), the ring is spectacularly luminous, with a total
observed flux of H=17.4 mag and a de-magnified flux of 19.3 mag, corresponding
to a 1-2L_* galaxy at the probable source redshift of z_s > 2. Thus, it is
primarily the stellar emission of the radio source host galaxy that produces
the overall colors of two of the reddest radio lenses, MG1131+0456 and
B~1938+666, aided by the suppression of optical AGN emission by dust in the
source galaxy. The dusty lens hypothesis -- that many massive early-type
galaxies with 0.2 < z_l < 1.0 have large, uniform dust opacities -- is ruled
out.

are most likely gas stripped from a galaxy group centered on NGC 4874 falling

observed weakness of X-ray reflection from the disk is due to bulk motion of
the emitting hot plasma away from the reflector. A mildly relativistic motion
causes aberration reducing X-ray emission towards the disk. This in turn
reduces the reprocessed radiation from the disk and leads to a hard spectrum of
the X-ray source. The resulting spectral index is Gamma=1.9B^{1/2} where
B=gamma(1+beta) is the aberration factor for a bulk velocity beta=v/c. The
observed Gamma=1.6 and the amount of reflection, R=0.3, in Cyg X-1 in the hard
state can both be explained assuming a bulk velocity beta=0.3. We discuss one
possible scenario: the compact magnetic flares are dominated by e+- pairs which
are ejected away from the reflector by the pressure of the reflected radiation.
We also discuss physical constraints on the disk-corona model and argue that
the magnetic flares are related to magneto-rotational instabilities in the
accretion disk.

on the power required to carve out the radio synchrotron remnant within the

energy (~10^51 ergs) released in a typical supernova (SN) explosion. Yet it
shares several characteristics in common with SN remnants (SNRs), the most
significant of which is the ~0.1-10 GeV gamma-ray spectrum measured by EGRET,
if we associate the Galactic center source 2EGJ1746-2852 with this nonthermal

like that of SNRs, can be fitted with the gamma-rays produced in neutral pion
decays. Further, we demonstrate in a self-consistent manner that the leptons
released in the associated charged pion decays produce an e+e- distribution
that can mimic a power-law with index ~3, like that inferred from the VLA data
for this source. These relativistic electrons and positrons also radiate by
bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering with the intense IR and UV
fields from the nucleus. We show that the overall emissivity calculated in this
way may account for Sgr A East's broadband spectrum ranging from GHz
frequencies all the way to TeV energies, where Whipple has thus far set an
upper limit to the flux corresponding to a 2.5-sigma signal above the noise.

the wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main
general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along
with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of
extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral
region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the
wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between
extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships
provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction.
Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the
uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the
wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR
through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction
law varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true
monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable
for dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be
used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.

  Microlensing Events","Revised to take account of important work by Hardy & Walker (1995)",,"10.1086/307114",,"astro-ph",,"  A major problem in the interpretation of microlensing events is that the only
measured quantity, the Einstein time scale t_E, is a degenerate combination of
the three quantities one would like to know, the mass, distance, and speed of
the lens. This degeneracy can be partly broken by measuring either a ""parallax""
or a ""proper motion"" and completely broken by measuring both. Proper motions
can easily be measured for caustic-crossing binary-lens events. Here we examine
the possibility (first discussed by Hardy & Walker) that one could also measure
a parallax for some of these events by comparing the light curves of the
caustic crossing as seen from two observatories on Earth. We derive analytic
expressions for the signal-to-noise ratio of the parallax measurement in terms
of the characteristics of the source and the geometry of the event. For
Galactic halo binary lenses seen toward the LMC, the light curve is delayed
from one continent to another by a seemingly minuscule 15 seconds (compared to
t_E ~ 40 days). However, this is sufficient to cause a difference in
magnification of order 10%. To actually extract complete parallax information
(as opposed to merely detecting the effect) requires observations from three
non-collinear observatories. Parallaxes cannot be measured for binary lenses in
the LMC but they can be measured for Galactic halo binary lenses seen toward
M31. Robust measurements are possible for disk binary lenses seen toward the
Galactic bulge, but are difficult for bulge binary lenses.

multiple galaxies (non-interacting), distorted galaxies, tailed galaxies, line
galaxies, dwarf galaxy groups and galaxy aggregates. The various morphologies
are described, and a catalog is presented of 248 objects in these five clusters
along with color, and positional information obtained from CCD images taken
with the WIYN 3.5m telescope in broadband B and R filters.
  Distorted, interacting, and fine-scale substructures have a range of colors
extending from blue objects with B-R $\approx$ 0, to redder colors at B-R
$\approx$ 2.5. We also find that the structures with the most disturbed
morphology have the bluest colors. Additionally, the relative number
distributions of these structures suggests that two separate classes of galaxy
clusters exist: one dominated by distorted structures and the other dominated
by galaxy associations. The Coma and Perseus clusters, respectively, are
proposed as models for these types of clusters.
  Possible mechanisms for the production of fine-scale substructure are
reviewed and compared to observations of z $\approx$ 0.4 Butcher-Oemler
clusters. We conclude, based on color, positional, and statistical data, that
the most likely mechanism for the creation of these structures is through an
interaction with the gravitational potential of the cluster, possibly coupled
with effects of high speed interactions with large cluster ellipticals.

less substructures can be reasonably described by the NFW profile, and the rest
with the least substructures can be fitted by the NFW profile very nicely. For
the halos which can be reasonably or better fitted by the NFW profile, the

well described by a lognormal function with a dispersion $\sigma=0.27$. The
mean value of $c$ is quite close to that predicted by NFW, though it decreases

significantly stronger clustering for low mass halos than Mo & White predict. A

The S_N values for dE galaxies are thus on average significantly higher than
those for late-type galaxies, which have S_N < 1. This suggests that dE
galaxies are more akin to giant Es than to late-type galaxies. If there are
dormant or stripped irregulars hiding among the dE population, they are likely
to be among the non-nucleated dEs. Furthermore, the similarities in the
properties of the globular clusters and in the spatial distributions of dE,Ns

formed in dwarf-sized fragments that merged into larger galaxies.

2\pi/k ~ 450-2350 km/s (2-12 comoving \hmpc for \Omega=1). We examine a number
of possible sources of systematic error and find none that are significant on
these scales. In particular, we show that spatial variations in the UV
background caused by the discreteness of the source population should have
negligible effect on our P(k) measurement. We obtain consistent results from
the high and low redshift halves of the data set and from an entirely
independent sample of nine QSO spectra with mean redshift z=2.1. A power law
fit to our measured P(k) yields a logarithmic slope n=-2.25 +/- 0.18 and an
amplitude \Delta^2(k_p) = 0.57^{+0.26}_{-0.18}, where $\Delta^2$ is the
contribution to the density variance from a unit interval of lnk and k_p=0.008
(km/s)^{-1}. Direct comparison of our mass P(k) to the measured clustering of
Lyman Break Galaxies shows that they are a highly biased population, with a
bias factor b~2-5. The slope of the linear P(k), never previously measured on
these scales, is close to that predicted by models based on inflation and Cold
Dark Matter (CDM). The P(k) amplitude is consistent with some scale-invariant,
COBE-normalized CDM models (e.g., an open model with \Omega_0=0.4) and
inconsistent with others (e.g., \Omega=1). Even with limited dynamic range and
substantial statistical uncertainty, a measurement of P(k) that has no unknown
``bias factors'' offers many opportunities for testing theories of structure
formation and constraining cosmological parameters. (Shortened)

sky sensitive to any visual magnitude brighter than 15 each night. Such a
record could be created with a modest array of small telescopes, which
collectively generate no more than a few Gigabytes of data daily.
Alternatively, a few small telescopes could continually re-point to scan and
reco rd the entire sky down to any visual magnitude brighter than 15 with a
recurrence epoch of at most a few weeks, again always generating less than one
Gigabyte of data each night. These estimates derive from CCD ability and
budgets typical of university research projects. As a prototype, we have
developed and are utilizing an inexpensive single-telescope system that obtains
optical data from about 1500 square degrees. We discuss the general case of
creating and storing data from a both an epochal survey, where a small number
of telescopes continually scan the sky, and a continuous survey, composed of a
constellation of telescopes dedicated each continually inspect a designated
section of the sky. We compute specific limitations of canonical surveys in
visible light, and estimate that all-sky continuous visual light surveys could
be sensitive to magnitude 20 in a single night by about 2010. Possible
scientific returns of continuous and epochal sky surveys include continued
monitoring of most known variable stars, establishing case histories for
variables of future interest, uncovering new forms of stellar variability,
discovering the brightest cases of microlensing, discovering new novae and

metal-poor stars from the analysis of high resolution and high signal-to-noise

have been searched for, with a special emphasis on the neutron capture
elements. This analysis shows that the r elements are closely correlated to the
alpha elements, which is in agreement with the generally accepted idea that the
r-process takes place during the explosion of massive stars. The situation is
more complex as far as the s elements are concerned. Their relation with the
alpha elements is not linear. In a first group of stars, the relative abundance
of the s elements increases only slightly with the alpha elements overabundance
until the latter reaches a maximum value. For the second group, the s elements
show a rather large range of enhancement and a constant (and maximum) value of
the alpha elements overabundance. This peculiar behaviour leads us to
distinguish between two sub-populations of metal-poor stars, namely PopIIa
(first group) and PopIIb (second group). We suggest a scenario of formation of
metal-poor stars based on two distinct phases of chemical enrichment, a first
phase essentially consisting in supernova explosions of massive stars, and a
second phase where the enrichment is provided by stellar winds from
intermediate mass stars. More specifically, we assume that all thick disk and
field halo stars were born in globular clusters, from which they escaped,
either during an early disruption of the cluster (PopIIa) or, later, through an
evaporation process (PopIIb).

in an LxLxD geometry. The interface is forced to run parallel to the LxL planes
by imposing periodic boundary conditions in these directions and fixed boundary
conditions in the D direction, with one side favoring A and the other side

averaging in each column over profiles relative to the local interface

structure amounts to maximizing a conditional probability. A straightforward
approach to accomplish this is a nested Monte Carlo where the conformation
space is explored over and over again for different fixed sequences, which
requires excessive computational demand. Several approximate attempts to remedy
this situation, based on energy minimization for fixed structure or high-$T$
expansions, have been proposed. These methods are fast but often not accurate
since folding occurs at low $T$.
  Results: We develop a multisequence Monte Carlo procedure, where both
sequence and conformation space are simultaneously probed with efficient
prescriptions for pruning sequence space. The method is explored on
hydrophobic/polar models. We first discuss short lattice chains, in order to
compare with exact data and with other methods. The method is then successfully
applied to lattice chains with up to 50 monomers, and to off-lattice 20-mers.
  Conclusions: The multisequence Monte Carlo method offers a new approach to
sequence design in coarse-grained models. It is much more efficient than
previous Monte Carlo methods, and is, as it stands, applicable to a fairly wide
range of two-letter models.

coputationally expensive to fetch. Our approach uses ""information filters"" to
considerably narrow the universe of possiblities before retrieval. We are
especially interested in redundant information filters that save time over more
general but more costly filters. Efficient retrieval requires that decision
must be made about the necessity, order, and concurrent processing of proposed
filters (an ""execution plan""). We develop simple polynomial-time local criteria
for optimal execution plans, and show that most forms of concurrency are
suboptimal with information filters. Although the general problem of finding an
optimal execution plan is likely exponential in the number of filters, we show
experimentally that our local optimality criteria, used in a polynomial-time
algorithm, nearly always find the global optimum with 15 filters or less, a
sufficient number of filters for most applications. Our methods do not require
special hardware and avoid the high processor idleness that is characteristic
of massive parallelism solutions to this problem. We apply our ideas to an
important application, information retrieval of cpationed data using
natural-language understanding, a problem for which the natural-language
processing can be the bottleneck if not implemented well.

Type I strings and Ho\v rava-Witten supergravity models. The latter allows
possibilities for an eleven-dimensional scale at TeV energies with one large

cross the Earth core. The resonance is operative at small mixing angles but
differs from the MSW one. It is in many respects similar to the electron
paramagnetic resonance taking place in a specific configuration of two magnetic
fields. The conditions for existence of the new resonance include, in
particular, specific constraints on the neutrino oscillation lengths in the
Earth mantle and in the Earth core, thus the resonance is a ``neutrino
oscillation length resonance''. It leads also to enhancement of the $\nu_2 \to

sections for large recoil momenta, $p_m > 300$ MeV/c, are substantially

is insensitive to channel coupling, even for fairly low ejectile energies, but
polarization transfer for neutron knockout retains nonnegligible sensitivity to
channel coupling for energies up to about 200 MeV. The present results suggest
