sources at sub-mm wavelengths. We extend our previous calculation on the
expected number of lensed optical arcs and radio sources to study the sub-mm
lensed source statistics due to foreground massive clusters. For a flat
cosmology with Omega_m=0.4 and Omega_Lambda =0.6, we predict roughly 1.5 \times
10^4 lensed sub-mm sources with flux densities greater than 4 mJy at 850
microns, and with amplifications due to lensing greater than 2, towards galaxy
clusters with X-ray luminosities greater than 8 x 10^44 h^-2 ergs s^-1 (0.3 to
3.5 keV band). We compare our predictions with observations from the SCUBA
instrument, and briefly consider the possibility of using the South Pole 10-m
sub-mm telescope and the Planck surveyor to identify lensed sub-mm sources. A
catalog of around 100 gravitationally lensed sources at 353 GHz may be a useful
by-product of Planck.

is well-suited for comparison with white dwarf companions of millisecond
pulsars. The tracks are based on a 1 Msol model sequence extending from the
pre-main sequence stage up to the tip of the red-giant branch. Applying large
mass loss rates at appropriate positions forced the models to move off the
giant branch. The further evolution was then followed across the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and down the cooling branch. At maximum effective
temperature the envelope masses above the helium cores increase from 0.6 to 5.4
x 10^{-3} Msol for decreasing mass. We carefully checked for the occurrence of
thermal instabilities of the hydrogen shell by adjusting the computational time
steps accordingly. Hydrogen flashes have been found to take place only in the
mass interval 0.21 < M/Msol < 0.3. The models show that hydrogen shell burning
contributes significantly to the luminosity budget of white dwarfs with helium
cores. For very low masses the hydrogen shell luminosity remains to be dominant
even down to effective temperatures well below 10000K. Accordingly, the
corresponding cooling ages are significantly larger than those gained from
model calculations which neglect nuclear burning or the white dwarf progenitor
evolution. Using the atmospheric parameters of the white dwarf in the PSR

of distinct spectra electrons within the lobes and spectral gradients coming
from the dynamical histories of a given flow element rather than from

efficient site for particle acceleration in a young SNR. 2) At these early

primary shocks should be close to 0.5 unless those shocks are modified by
cosmic-ray pressures. However, interaction with the cloud generates regions of
distinctly steeper spectra, which may complicate interpretation in terms of
global dynamical models for SNR evolution. 3) The internal motions within the
SNR become highly turbulent following the cloud interaction. 4) An initially
uniform interstellar magnetic field is preferentially amplified along the
magnetic equator of the SNR, primarily due to biased amplification by
instabilities. Independent of the external field configuration, there is a net
radial direction to this field inside the SNR. 5) Filamentary radio structures
correlate well with magnetic filaments, while diffuse emission follows the

hard X-ray is an absorbed direct continuum from a hidden Seyfert 1 nucleus; the
soft X-ray is dominated by the scattered central continuum from an extended

extraordinarily luminous (>10^{42} erg/s) partly extended (> 30 kpc diameter)
X-ray emission from the double-nucleus ultraluminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240.
The ROSAT spectrum can be well fit by emission from two components in roughly
equal proportions: a thermal optically thin plasma with kT \sim 0.6 keV and a
hard component that can be represented by a canonical AGN powerlaw. Source
counts appear to have dropped by 30% within a year. Altogether, these findings
can be well explained by a contribution of radiation from an AGN essentially
hidden at other wavelengths. Fits of ASCA spectra, conducted by various groups,
corroborate this result, revealing a high-equivalent width FeK blend which
again is straightforwardly interpreted by scattered AGN light.
  If radiating at the Eddington limit, the central black hole mass does not
exceed 10^7 M_sun. We discuss implications for the formation of this AGN.
However, the luminosity in the remaining extended thermal component is still at
the limits of a pure starburst-wind-induced source. We suggest that the deeply
buried starburst has switched to a partially dormant phase so that heating of
the outflow is diminished and a cooling flow could have been established. This
flow may account for the extended shock heating traced by LINER-like emission
line ratios and the extremely luminous H_2 emission from the central region of
this galaxy. Next-generation X-ray telescopes will be able to test this
proposal.

We detect a total of 17 fine structure emission lines emitted by a wide range

and the Br beta HI line.
  We find that the mid-IR fine structure line profiles display blue asymmetries
which are very similar to those observed in the optical lines produced in the
narrow line region. Because the mid-infrared lines are much less sensitive to
extinction than are the optical lines this similarity places strong constraints
on scenarios which have been invoked to explain the optical line asymmetries.
For example, we are able to rule out the simplest radial-motion-plus-dust
scenarios for the production of the line asymmetries. Our preferred model is
that of a central, geometrically thin but optically thick, obscuring screen of
sub-arcsecond extension, enclosing a total hydrogen gas mass of >~5E6 Msun.
This mass may be molecular.
  The weakness of `PAH' emission features in the low resolution spectrum is
evidence that star formation plays a minor role in the circumnuclear region of
NGC 4151. In a companion paper (Alexander et al., accepted by ApJ), we use the

irregular galaxy UGC 685 are presented. The brightest part of the stellar
population is resolved in B and R, very few also in J. The stellar
color-magnitude diagram is discussed. An estimate of the distance to UGC 685 of
5.5 Mpc is derived based on the brightest blue supergiant stars. Most of the
resolved bright stars show colors in the range $-0.1 \le B-R \le +0.7$. The
continuum light of the unresolved stars is distributed rather regular in B, R,
and J, showing only minor irregularities. This surface brightness distribution
follows an exponential law in all three colors with a scale length $r_c = 0.33$
kpc. The central surface brightnesses are $21.57 \pm 0.09 mag/\Box''$, $20.65
\pm 0.06mag/\Box''$, and $20.11 \pm 0.11 mag/\Box''$, in B, R, and J,
respectively. The surface brightness can be traced out to 5 $r_c$ in B and R.
Thus, UGC 685 belongs to the class of dwarfs where the HI distribution is much
more extended (here 2.6 times) than the optical (stellar) light distribution,
but contrary to many objects of this type, it does not belong to the class of
low-surface brightness objects. The overall colors are $B-R = + 0.97$, $B-J =
+1.55$ and the magnitude is B = 14.55 ($M_B^o$ = -14.5). The classification as
an irregular dwarf results from the few HII regions of UGC 685. On an
H${\alpha}$ Calar Alto 2.2m telescope CCD image, I identified only 5 HII
regions. The total H${\alpha}$ flux corresponds to a mildly on-going star
formation with a rate of 0.003 \Msolar yr$^{-1}$, a low rate even in comparison
to other dwarfs. The available data do not indicate any major deviation from
this rather low star formation rate within the last $10^9$ yr.

the 12CO(1->0) map of Shen & Lo (1995), namely two lobes and a compact central
source, though with different relative intensities. The lobes are more
conspicuous and the central source is fainter in 13CO than in 12CO.
  The velocity field observed around the nucleus shows a very steep gradient
(140 km/s over 75 pc), which is very probably caused by the stellar bar visible
in the near infrared. The dynamical centre coincides with the IR peak and is
shifted 6"" north-east of the compact 13CO source. The two CO lobes appear to be
associated with the ends of the bar and not with a molecular ring, as usually
assumed. They are probably shaped by the strong UV radiation from the central
region. 13CO must be more photodissociated than the self-shielded 12CO
molecules in the central ~250 pc region, which may explain the relative
weakness of the 13CO central source.
  A 130 pc-wide bubble of molecular gas has been identified, which happens to
host the most luminous compact radio source in M82. It lies 120 pc west of the
IR peak between the central source and the western lobe and seems characterized
by warmer gas, strong UV radio free-free radiation, and an enhanced cosmic ray

However, the provided example is unstable, although it has a more realistic
equation of state in the sense that the sound velocity is finite. On the other

allow stable configurations with trapped modes therefore remains an open

function description can be be understood as the ensemble average over
stochastic equations of Langevin type. For this we couple a free scalar boson
quantum field to an environmental heat bath with some given temperature T. The
inherent presence of noise and dissipation related by the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem guarantees that the modes or particles become
thermally populated on average in the long-time limit. This interpretation
leads to a more intuitive physical picture of the process of thermalization and
of the interpretation of the Kadanoff-Baym equations. One also immediately
understands that the emerging wave equations for long wavelength modes with
momenta much smaller than temperature behave nearly as classical fields. We
also demonstrate how the problem of so called pinch singularities is resolved
by a clear physical necessity of damping within the one-particle propagator.
The occurrence of such ill-defined terms arising solely in a strictly
perturbative expansion in out of equilibrium quantum field theory has a natural
interpretation in analogy to Fermi's golden rule.

electroweak data from LEP I and the low-energy neutral-current experimental

geometry, the Gamma-trace of Atiyah being replaced by a semicontinuous
semifinite trace on the C*-algebra of almost local operators. It is proved that
they are invariant under quasi-isometries and, making use of the theory of
singular traces for C*-algebras developed in math/9802015, they are interpreted
as asymptotic dimensions since, in analogy with what happens in Connes'
noncommutative geometry, they indicate which power of the Laplacian gives rise
to a singular trace. Therefore, as in geometric measure theory, these numbers
furnish the order of infinitesimal giving rise to a non trivial measure. The
dimensional interpretation is strenghtened in the case of the 0-th
Novikov-Shubin invariant, which is shown to coincide, under suitable geometric
conditions, with the asymptotic counterpart of the box dimension of a metric
space. Since this asymptotic dimension coincides with the polynomial growth of
a discrete group, the previous equality generalises a result by Varopoulos for
covering manifolds. This paper subsumes dg-ga/9612015. In particular, in the
previous version only the 0th Novikov-Shubin number was considered, while here
Novikov-Shubin numbers for all p are defined and studied.

However, in some particular orbits, large instabilities may occur. This
possibility also greatly diminishes with the introduction of friction. But, if
the friction is large, the system may be overdamped and then, there is a
possibility of large DCC domain formation in some events.

number and angular momentum constrained generator coordinate(GCM) calculation
based on self-consistent three-dimensional cranking solutions. From the
analysis of the wave function of the lowest GCM solution, we confirm that this
nucleus shows a tilted rotational motion in its yrast states, at least with the
present set of force parameters of the pairing-plus-quadrupole interaction
Hamiltonian. A close examination of behavior of other GCM solutions reveals a
sign of a possible occurrence of multi-band crossing in the nucleus.
Furthermore, in the course of calculations, we have also found a new potential
curve along the prime meridian on the globe of the $J=18\hbar$ sphere. Along
this new solution the characters of proton and neutron gap parameters get
interchanged. Namely, $\Delta_p$ almost vanishes while $\Delta_n$ grows to a
finite value close to the one corresponding to the principal axis
rotation(PAR). A state in the new solution curve at the PAR point turns out to
have almost the same characteristic features of an yrare $s$-band state which
gets located just above the $g$-band in our calculation. This fact suggests a
new type of seesaw vibrational mode of the proton and the neutron pairing,
occurring through a wobbling motion. The mode is considered to bridge the
$g$-band states and the $s$-band states in the backbending region.

progressive motion of a soliton in a Toda lattice with friction, while an
unstaggered drivng force cannot. A physical context of the model is that of a
chain of anharmonically coupled particles adsorbed on a solid surface of a
finite size. The ac driving force models a standing acoustic wave excited on
the surface. Simulations demonstrate that the state left behind the moving
soliton, with the particles shifted from their equilibrium positions, gradually
relaxes back to the equilibrium state that existed before the passage of the
soliton. Perturbation theory predicts that the ac-driven soliton exists if the
amplitude of the drive exceeds a certain threshold. The analytical prediction
for the threshold is in reasonable agreement with that found numerically.
Collisions between two counter propagating solitons were also simulated,
demonstrating that the collisions are, essentially fully elastic.
