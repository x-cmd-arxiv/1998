entire EXOSAT dataset, four observations covering a total of 230,000 seconds of
1-20 keV spectral and timing data. In one of the observations, 4U 1705-44 was
in a low intensity ""island"" state and had an unusually hard spectrum. The fast
timing analysis of this hard island state shows a power spectrum very similar
to that of black hole candidates in the ""low state"", with a flat-topped
band-limited noise component that gradually steepens towards higher frequency.
We perform for the first time a quantitative comparison of the timing behaviour
of an atoll source in the hard island state (4U 1705-44) with that of a black
hole candidate in the low state (Cygnus X-1). We also compare the power
spectrum of 4U 1705-44 in the hard island state with those of the atoll source
4U 1608-52 in a similar state as reported by Yoshida et al. (1993). Our results
confirm that there are similarities between the fast timing behaviour of the
hard island states of these atoll sources and the low state of black hole
candidates, yet we also find significant differences in power spectral
parameters; the power spectra of the neutron star systems have a lower rms
amplitude and are less steep. We find a trend among the neutron star power
spectral properties, in the sense that the lower the centroid frequency of the
fitted Lorentzian is, the higher its fractional rms amplitude, and the steeper
the continuum underneath it. We propose a new method to fit the power spectra
of Cyg X-1 and other black hole candidates in the low state, that provides a
significantly better fit than previous models.

Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 observations in the F555W (~V) and F814W (~I)
filters. These data reveal the morphology of the HB and allow us to estimate
the cluster metallicity using the shape and color of the red giant branch. The
principal result we report herein is that 8 of the 10 clusters possess
exclusively red HB morphologies yet their metallicities are as metal-poor as
[Fe/H] ~ -1.6. Indeed, these 8 clusters present basically only giant branch
clumps reminiscent of intermediate age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds.
In addition, two of the clusters form a second parameter pair which have
similar metallicities but very disparate HB types. Under the assumption that
cluster age is the global second parameter, the average age of halo globular
clusters in M33 appears to be a few Gyr younger than halo clusters in the Milky
Way. Using the observed properties of HB stars in M31 and M33 along with
published main-sequence turnoff ages for the globular clusters in the Milky
Way, LMC, SMC, and the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr), we attempt to sketch
the early formation history of these galaxies. This indicates that the Milky
Way, M31, M33, the LMC, and Sgr all experienced their first epoch of cluster
formation soon after the Big Bang. Three to four Gyr later, the SMC began to
form its first generation of clusters; the bulk of the M33 clusters formed
later still. We note that the halo clusters in M33 formed over a much longer
time period than those in the Milky Way and M31.

metallicity halo stars, it has been argued that a ``primary'' component in the
nucleosynthesis of Be must be present in addition to the ``secondary''
component from standard Galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis. In this paper we
critically re-evaluate the evidence for the primary versus secondary character
of Li, Be, and B evolution, analyzing both in the observations and in Galactic
chemical evolution models. While it appears that [Be/H] versus [Fe/H] has a
logarithmic slope near 1, it is rather the Be-O trend that directly arises from
the physics of spallation production. Using new abundances for oxygen in halo
stars based on UV OH lines, we find that the Be-O slope has a large uncertainty
due to systematic effects, rendering it difficult to distinguish from the data
between the secondary slope of 2 and the primary slope of 1. The possible
difference between the Be-Fe and Be-O slopes is a consequence of the variation
in O/Fe versus Fe: recent data suggests a negative slope rather than zero
(i.e., Fe $\propto$ O) as is often assumed. In addition to a phenomenological
analysis of Be and B evolution, we have also examined the predicted LiBeB, O,
and Fe trends in Galactic chemical evolution models which include outflow.
Based on our results, it is possible that a good fit to the LiBeB evolution
requires only traditional the Galactic cosmic ray spallation, and the (primary)
neutrino-process contribution to B11. We thus suggest that these two processes
might be sufficient to explain Li6, Be, and B evolution in the Galaxy, without
the need for an additional primary source of Be and B.

which allow for both a good resolution near the central black hole and a large
computational volume. They include the use of a physical equation of state as
well as the neutrino emission from the hot matter of the torus. The gravity of
the black hole is described with a Newtonian and alternatively with a
Paczynski-Wiita potential. In a post-processing step, we evaluate our models
for the energy deposition by nu-nubar annihilation around the accretion torus.
Our models show that nu-nubar annihilation can yield the energy to account for
weak, short gamma-ray bursts, if moderate beaming is involved. In fact, the
barrier of the dense baryonic gas of the torus suggests that the low-density
pair-photon-plasma is beamed as axial jets into a fraction 2 delta Omega/ (4
pi) between 1/100 and 1/10 of the sky, corresponding to opening half-angles of
roughly ten to several tens of degrees. Thus gamma-burst energies of
10^{50}--10^{51} erg seem within the reach of our models (if the source is
interpreted as radiating isotropically), corresponding to luminosities around
10^{51} erg/s for typical burst durations of 0.1--1 s. Gravitational capture of
radiation by the black hole, redshift and ray bending do not reduce the jet
energy significantly. Effects associated with the Kerr character of the rapidly

two star clusters. However, the limited dynamic range makes these estimates
simply descriptors of the large-scale clustering, and not admissible evidence

useful for comparison with molecular-line and dust-continuum maps of

Analyzing such maps can be used to discriminate between fractal structure and

show clear absorption-line signatures of massive stars, indicating a stellar
origin for the UV continuum. Similar features are probably present in NGC 6500.
The same stellar signatures may be present but undetectable in NGC 4594, due to
the low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, and in M81 and NGC 4579, due to
superposed strong, broad emission lines. The compact central UV continuum
source that is observed in these galaxies is a nuclear star cluster rather than
a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), at least in some cases. At
least four of the LINERs suffer from an ionizing photon deficit, in the sense
that the ionizing photon flux inferred from the observed far-UV continuum is
insufficient to drive the optical H I recombination lines. Examination of the
nuclear X-ray flux of each galaxy shows a high X-ray/UV ratio in the four
``UV-photon starved'' LINERs. In these four objects, a separate component,
emitting predominantly in the extreme-UV, is the likely ionizing agent, and is
perhaps unrelated to the observed nuclear UV emission. Future observations can
determine whether the UV continuum in LINERs is always dominated by a starburst
or, alternatively, that there are two types of UV-bright LINERs:
starburst-dominated and AGN-dominated. Interestingly, recent results show that
starbursts dominate the nuclear energetics in many Seyfert 2s as well.

size of about 0.5 * RTT to 1 * RTT is sufficient to provide over 98% throughput
to infinite TCP traffic for long latency networks and a large number of

features in supergravity mediated supersymmetry breaking. The result is an
upper bound on gaugino masses within reach of the LHC and a 1.5 TeV lepton
collider. Thus, cosmological considerations are beginning to limit the
supersymmetric mass spectra in the experimentally verifiable range without
recourse to finetuning arguments, and without assuming a zero cosmological
constant.

(hereafter `SDLCQ') has emerged as a very powerful tool for solving
supersymmetric field theories. In this scheme, one calculates the light-cone
supercharge with respect to a discretized light-cone Fock basis, instead of
working with the light-cone Hamiltonian. This procedure has the advantage of
preserving supersymmetry even in the discretized theory, and eliminates the
need for explicit renormalizations in 1+1 dimensions. In order to compare the
usual DLCQ prescription with the supersymmetric prescription, we consider two
dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory coupled to a massive adjoint Majorana
fermion, which is known to be supersymmetric at a particular value of the
fermion mass. After studying how singular-valued amplitudes and intermediate
zero momentum modes are regularized in both schemes, we are able to establish a
precise connection between conventional DLCQ and its supersymmetric extension,
SDLCQ. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the (irrelevant)
interaction that renders the DLCQ formulation of the theory exactly
supersymmetric for any light-cone compactification. We check our analytical
results via a numerical procedure, and discuss the relevance of this
interaction when supersymmetry is explicitly broken.

delay lines and electronically switched linear elements, photo-detectors, and
auxiliary bosons. As a result we show that with these tools a never failing
Bell measurement is impossible.

an arbitrary quantum system S, where $\cal G$ is a finite group acting on the
space state of S. Several applications of this idea are discussed. In
particular when S is a N-qubit quantum computer interacting with its
environment and $\cal G$ the symmetric group of qubit permutations, the
resulting effective dynamics admits noiseless subspaces. Moreover it is shown
that the recently introduced iterated-pulses schemes for reducing decoherence
in quantum computers fit in this general framework. The noise-inducing
component of the Hamiltonian is filtered out by the symmetrization procedure
just due to its transformation properties.

non-tomographic approaches which are based on measurements performed with a
Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Two consequences of successfully implemented state
reconstruction are pointed out. First, it allows one to determine
experimentally the expectation value of an arbitrary operator without a device
measuring it. Second, state reconstruction suggests a reformulation of
Schroedinger's equation in terms of expectation values only, without explicit
reference to a wave function or a density operator.

entirely on the wave function description of the squeezed states. Quantum field
theoretic approach is used to describe the squeezing of the electromagnetic
field in its most complete form that takes into account temporal and spatial
characteristics of the squeezed state. An analog of the Wigner function for the
full electromagnetic field is introduced and expressed in terms of second order
correlation functions. The field-theoretic approach enables one to study the
propagation of the ``squeezing wave'' in space-time. A simple example of weak
squeezing, that allows for all calculations to be done analytically, is
discussed in detail.

  Contrary to standard procedures, the environmental recoil effects associated
with locally induced heat flows are not completely disregarded. The main
technical tool in the study of such weakly-out-of equilibrium systems is a
consequent exploitation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The third Newton law
in the mean is utilised to generate diffusion-type processes which are either
anomalous (enhanced), or generically non-dispersive.
