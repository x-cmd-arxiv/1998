linear plants, but only for plants meeting very restrictive assumptions.
Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) has the potential, in principle, to
ensure stability without such tight restrictions. It also offers nonlinear and
neural extensions for optimal control, with empirically supported links to what
is seen in the brain. However, the relevant ADP methods in use today -- TD,
HDP, DHP, GDHP -- and the Galerkin-based versions of these all have serious
limitations when used here as parallel distributed real-time learning systems;
either they do not possess quadratic unconditional stability (to be defined) or
they lead to incorrect results in the stochastic case. (ADAC or Q-learning
designs do not help.) After explaining these conclusions, this paper describes
new ADP designs which overcome these limitations. It also addresses the
Generalized Moving Target problem, a common family of static optimization
problems, and describes a way to stabilize large-scale economic equilibrium
models, such as the old long-term energy model of DOE.

modified epicycles compel fluid elements to follow magnetic lines of force.
Field line (and streamline) configurations may be elliptical or hyperbolic,
prograde or retrograde. These structures have previously known hydrodynamical
analogs: the ``planet'' solutions described by Goodman, Narayan, & Goldreich.
  The primary focus of this investigation is configurations in the disk plane.
A related family of solutions lying in a vertical plane is briefly discussed;
other families of solutions may exist. Whether these MHD structures are stable
is not yet known, but could readily be determined by three-dimensional
simulations. If stable or quasi-stable, these simple structures may find
important applications in both accretion and galactic disks.

with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer provides the first direct probe of the
interaction of an accretion disk with the magnetic field of a weakly magnetic
(B<10^10 G) neutron star. We demonstrate that the presence of coherent
pulsations from a weakly magnetic neutron star over a wide range of accretion
rates places strong constraints on models of the disk-magnetosphere
interaction. We argue that the simple Mdot^(3/7) scaling law for the Keplerian
frequency at the magnetic interaction radius, widely used to model disk
accretion onto magnetic stars, is not consistent with observations of SAX
J1808.4-3658 for most proposed equations of state for stable neutron stars. We
show that the usually neglected effects of multipole magnetic moments,
radiation drag forces, and general relativity must be considered when modeling
such weakly magnetic systems. Using only very general assumptions, we obtain a
robust estimate of mu~(1-10)x10^26 G cm^3 for the dipole magnetic moment of SAX
J1808.4-3658, implying a surface dipole field of ~10^8-10^9 G at the stellar
equator. We therefore infer that after the end of its accretion phase, this
source will become a normal millisecond radio pulsar. Finally, we compare the
physical properties of this pulsar to those of the non-pulsing, weakly magnetic
neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and argue that the absence of coherent
pulsations from the latter does not necessarily imply that these neutron stars
have significantly different magnetic field strengths from SAX J1808.4-3658.

galaxies may contain a fair sample of the baryonic mass fraction of the
universe. Since the gas mass fraction from the hot ICM is believed to be
constant in time, the value of the cosmological deceleration parameter $q_0$
can be determined by comparing the calculated gas mass fraction in nearby and
distant clusters (Pen 1997). To test the potential of this method, we compare
the gas fractions derived for a sample of luminous ($L_X > 10^{45} $erg
s$^{-1}$), nearby clusters with those calculated for eight luminous, distant
($0.3 < z < 0.6$) clusters using ASCA and ROSAT observations. For consistency,
we evaluate the gas mass fraction at a fixed physical radius of 1 $h_{50}^{-1}$
Mpc (assuming $q_0=0.0$). We find a best fit value of $q_0 = 0.07$ with -0.47 <
q_0 < 0.67 at 95% confidence. We also determine the gas fraction using the
method of Evrard, Metzler, & Navarro (1997) to find the total mass within
$r_{500}$, the radius where the mean overdensity of matter is 500 times the
critical density. In simulations, this method reduces the scatter in the
determination of gravitational mass without biasing the mean. We find that it
also reduces the scatter in actual observations for nearby clusters, but not as
much as simulations suggest. Using this method, the best fit value is $q_0 =
0.04$ with -0.50 < q_0 < 0.64. The excellent agreement between these two
methods suggests that this may be a useful technique for determining $q_0$. The
constraints on $q_0$ should improve as more distant clusters are studied and
precise temperature profiles are measured to large radii.

These we call ""weakly quantum ergodic.'' Indeed for a class of ""slow ergodic""
classical systems, it is found that each eigenstate becomes localized to an
ever decreasing fraction of the available state space, in the semiclassical
limit. Nevertheless, each eigenstate in this limit covers phase space evenly on
any classical scale, and long-time transport properties betwen individual
quantum states remain ergodic due to the diffractive effects which dominate
quantum phase space exploration.

and Lorentz symmetry through measurements of anomalous magnetic moments and
charge-to-mass ratios. Possible CPT and Lorentz violations arising from
spontaneous symmetry breaking at a fundamental level are treated in the context
of a general extension of the SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) standard model and its
restriction to quantum electrodynamics. We describe signals that might appear
in principle, introduce suitable figures of merit, and estimate CPT and Lorentz
bounds attainable in present and future Penning-trap experiments. Experiments
measuring anomaly frequencies are found to provide the sharpest tests of CPT
symmetry. Bounds are attainable of approximately $10^{-20}$ in the
electron-positron case and of $10^{-23}$ for a suggested experiment with
protons and antiprotons. Searches for diurnal frequency variations in these
experiments could also limit certain types of Lorentz violation to the level of
$10^{-18}$ in the electron-positron system and others at the level of
$10^{-21}$ in the proton-antiproton system. In contrast, measurements comparing
cyclotron frequencies are sensitive within the present theoretical framework to
different kinds of Lorentz violation that preserve CPT. Constraints could be
obtained on one figure of merit in the electron-positron system at the level of
$10^{-16}$, on another in the proton-antiproton system at $10^{-24}$, and on a
third at $10^{-25}$ using comparisons of $H^-$ ions with antiprotons.

another range of the resonance energy shift indicating a nonzero time variation

this range can be ruled out by including the Gd data, for which it is essential

develop, outside the horizon, growing modes leading, ultimately, to logarithmic
energy spectra which are ""red"" in frequency and increase at large distance
scales. We show that this conclusion can be evaded not only in the case of
higher dimensional backgrounds with contracting internal dimensions but also in
the case of string cosmological scenarios which are completely anisotropic in
four dimensions. In this case the logarithmic energy spectra turn out to be
""blue"" in frequency and, consequently, decreasing at large distance scales. We
elaborate on anisotropic dilaton-driven models and we argue that, incidentally,
the background models leading to (or flat) logarithmic energy spectra for
