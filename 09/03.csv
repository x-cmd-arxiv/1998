correlation and spectral analyses extracted from 33 intervals of Wind magnetic

helicity are examined, most of the datasets suggest some role of cyclotron
resonant dissipative processes involving thermal protons. We postulate that an
active spectral cascade into the dissipation range is balanced by a combination
of cyclotron-resonant and non-cyclotron-resonant kinetic dissipation
mechanisms, of which only the former induces a magnetic helicity signature. A
rate balance theory, constrained by the data, suggests that the ratio of the
two mechanisms is of order unity. While highly simplified, this approach
appears to account for several observed features, and explains why complete
cyclotron absorption, and the corresponding pure magnetic helicity signature,
is usually not observed.

  GRBs in this model have special intrinsic properties, that can either falsify

detection of a SN about the same time as the luminous GRB event. Most GRBs and

prime-focus camera on the Palomar 5m telescope. The apparent I-band luminosity
function of stars in the halo of IC 10 shows an identifiable rise at I~21.7
mag. This is interpreted as being the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) at
M_V~-4 mag. Since IC 10 is at a very low Galactic latitude, its foreground
extinction is expected to be high and the uncertainty associated with that
correction is the largest contributor to the error associated with its distance
determination. Multi-wavelength observations of Cepheid variable stars in IC 10
give a Population I distance modulus of 24.1 +- 0.2 mag, which corresponds to a
linear distance of 660 +- 66 kpc for a total line-of-sight reddening of E(B-V)
= 1.16 +- 0.08 mag, derived self-consistently from the Cepheid data alone.
Applying this Population I reddening to the Population II halo stars gives a
TRGB distance modulus of 23.5 +- 0.2 mag, corresponding to 500 +- 50 kpc. We
consider this to be a lower limit on the TRGB distance. Reconciling the Cepheid
and TRGB distances would require that the reddening to the halo is
$\Delta$E(B-V) = 0.31 mag lower than that into the main body of the galaxy.
This then suggests that the Galactic extinction in the direction of IC10 is
(B-V) ~ 0.85.

kpc from the center and move with a velocity dispersion of 140+/-35 km/s in the
line of sight. Seven of the clusters show strong Balmer absorption lines in
their spectra [EW(H-beta)= 6-13 Angstrom], while the eighth lies in a giant HII
region and shows no detectable absorption features.
  Based on comparisons with model-cluster spectra by Bruzual & Charlot (1996)
and Bressan, Chiosi, & Tantalo (1996), six of the absorption-line clusters have
ages in the range of 400-600 Myr, indicating that they formed early on during
the recent merger. These clusters are globular clusters as judged by their
small effective radii and ages corresponding to ~100 core crossing times. The
one emission-line object is <10 Myr old and may be a nascent globular cluster
or an OB association.
  The mean metallicities measured for three clusters are solar to within
+/-0.15 dex, suggesting that the merger of two likely Sc galaxies in NGC 7252
formed a globular-cluster system with a bimodal metallicity distribution. Since
NGC 7252 itself shows the characteristics of a 0.5-1 Gyr old protoelliptical,
its second-generation solar-metallicity globulars provide direct evidence that
giant ellipticals with bimodal globular-cluster systems can form through major
mergers of gas-rich disk galaxies.

dust extinction we constructed a Gaussian smoothed map of the infrared
extinction measured by Alves et al. (1998) at the same angular resolution
(50'') as our molecular--line observations. This enabled a direct comparison of
C18O integrated intensities and column densities with dust extinction over a
relatively large range of cloud depth (2 < Av < 30 mag) at 240 positions inside
L977. We find a good linear correlation between these two column density
tracers for cloud depths corresponding to Av < ~10 magnitudes. For cloud depths
above this threshold there is a notable break in the linear correlation.
Although either optically thick C18O emission or extremely low (Tex < 5 K)
excitation temperatures at high extinctions could produce this departure from
linearity, CO depletion in the denser, coldest regions of L977 may be the most
likely cause of the break in the observed correlation. We directly derive the
C18O abundance in this cloud over a broad range of cloud depths and find it to
be virtually the same as that derived for IC 5146 from the data of Lada et al.
(1994).
  In regions of very high extinction (Av > 10 mag), such as dense cores, our
results suggest that C18O would be a very poor tracer of mass. Consequently,
using C18O as a column density tracer in molecular clouds can lead to a 10 to
30% underestimation of overall cloud mass.
  We estimate the minimum total column density required to shield C18O from the
interstellar radiation field to be 1.6 +/- 0.5 magnitudes of visual extinction.

they are about 2.5mag too faint to be regarded as genuine AGB stars, if located

these carbon stars are related to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (SDG;
m-M=17.0mag). They are in that case not old and metal-rich, but young, ~0.1
Gyr, with SMC-like metallicity. The sigma_RV=113+/-14 km/s radial velocity
dispersion of the stars appears to be consistent with bulge membership. On the
other hand, a similar velocity dispersion could be the result from an induced
star formation event when the SDG crosses the galactic midplane. It is
suggested that the carbon stars are tracers of such an event and that they
therefore are located at distances related to the SDG. However, the majority of
the carbon stars are not member of the SDG, nor are they similar to the C-stars
which are member of the SDG. The radial velocities can be used to determine a
possible membership to the SDG. However, they do not give information about the
distance of the stars. In particular, if the stars are located at a distance
comparable to the SDG. This implies that only the period-luminosity relation
can be used to distinguish unambiguously if the carbon stars are located at
bulge-like or SDG-like distances. Thus far only carbon stars with reliable
periods have been identified at a SDG related distance.

rather uncertain since the correct formula describing irradiation is not well

  in X-ray astronomy', held in Garching, June 1998; B. Aschenbach et al. (eds.)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  NGC 5905 is one of the very few galaxies that underwent a giant X-ray
outburst, with a change in photon countrate of a factor 100. The outburst
spectrum is both, very soft and luminous (Bade, Komossa & Dahlem 1996).
Remarkably, the optical pre-outburst emission line spectrum of NGC 5905 is that
of an HII-type galaxy, i.e. does not show any signs of Seyfert activity.
  One exciting explanation of the X-ray observation is that we may have
witnessed the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole (SMBH)
residing in the nucleus of this galaxy. The expected flare of electromagnetic
radiation being produced when the stellar debris is swallowed by the black hole
was proposed by Rees (1988) as a means of tracing SMBHs in nearby non-active
galaxies.
  In the present work, we discuss this and other possible outburst scenarios
through an analysis of all ROSAT PSPC and HRI X-ray observations of NGC 5905.
We also present simultaneous and long-term optical photometry of NGC 5905 as
well as follow-up optical spectroscopy.

  text",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  A study of magneto-transport through quantum dots is presented. The model
allows to analyze tunnelling both from bulk-like contacts and from 2D
accumulation layers. The fine features in the I-V characteristics due to the
quantum dot states are known to be shifted to different voltages depending upon
the value of the magnetic field. While this effect is also well reproduced by
our calculations, in this work we concentrate on the amplitude of each current
resonance as a function of the magnetic field. Such amplitudes show
oscillations reflecting the variation of the density of states at the Fermi
energy in the emitter. Furthermore the amplitude increases as a function of the
magnetic field for certain features while it decreases for others. In
particular we demonstrate that the behaviour of the amplitude of the current
resonances is linked to the value of the angular momentum of each dot level
through which tunnelling occurs. We show that a selection rule on the angular
momentum must be satisfied. As a consequence, tunnelling through specific dot
states is strongly suppresses and sometimes prohibited altogether by the
presence of the magnetic field. This will allow to extract from the
experimental curves detailed information on the nature of the quantum dot
wavefunctions involved in the electronic transport. Furthermore, when
tunnelling occurs from a 2D accumulation layer to the quantum dot, the presence
of a magnetic field hugely increases the strength of some resonant features.
This effect is predicted by our model and, to the best of our knowledge, has
never been observed.

Meissner screening at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the
linear diamagnetic susceptibility data is successfully described by the
quasiclassical Eilenberger theory including elastic scattering characterised by
a mean free path l. Using the mean free path as the only fit parameter we found
values of l in the range 0.1-1 of the normal metal layer thickness d_N, which
are in rough agreement with the ones obtained from residual resistivity
measurements. The fits are satisfactory over the whole temperature range
between 5 mK and 7 K for values of d_N varying between 1.6 my m and 30 my m.
Although a finite mean free path is necessary to correctly describe the
temperature dependence of the linear response diamagnetic susceptibility, the
measured breakdown fields in the nonlinear regime follow the temperature and
thickness dependence given by the clean limit theory. However, there is a
discrepancy in the absolute values. We argue that in order to reach
quantitative agreement one needs to take into account the mean free path from
the fits of the linear response. [PACS numbers: 74.50.+r, 74.80.-g]

  The ACM and the transistor were born in 1947. At that time the stored program
computer was a revolutionary idea and the transistor was just a curiosity. Both
ideas evolved rapidly. By the mid 1960s integrated circuits appeared --
allowing mass fabrication of transistors on silicon substrates. This allowed
low-cost mass-produced computers. These technologies enabled extraordinary
increases in processing speed and memory coupled with extraordinary price
declines.
  The only form of processing and memory more easily, cheaply, and rapidly
fabricated is the human brain. Peter Cohrane (1996) estimates the brain to have
a processing power of around 1000 million-million operations per second, (one
Petaops) and a memory of 10 Terabytes. If current trends continue, computers

Abelian axial anomaly. However, these problems are resolved in the consistently
coupled Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter approach. Using one of the most
successful variants of this approach, we find the dynamically dressed
propagators of the light u and d quarks, as well as the heavy c and b quarks,
and find the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes for their bound states pi0, eta_c and
\eta_b. Thanks to incorporating the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, the
pion simultaneously appears as the (pseudo)Goldstone boson. We give the
theoretical predictions for the gamma-gamma decay widths of pi0, eta_c and
eta_b, and for the pi0 gamma* -> gamma transition form factor, and compare them
with experiment. In the chiral limit, the axial-anomaly result for
pi0->gamma-gamma is reproduced analytically in the consistently coupled
Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter approach, provided that the quark-photon
vertex is dressed consistently with the quark propagator, so that the vector
Ward-Takahashi identity of QED is obeyed. On the other hand, the present
approach is also capable of quantitatively describing systems of heavy quarks,
concretely eta_c and possibly eta_b, and their gamma-gamma decays. We discuss
the reasons for the broad phenomenological success of the bound-state approach

hypercharge generator which is consistent with the Gell-Mann--Nishijima
relation appears to be an element of the su(2)_{cs}*u(1) subalgebra as it
contains the unit matrix generating the baryon number current. In considering
now hypercharge axial transformations, the u(1) generator will give rise to the
anomalous U(1)_A axial current and the resulting hypercharge axial current will
be anomalous, too. The only anomaly free neutral strong axial current having a
well defined chiral limit turns out to be identical (up to a constant factor)
with the weak axial current, and the eta meson acquires features of a `masked'
strange Goldstone boson. The eta N and f_1(1420)N couplings will now proceed
via a purely strange isosinglet axial current and appear strongly suppressed
relative to the predictions of the octet quark model. For this reason, loop
corrections like the a_0\pi N and KK^*Y triangles to the respective eta NN and

function which is used for evaluation of the exclusive modes. We predict the
partial rates for 74 exclusive SL and NL channels and 43 inclusive partial
rates corresponding to the underlying $\bar{b}\to \bar{c}$ and $c\to s$ quark
decays. Based on our approach we find $\Gamma^{\bar{b}}(B_c)= 0.52 \pm 0.02
ps^{-1}$, $\Gamma^{c}(B_c)= 0.98 \pm 0.07 ps^{-1}$, where the theoretical
uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the choice of the threshold
values at which the hadron continuum starts. For the $B_c$ lifetime we obtain
$\tau_{B_c}= 0.63 \pm 0.02 ps$ in a good agreement with the prediction obtained
using the nonrelativistic operator product expansion. We also predict decay
rates for many specific weak transitions of $B_c$. In particular, for the

Fourier transform, has been shown to be a powerful tool in developing quantum
algorithms. However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary
transforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the
Fourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale
structure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing
and quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive efficient, complete,
quantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum
Haar and quantum Daubechies $D^{(4)}$ transforms. Our approach is to factor the
operators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot
products of unitary matrices. In so doing, we find that permutation matrices, a
particular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we
find that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are
not always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice
versa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation
matrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly.
However, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed
explicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the
quantum transform. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices
arising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits
that implement them. This allows us to design efficient, complete quantum
circuits for the quantum wavelet transform.
