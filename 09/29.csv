mass resolution allows dark matter (DM) halos to survive in the tidal fields in
high-density regions and thus prevents the ambiguities related with the
``overmerging problem.'' Numbers of galaxy-size halos in cluster-like objects
in our simulation are similar to the numbers of galaxies observed in real
clusters. This allows us to estimate for the first time the evolution of the
correlation function and bias at small (down to ~100/h kpc) scales. We compare
particle distribution, dark matter correlation function, density profiles, and
halo mass function produced with our N-body code and corresponding results of
the AP3M simulations.
  We find that at all epochs the 2-point correlation function of galaxy-size
halos xihh is well approximated by a power-law with slope ~1.6-1.8. The
difference between the shape of xihh and the shape of the correlation function
of matter results in the scale-dependent bias at scales <7/h Mpc, which we find
to be a generic prediction of the hierarchical models, independent of the epoch
and of the model details. We find that our results agree well with existing
clustering data at different redshifts, indicating the general success of the
picture of structure formation in which galaxies form inside the host DM halos.
Particularly, we find an excellent agreement in both slope and the amplitude
between xihh(z=0) in our simulation and the galaxy correlation function
measured using the APM galaxy survey. At high redshifts, the observed
clustering of the Lyman-break galaxies is also reasonably well reproduced by

distribution to determine the ""bias"" defined as $b\equiv (\delta

metallicity and with increasing redshift of observations. At the $8h^{-1}$Mpc
fiducial comoving scale bias (for bright regions) is 1.35 at $z=0$ reaching to

been raised whether such disks have a continuum of unstable linear modes or
perhaps no unstable modes at all. We resolve this paradox by analysing the
particular case of a gaseous, isentropic disk with a completely flat rotation
curve (the Mestel disk) exactly. The heart of the matter is this: what are the
correct boundary conditions to impose at the origin or central cusp? We argue
that the linear stability problem is ill-posed. From any finite radius, waves
reach the origin after finite time but with logarithmically divergent phase.
Instabilities exist, but their pattern speeds depend upon an undetermined phase
with which waves are reflected from the origin. For any definite choice of this
phase, there is an infinite but discrete set of growing modes. Similar
ambiguities may afflict general disk models with power-law central cusps. The
ratio of growth rate to pattern speed, however, is independent of the central
phase. This ratio is derived in closed form for non self-gravitating normal
modes. The ratio for self-gravitating normal modes is found numerically by
solving recurrence relations in Mellin-transform space.

glass at a temperature where, in equilibrium, there are presumed to be (two or

locally, either it never settles permanently on a fixed lengthscale into a
single pure state, or it does but then the pure state depends on both the
initial spin configuration and the realization of the stochastic dynamics. But
this latter case can occur only if there exists an uncountable number of pure
states (for each coupling realization) with almost every pair having zero
overlap. In both cases, almost no initial spin configuration is in the basin of
attraction of a single pure state; that is, the configuration space (resulting
from a deep quench) is all boundary (except for a set of measure zero). We
prove that the former case holds for deeply quenched two-dimensional
ferromagnets. Our results raise the possibility that even if more than one pure
state exists for an infinite system, time averages don't necessarily disagree

binary mixture has a demixing transition for edge-length ratios below 0.1.
Freezing in this mixture reveals that at least the phase rich in large cubes
lies in the region where the uniform fluid is unstable, hence suggesting a
fluid-solid phase separation. A method is develop to study very asymmetric
binary mixtures by taking the limit of zero size ratio (scaling the density and
fugacity of the solvent as appropriate) in the semi-grand ensemble where the
chemical potential of the solvent is fixed. With this procedure the mixture is
exactly mapped onto a one-component fluid of parallel adhesive hard cubes. At
any density and solvent fugacity the large cubes are shown to collapse into a
close-packed solid. Nevertheless the phase diagram contains a large
metastability region with fluid and solid phases. Upon introduction of a slight
polydispersity in the large cubes the system shows the typical phase diagram of
a fluid with an isostructural solid-solid transition (with the exception of a
continuous freezing). Consequences about the phase behavior of binary mixtures

Molecular Dynamics. While the dynamics of both models differ for short length

both models behave similarly. In particular, the mode coupling theory of the

field theory are nonuniversal whereas those of the lattice theory are
independent of the nonuniversal model parameters.One-loop results for
finite-size scaling functions are derived. Their structure disagrees with the
single-variable scaling form of the lowest-mode approximation for any finite
$\xi/L$ where $\xi$ is the bulk correlation length. At $T_c$, the large-$L$
behavior becomes lowest-mode like for the lattice model but not for the
field-theoretic model. Characteristic temperatures close to $T_c$ of the
lattice model, such as $T_{max}(L)$ of the maximum of the susceptibility
$\chi$, are found to scale asymptotically as $T_c - T_{max}(L) \sim L^{-d/2}$,
in agreement with previous Monte Carlo (MC) data for the five-dimensional Ising
model. We also predict $\chi_{max} \sim L^{d/2}$ asymptotically. On a
quantitative level, the asymptotic amplitudes of this large -$L$ behavior close
to $T_c$ have not been observed in previous MC simulations at $d = 5$ because
of nonnegligible finite-size terms $\sim L^{(4-d)/2}$ caused by the
inhomogeneous modes. These terms identify the possible origin of a significant
discrepancy between the lowest-mode approximation and previous MC data. MC data

mesons and the relative production rates for different types of D meson pairs.
We see slight correlations between the longitudinal momenta of the D and the
$\bar D$, and significant correlations between the azimuthal angle of the D and
the $\bar D$. The experimental distributions are compared to a
next-to-leading-order QCD calculation and to predictions of the {\sc
Pythia/Jetset} Monte Carlo event generator. We observe less correlation between
transverse momenta and different correlations between longitudinal momenta than
these models predict for the default values of the model parameters. Better
agreement between data and theory might be achieved by tuning the model
parameters or by adding higher order perturbative terms, thus contributing to a
better understanding of charm production.
  The relative production rates for the four sets of charm pairs,
$D^0\bar{D}^{0}$, $D^0D^-$, $D^+\bar{D}^{0}$, $D^+D^-$, as calculated in the
{\sc Pythia/Jetset} event generator with the default parameters, agree with
data as far as the relative ordering, but predict too many $D^+\bar{D}^{0}$
pairs and too few $D^+D^-$ pairs.

sources in the waveguiding structures with bianisotropic media is developed.
Effect of electric, magnetic, and magneto- electric losses in such media
manifests itself in the special form of eigenmode orthogonality referred to as
the quasi-orthogonality relation. It reflects the existence of the cross-power
flow and for any pair of modes which are rigidly linked to each other by this
relation. The quasi-orthogonality relation remains true in the limiting case of
lossless waveguides yielding the customary relations of orthogonality and
normalization for propagating (active) modes and also their generalization for
nonpropagating (reactive) modes. It is shown that the eigenmode set for a
waveguiding structure is complete only outside the region of exciting sources.
Inside this region the modal expansions of fields are incomplete and must be
supplemented with the orthogonal complementary fields which extend the proper
Hilbert space spanned by waveguide eigenfunctions. Among exciting sources there
are the external bulk sources (currents, fields, and medium perturbations) and
the external surface currents. Besides, the orthogonal complementary fields
generate the effective surface currents on boundaries of the bulk exciting
sources. The problem of waveguide excitation by external sources is solved by
means of determining both the mode amplitudes for the modal field expansions
and the orthogonal complementary fields inside the source region. The equations
of mode excitation are derived on the basis of three approaches applying the
direct use of Maxwell's equations, the electrodynamic analogy with the
mathematical method of variation of constants, and the conjugate reciprocity
theorem.

surrounding (electrically) charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. At
the Plank scale, there exists a quantized, absolute 3D space and separate
(quantized) time which is not affected by motion or gravity. Light is the
simple shifting of a photon information pattern from cell to adjacent cell at
every CA 'clock cycle'. The Lorentz transformation is derived from our simple
model of light motion. Inertial mass is revised to acknowledge the absolute
nature of mass and acceleration. The same electromagnetic quantum vacuum forces
are also present in masses inside a gravitational field, where now the quantum
vacuum is accelerated with respect to the mass by graviton exchanges. This
process is responsible for the equivalence principle (WEP), which is derived in
detail. Gravity is found to be based on two boson force exchange particles: the
graviton and the photon, and both particles are postulated to be almost
identical in physical characteristics. 4D space-time curvature is found to
result from a 'Fizeau-like' scattering process, where the accelerated
(electrically charged) virtual particles of the quantum vacuum act like a
special 'Fizeau fluid'. Light scatters with the electrically charged and
accelerated 'Fizeau fluid', resulting in curved paths. Four experimental tests
