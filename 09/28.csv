(magnetorotational) instability of a weak, vertical magnetic field within a

analysis is undertaken for the case that the wave vector of the perturbation is
parallel to the magnetic field.
  The growth rate depends on whether the initial magnetic field is parallel or
antiparallel to the angular momentum of the disc. The parallel case is less
(more) unstable than the antiparallel case if the Hall current is dominated by
negative (positive) species. The less-unstable orientation is stable for chi
less than about 0.5, where chi is the ratio of a generalised neutral-ion
collision frequency to the Keplerian frequency. The other orientation has a
formal growth rate of order the Keplerian angular frequency even in the limit
that chi tends to zero! In this limit the wavelength of the fastest growing
mode tends to infinity, so the minimum level of ionization for instability is
determined by the requirement that a wavelength fit within a disc scale height.
In the ambipolar diffusion case, this requires chi > v_A/c_s; in the Hall case
this imposes a potentially much weaker limit, chi > v_A^2 / c_s^2.

consistent with a distribution of column densities varying as the total
galactic absorption in the direction of each of the bursts (chi^2 =9.6 for 6

GRB occur within host galaxies. By simultaneously fitting a power-law spectral

on a toral phase space. In the framework of this phase space, a quantum state
must satisfy Bloch boundary conditions (BCs) on a torus and the spectrum
consists of a finite number of levels for given BCs. As the BCs are varied, a
level broadens into a band. The BHD for a band is defined as the uniform
average of the Husimi distributions for all the eigenstates in the band. The
generalized BHD for a set of adjacent bands is the average of the BHDs
associated with these bands. BHDs are shown to be closer, in several aspects,
to classical distributions than Husimi distributions for individual
eigenstates. The generalized BHD for two adjacent bands is shown to be
approximately conserved in the passage through a degeneracy between the bands
as a nonintegrability parameter is varied. Finally, it is shown how generalized
BHDs can be defined so as to achieve physical continuity under small variations
of the scaled Planck constant. A generalization of the topological
(Chern-index) characterization of the classical-quantum correspondence is then
obtained.

This complex
multi-faceted question encompasses such qualitative bonus as satisfying natural
human curiosity, the quest for knowledge and the impact on education and
culture, but one of its most scrutinized component reduces to the assessment of
economic performance and wealth creation derived from research. In certain
areas such as biotechnology, semi-conductor physics, optical communications,
the impact of basic research is direct while, in other disciplines, the path
from discovery to applications is full of surprises. As a consequence, there
are persistent uncertainties in the quantification of the exact economic
returns of public expenditure on basic research. Here, we suggest that these
uncertainties have a fundamental origin to be found in the interplay between
the intrinsic ``fat tail'' power law nature of the distribution of economic
returns, characterized by a mathematically diverging variance, and the
stochastic character of discovery rates. In the regime where the cumulative
economic wealth derived from research is expected to exhibit a long-term
positive trend, we show that strong fluctuations blur out significantly the
short-time scales: a few major unpredictable innovations may provide a finite
fraction of the total creation of wealth. In such a scenario, any attempt to
assess the economic impact of research over a finite time horizon encompassing
only a small number of major discoveries is bound to be highly unreliable. New
tools, developed in the theory of self-similar and complex systems to tackle
similar extreme fluctuations in Nature can be adapted to measure the economic
benefits of research, which is intimately associated to this large variability.

demonstrate also that the linearized in density Brueckner equations give the

powers of the density, combined with the scaling hypothesis, give $\nu\approx

determine the likelihood of a given word combination. For example, a speech
recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations ``eat a
peach'' and ``eat a beach'' is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine
the likelihood of a word combination from its frequency in a training corpus.
However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are
infrequent and do not occur in any given corpus. In this work we propose a
method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word
combinations using available information on ``most similar'' words.
  We describe probabilistic word association models based on distributional
word similarity, and apply them to two tasks, language modeling and pseudo-word
disambiguation. In the language modeling task, a similarity-based model is used
to improve probability estimates for unseen bigrams in a back-off language
model. The similarity-based method yields a 20% perplexity improvement in the
prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in
speech-recognition error.
  We also compare four similarity-based estimation methods against back-off and
maximum-likelihood estimation methods on a pseudo-word sense disambiguation
task in which we controlled for both unigram and bigram frequency to avoid
giving too much weight to easy-to-disambiguate high-frequency configurations.
The similarity-based methods perform up to 40% better on this particular task.

characterization of LOGCFL, we lay the groundwork for a deeper investigation.
Specifically, we examine subclasses of LOGCFL arising from varying the arity

relating monoidal quantifiers to NC1 and its subclasses. In the absence of the
BIT predicate, we resolve the main issues: we show in particular that no single
outermost unary groupoidal quantifier with FO can capture all the context-free
languages, and we obtain the surprising result that a variant of Greibach's
``hardest context-free language'' is LOGCFL-complete under quantifier-free
BIT-free projections. We then prove that FO with unary groupoidal quantifiers
is strictly more expressive with the BIT predicate than without. Considering a
particular groupoidal quantifier, we prove that first-order logic with majority
of pairs is strictly more expressive than first-order with majority of
individuals. As a technical tool of independent interest, we define the notion
of an aperiodic nondeterministic finite automaton and prove that FO
translations are precisely the mappings computed by single-valued aperiodic
nondeterministic finite transducers.
