from the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS, Rengelink et al. 1997), has
been imaged in the optical and near infrared, resulting in an identification
fraction of 87%. The R-I and R-K colours of the faint optical counterparts are
as expected for passively evolving elliptical galaxies, assuming that they
follow the R band Hubble diagram as determined for radio-bright GPS galaxies.
We have found evidence that the radio spectral properties of the GPS quasars
are different from those of GPS galaxies: The observed distribution of radio
spectral peak frequencies for GPS sources optically identified with bright
stellar objects (presumably quasars) is shifted compared with GPS sources
identified with faint or extended optical objects (presumably galaxies), in the
sense that a GPS quasar is likely to have a higher peak frequency than a GPS
galaxy. This means that the true peak frequency distribution is different for
the GPS galaxies and quasars, because the sample selection effects are
independent of optical identification. The correlation between peak frequency
and redshift as has been suggested for bright sources has not been found in
this sample; no correlation exists between R magnitude (and therefore redshift)
and peak frequency for the GPS galaxies. We therefore believe that the claimed
correlation is actually caused by the dependence of the peak frequency on
optical host, because the GPS galaxies are in general at lower redshifts than
the quasars. The difference in the peak frequency distributions of the GPS
galaxies and quasars is further evidence against the hypothesis that they form
a single class of object.

an abrupt change in the connectivity of the vortex tangle across the

Josephson junctions with small capacitance. If the charging energy of a
junction is of the order of the Josephson energy, the fluctuations of the
superconducting order parameter in the system are considerable, and the
vortices behave as quantum particles. Their density may be tuned by an external
magnetic field, and therefore one can control the commensurability of the
one-dimensional vortex lattice with the lattice of Josephson junctions. We show
that the interplay between the quantum nature of a vortex, and the long-range
interaction between the vortices leads to the existence of a specific
commensurate-incommensurate transition in a one-dimensional vortex lattice. In
the commensurate phase an elementary excitation is a soliton, with energy
separated from the ground state by a finite gap. This gap vanishes in the
incommensurate phase. Each soliton carries a fraction of a flux quantum; the
propagation of solitons leads to a finite resistance of the array. We find the
dependence of the resistance activation energy on the magnetic field and
parameters of the Josephson array. This energy consists of the above-mentioned
gap, and also of a boundary pinning term, which is different in the
commensurate and incommensurate phases. The developed theory allows us to
explain quantitatively the available experimental data.

Multiplicity distributions of the fast-moving projectile fragments are inves-

terms of the total charge remaining bound in the multiply charged projectile
fragments. Some differences in the average yields of helium nuclei and heavier

designed to estimate an arbitrary continuous-time Markov diffusion process X

different from the much-used Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and its second-order
variants, even in the simplest nonlinear case, in that: (i) It uses a quadratic
function of a vector observation to update the state, instead of the linear
function used by the EKF. (ii) It is based on deeper geometric principles,
which make the GI Filter coordinate-invariant. This implies, for example, that
if a linear system were subjected to a nonlinear transformation f of the
state-space and analyzed using the GI Filter, the resulting state estimates and
conditional variances would be the push-forward under f of the Kalman Filter
estimates for the untransformed system - a property which is not shared by the

algorithm with reference to a specific example - the problem of tracking and
intercepting a target, using sensors based on a moving missile. Computational

also show how formulas for the Poincare polynomial and the Euler characteristic
(equivalent to those of Kirwan) can be expressed in the same recursive manner.

pushforward in K-theory, and use Lerman's symplectic cutting and the
localization theorem in equivariant K-theory to prove that quantization
commutes with reduction. Only the case where the action is free on the zero
level set of the moment map is addressed.

decomposition of the tangent bundle T(X) comes from a splitting of the
universal covering space of X as a product of manifolds, in such a way that the
given decomposition of T(X) lifts to the canonical decomposition of the tangent
bundle of a product. We prove this assertion when X is a Kaehler-Einstein
manifold or a Kaehler surface. Simple examples show that the Kaehler hypothesis
is necessary.

regarding the energies of neighboring mirror nuclei. We find that, for a
quantitative explanation of the NS anomaly, it is crucial to include CSB in
partial waves with $L>0$ (besides $^1S_0$) as derived from a microscopic model
for CSB of the NN interaction.

the dynamics of fluctuations. Finally, open problems are addressed, like the
use of thermodynamic concepts at smaller excitations, the ergodicity question,
the variation of transport coefficients with the nuclear shape due to shell
