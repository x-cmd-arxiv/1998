clouds in spherical halos. We use the Press-Schechter model for the abundance
of halos, and assume that each halo has a similar population of clouds, with
total mass and spatial distribution constrained to fit observations of the
column density distribution. We show that the kinematics of the multiple
absorbing components revealed in absorption profiles of the low-ionization
lines, presented by Prochaska & Wolfe, are consistent with our spherical halo
model.
  The presence of multiple absorbing components with a large covering factor,
combined with the small impact parameters of the systems predicted in our
analytical model and in numerical simulations, implies a high rate of energy
dissipation in cloud collisions. We calculate the rate of energy dissipation in
our model, and show that it is far greater than the rate at which energy can be
supplied by gravitational mergers of halos. This poses a problem for the model
of merging protogalactic clumps of Haehnelt et al., based on numerical
simulations. We also present new constraints on the amplitude of the power
spectrum in hierarchical theories required to account for the observed velocity
dispersion in the absorbers. We find that the linearly extrapolated rms
fluctuation on spheres of radius HR = 100 km/s at z=4 must be greater than
0.75. Although this limit is obtained only for our specific model of the
absorbing components, it should not be highly model-dependent because the
velocity dispersion of the absorbers is essentially determined by the velocity
dispersion of the halos where the gas is moving.

bright ``bulge''on ground-based images. In addition, while some PSB galaxies
exhibit distinct spiral structure, on the whole they have smoother morphologies
than the SB galaxies. The morphologies and luminosity profiles are generally
consistent with substantial starbursts in the form of centralized spiral

An important point is that the PSB galaxies retain disks, i.e, they have not
evolved into spheroidal systems.

naturally lead to a logic programming system that offers an interesting
alternative to more traditional logic programming styles of Horn logic
programming, stratified logic programming and logic programming with
well-founded semantics. The proposed approach is based on the interpretation of
program clauses as constraints. In this setting programs do not describe a
single intended model, but a family of stable models. These stable models
encode solutions to the constraint satisfaction problem described by the
program. Our approach imposes restrictions on the syntax of logic programs. In
particular, function symbols are eliminated from the language. We argue that
the resulting logic programming system is well-attuned to problems in the class
NP, has a well-defined domain of applications, and an emerging methodology of
programming. We point out that what makes the whole approach viable is recent
progress in implementations of algorithms to compute stable models of

quasi-isometric to each other but have the same quasi-isometry group. Namely,
PSL(2,Z[1/p]) and PSL(2,Z[1/q]) are not quasi-isometric unless p=q, and,
independent of p, the quasi-isometry group of PSL(2,Z[1/p]) is PSL(2,Q). In
addition, we characterize PSL(2,Z[1/p]) uniquely among all finitely generated
groups by its quasi-isometry type.

  format. The paper will appear in Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.58.7928",,"patt-sol nlin.PS",,"  A general method to find an effective potential of interaction between far
separated 2D and 3D solitons is elaborated, including the case of 2D vortex
solitons. The method is based on explicit calculation of the overlapping term
in the full Hamiltonian of the system (_without_ assuming that the ``tail'' of
each soliton is not affected by its interaction with the other soliton, and, in
fact,_without_ knowing the exact form of the solution for an isolated soliton -
the latter problem is circumvented by reducing a bulk integral to a surface
one). The result is obtained in an explicit form that does not contain an
artificially introduced radius of the overlapping region. The potential applies
to spatial and spatiotemporal solitons in nonlinear optics, where it may help
to solve various dynamical problems: collisions, formation of bound states
(BS's), etc. In particular, an orbiting BS of two solitons is always unstable.
In the presence of weak dissipation and gain, the effective potential can also
be derived, giving rise to bound states similar to those recently studied in 1D
models.

Fabry-Perot cavities in laser gravitational wave detectors. The method is based
on the vernier, which occurs naturally when the laser incident on the cavity
has a sideband. By changing the length of the cavity over several wavelengths
we obtain a set of carrier resonances alternating with sideband resonances.
  From the measurement of the separation between the carrier and a sideband
resonance we determine the length of the cavity. We apply the technique to the
measurement of the length of a Fabry-Perot cavity in the Caltech 40m
Interferometer and discuss the accuracy of the technique.

correcting and avoiding quantum errors may yield better codes. We give a
