life of the IUE satellite. We analyze the variability properties of the light
curves, and find that two variable components, written B and R respectively,
must contribute to the blue-bump emission in this object. The B component
produces most of the variability in the ultraviolet domain. A maximum time
scale of variability of about 2 yr identical at all wavelengths is found. If
discrete events produce this component, the event rate is ~3-30 yr^-1. Assuming
an isotropic emission, each event must liberate about 10^51 erg in the form of
optical-to-ultraviolet radiation. The spectral properties of the B component
suggest that reprocessing on a truncated disk, or partially- thick
bremsstrahlung may be the emission mechanism. We find evidence of a lag of a
few days between the light curves of the B component at optical and ultraviolet
wavelengths. Neither the variability properties, nor the spectral properties of
the R component can be accurately measured. This component varies on very long
time scales, and may completely dominate the historical light curve of 3C 273
in the optical domain. Combining knowledge from other wavelengths, we obtain
several indications that this component could reveal the ``blazar'' 3C 273. In
particular, its light curve is very similar to the hard X-ray light curve.

field strengths above $B_0\sim 3\times 10^{13}$ Gauss naturally raises the
question of whether this forms an upper limit to pulsar magnetization. Recently
there has been increasing evidence that neutron stars possessing higher dipole
spin-down fields do in fact exist, including a growing list of anomalous X-ray
pulsars (AXPs) with long periods and spinning down with high period
derivatives, implying surface fields of $10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ Gauss.
Furthermore, the recently reported X-ray period and period derivative for the
Soft Gamma-ray Repeater (SGR) source SGR1806-20 suggest a surface field around
$10^{15}$ Gauss. None of these high-field pulsars have yet been detected as
radio pulsars. We propose that high-field pulsars should be radio-quiet because
electron-positron pair production in their magnetospheres, thought to be
essential for radio emission, is efficiently suppressed in ultra-strong fields
($B_0\gtrsim 4\times 10^{13}$ Gauss) by the action of photon splitting, a
quantum electrodynamical process in which a photon splits into two. Our
computed radio quiescence boundary in the radio pulsar $P-\dot P$ diagram,
where photon splitting overtakes pair creation, is located just above the
boundary of the known radio pulsar population, neatly dividing them from the
AXPs. We thus identify a physical mechanism that defines a new class of
high-field radio-quiet neutron stars that should be detectable by their pulsed
emission at X-ray and perhaps $\gamma$-ray energies.

binary by (Jeffries et al. 1995). We present here high resolution echelle

January 1998 using the 2.1m telescope at McDonald Observatory. These
observations reveal it is a double-lined spectroscopic binary. A dramatic
increase in the chromospheric emissions (H_alpha and Ca II IRT lines) is
detected during the observations. Several arguments favor the interpretation of
this behavior as an unusual long-duration flare. First the temporal evolution
of the event is similar to the observed in other solar and stellar flares, with
an initial impulsive phase characterized by a strong increase in the
chromospheric lines (the H_alpha EW change in a factor of 5 in only one day)
and thereafter, the line emission decreased gradually over several days.
Second, a broad component in the H_alpha line profile is observed just at the
beginning of the event. Third, the detection of the He I D_{3} in emission and
a filled-in He I 6678 A. We detect a Li I 6708 A line enhancement which is
clearly related with the temporal evolution of the flare. The maximum Li I
enhancement occurs just after the maximum chromospheric emission observed in
the flare. We suggest that this Li I is produced by spallation reactions in the
flare. This is the first time that such LiI enhancement associate with a
stellar flare is reported, and probably the long-duration of this flare is a
key factor for this detection.

the frequency shifts resulting from simple perturbations to a polytropic model

We find that although solely depth-dependent perturbations can give frequency

the perturbation strength. These results may have implications for resolving
the differences between eigenfrequencies derived from solar models and those

population is infinite and continuous variation of genotype is allowed.
Nonetheless, Waxman and Peck showed that if the degree of pleiotropy is large
enough,in this model a nonzero fraction of the population can have identical
alleles. This `condensed mode' behavior appears in the limit of infinite times.
  This paper explores the time-dependence of the distribution of alleles in
this model. First, the model is analyzed using a recursion technique which
enables the distribution of alleles to be calculated at finite times as well as
in Waxman and Peck's infinite-time limit. Second, both Waxman and Peck's
original model and a related model in which mutations occur continuously are
mapped onto problems in quantum mechanics. In both cases, the long-time
analysis for the biological model is equivalent to finding the nature of the
eigenstates of the quantum problem. The condensed mode appears if and only if
there is no bound state in the quantum problem.
  We compare the behavior of the discrete- and continuous-time versions of the
model. The results for the two cases are qualitatively similar, though there
are some quantitative differences. We also discuss our attempts to correlate
the statistics of DNA sequence variations with the degree of pleiotropy of
various genes.

the last step in the derivation of a complex formula at any stage in the proof
is always the introduction of the top-level logical symbol of that formula. We
investigate the relevance of this uniform proof notion to structuring proof
search in classical logic. A logical language in whose context provability is
equivalent to uniform provability admits of a goal-directed proof procedure
that interprets logical symbols as search directives whose meanings are given
by the corresponding inference rules. While this uniform provability property
does not hold directly of classical logic, we show that it holds of a fragment
of it that only excludes essentially positive occurrences of universal
quantifiers under a modest, sound, modification to the set of assumptions: the
addition to them of the negation of the formula being proved. We further note
that all uses of the added formula can be factored into certain derived rules.
The resulting proof system and the uniform provability property that holds of
it are used to outline a proof procedure for classical logic. An interesting
aspect of this proof procedure is that it incorporates within it previously
proposed mechanisms for dealing with disjunctive information in assumptions and
for handling hypotheticals. Our analysis sheds light on the relationship
between these mechanisms and the notion of uniform proofs.

characterization of the situations in which classical provability entails
intuitionistic provability. We then examine the relationship of these
derivability notions to uniform provability, a restriction of intuitionistic
provability that embodies a special form of goal-directedness. We determine,
first, the circumstances in which the former relations imply the latter. Using
this result, we identify the richest versions of the so-called abstract logic
programming languages in classical and intuitionistic logic. We then study the
reduction of classical and, derivatively, intuitionistic provability to uniform
provability via the addition to the assumption set of the negation of the
formula to be proved. Our focus here is on understanding the situations in
which this reduction is achieved. However, our discussions indicate the
structure of a proof procedure based on the reduction, a matter also considered
explicitly elsewhere.

improvement is applied to the one-loop effective potential (EP) in massive
scalar $\phi^4$ model at $T\neq0$. By investigating the phase structure of the
model at $T \neq 0$ we get the following observations; i) Starting from the
perturbative calculations with the theory renormalized at an arbitrary
mass-scale $\mu$ and at an arbitrary temperature $T_0$, we can in principle
fully resum terms of $O(\lambda T/\mu)$ together with terms of $O(\lambda
(T/\mu)^2)$. The key idea is to fix the arbitrary RS-parameters so as to make
both of one-loop radiative corrections to the mass as well as to the coupling
vanish, ensuring the function form of the EP to be determined up to the
next-to-leading order of large correction terms, thus absorbing completely
those terms of $O(\lambda (T/\mu)^2)$ and of $O(\lambda T/\mu)$. ii) If we
start from the theory renormalized at the temperature of the environment $T$,
the $O(\lambda (T/\mu)^2)$-term resummation can be simply completed through the
$T$-renormalization itself. With the lack of freedom we can set only one
RS-fixing condition to absorb the large terms of $O(\lambda T/\mu)$, thus only
the partial resummation of these terms can be carried out. iii) In the above
two analyses the temperature-dependent phase transition of the model is shown
with the analytic evaluation to proceed through the second order transition.
The critical exponents are estimated analytically and are compared with those
in other analyses. iv) Our resummation method does not work if we start from
the theory renormalized at T=0.

thermodynamic analysis of particle yields in relativistic heavy ion collisions

is shown that this dependence can be quantitatively well described in terms of
a thermal model with a canonical strangeness conservation. The measured
particle multiplicity ratios (pi+/p, pi-/pi+, d/p, K+/pi+ and K+/K- but not
eta/pi0) in central Au-Au and Ni-Ni collisions at 0.8 -- 2.0 A.GeV are also
explained in the context of a thermal model with a common freeze-out

to the wave packet diffusion effect is treated as a random term in a
Langevin-type equation of motion, whose numerical treatment is much easier than
the method of the previous papers. Furthermore a new approximation formula,
called the triple-loop approximation, is introduced in order to evaluate the
Hamiltonian in the equation of motion with much less computation time than the
exact calculation. A calculation is performed for the Au + Au central
collisions at 150 MeV/nucleon. The result shows that AMD almost reproduces the

general rotationally invariant potential the angular momentum decomposition
leads to a theory of Jost functions. The anyon statistics parameter gives rise
to an interpolation for angular momenta analogous to the Regge trajectories for
