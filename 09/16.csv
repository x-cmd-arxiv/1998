important in identifying the reasons for accelerated morphological
diversification early in the history of animal phyla. Here, a simple general
model describing the joint dynamics of taxonomic diversity and morphological
disparity is presented and applied to the data on the diversification of
blastozoans. I show that the observed patterns of deceleration in clade
diversification can be explicable in terms of the geometric structure of the
morphospace and the effects of extinction and speciation on morphological
disparity without invoking major declines in the size of morphological
transitions or taxonomic turnover rates. The model allows testing of hypotheses
about patterns of diversification and estimation of rates of morphological
evolution. In the case of blastozoans, I find no evidence that major changes in
evolutionary rates and mechanisms are responsible for the deceleration of
morphological diversification seen during the period of this clade's expansion.
At the same time, there is evidence for a moderate decline in overall rates of
morphological diversification concordant with a major change (from positive to
negative values) in the clade's growth rate.

synthesis occurs in all types of SNe, the contribution to the CGB is dominated
by SNIa events due to their higher photon escape probabilities. Estimates of
the star formation history in the universe suggest a rapid increase by a factor
\~ 10 from the present to a redshift z_p ~ 1.5, beyond which it either remains
constant or decreases slowly. We integrate the observed star formation history
to determine the CGB from the corresponding SN rate history. In addition to
gamma-rays from short-lived radioactivity in SNIa and SNII/Ibc we also
calculate the minor contributions from long-lived radioactivities (26Al, 44Ti,
60Co, and electron-positron pair annihilation). Although progenitor evolution
for SNIa is not yet fully understood, various arguments suggest delays of order
1-2 Gy between star formation and the production of SNIa's. The effect of this
delay on the CGB is discussed. We emphasize the value of gamma-ray observations
of the CGB in the MeV range as an independent tool for studies of the cosmic
star formation history. If the delay between star formation and SNIa activity
exceeds 1 Gy substantially, and/or the peak of the cosmic star formation rate
occurs at a redshift much larger than unity, the gamma-ray production of SNIa
would be insufficient to explain the observed CGB. Alternatively, the cosmic
star formation rate would have to be higher (by a factor 2-3) than commonly
assumed, which is in accord with several upward revisions reported in the

estimate for the first time the evolution of the correlation function and bias

correlation function of galaxy-size halos xi_hh is well approximated by a
power-law with slope ~1.6-1.8. The difference between the shape of xi_hh and
the shape of the correlation function of matter results in the scale-dependent
bias at scales <7/h Mpc, which we find to be a generic prediction of the
hierarchical models. The bias evolves rapidly from a high value of ~2-5 at
z~3-7 to the anti-bias of b~0.5-1 at small <5/h Mpc scales at z=0. We find that
our results agree well with existing clustering data at different redshifts.
Particularly, we find an excellent agreement in both slope and the amplitude
between xi_hh(z=0) in our LCDM simulation and the galaxy correlation function

patterns of C, Mg, Si, Ca, and H seen in extremely metal-deficient stars with

remnants (SNRs). This suggests that most of the stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5 were
made from individual supernova (SN) events. To obtain the ratio of heavy
elements to hydrogen, a formula is derived to estimate the mass of hydrogen
swept up by a SNR when it occurs in the interstellar matter with the primordial
abundances. We use [Mg/H] to indicate the metallicities instead of [Fe/H]. The
metallicities [Mg/H] predicted from these SNRs range from ~-4 to ~-1.5 and the
mass of Mg in a SN is well correlated with its progenitor's mass. Thus the
observed [Mg/H] in an extremely metal deficient star has a correspondence to
the progenitor's mass. A larger [Mg/H] corresponds to a larger progenitor's
mass. Therefore, so called `age-metallicity relation' does not hold for stars
with [Fe/H] < -2.5. In contrast, the [Mg/Fe] ratios in the theoretical SNRs
have a different trend from those in extremely metal-deficient stars. It is
also shown that the observed trend of [Mg/Fe] can predict the Fe yield of each
SN given the correspondence of [Mg/H] to the progenitor's mass. The Fe yields
thus obtained are consistent with those derived from SN light curve analyses.
This indicates that there is still a problem in modelling a core-collapse
supernova at its beginning of explosion or mass cut.

understanding the large-scale structure of the universe. In general, the
biasing of galaxy formation could be stochastic. Furthermore, the future galaxy
survey might allow us to explore the time evolution of the galaxy distribution.
In this paper, the analytic study of the galaxy-mass density relation and its
time evolution is presented within the framework of the stochastic biasing. In
the weakly non-linear regime, we derive a general formula for the galaxy-mass
density relation as a conditional mean using the Edgeworth expansion. The
resulting expression contains the joint moments of the total mass and galaxy
distributions. Using the perturbation theory, we investigate the time evolution
of the joint moments and examine the influence of the initial stochasticity on
the galaxy-mass density relation. The analysis shows that the galaxy-mass
density relation could be well-approximated by the linear relation. Compared
with the skewness of the galaxy distribution, we find that the estimation of
the higher order moments using the conditional mean could be affected by the
stochasticity. Therefore, the galaxy-mass density relation as a conditional
mean should be used with a caution as a tool for estimating the skewness and
the kurtosis.

ubiquitous cluster luminosity function. The DGR shows a smaller variation from
cluster to cluster in the inner regions (r \ls 0.56 Mpc). Outside these regions
we find the DGR to be strongly anti-correlated with the mean local projected
galaxy density with the DGR increasing towards lower densities. In addition the
DGR in the outer regions shows some correlation with Bautz-Morgan type. Radial
analysis of the clusters indicate that the dwarf galaxies are less centrally
clustered than the giants and form a significant halo around clusters. We
conclude that measurements of the total cluster luminosity distribution based
on the inner core alone are likely to be severe underestimates of the dwarf
component, the integrated cluster luminosity and the contribution of galaxy
masses to the cluster's total mass. Further work is required to quantify this.
The observational evidence that the unrelaxed, lower density outer regions of

that the field is a predominantly dwarf rich environment and that the dwarf
galaxies are under-represented in measures of the local field luminosity
function.

values determine to a great extent the resulting eigenstates and corresponding
spectral weights. Details of the state correlations strongly suppress most of
the possible conduction channels, giving rise to effective selection rules for
conductance through the molecule. Most states are found to make insignificant
contributions to the total current for finite biases. We find also that the
symmetry of the structure is reflected in the I-V characteristics, and is in
qualitative agreement with experiment.

theories with large extra spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we explore the
role of such extra dimensions for cosmology, focusing on cosmological phase
transitions in field theory and the Hagedorn transition and radius
stabilization in string theory. In each case, we find that significant
distinctions emerge from the usual case in which such large extra dimensions
are absent. For example, for temperatures larger than the scale of the
compactification radii, we show that the critical temperature above which
symmetry restoration occurs is reduced relative to the usual four-dimensional
case, and consequently cosmological phase transitions in extra dimensions are
delayed. Furthermore, we argue that if phase transitions do occur at
temperatures larger than the compactification scale, then they cannot be of
first-order type. Extending our analysis to string theories with large internal
dimensions, we focus on the Hagedorn transition and the new features that arise
due to the presence of large internal dimensions. We also consider the role of
thermal effects in establishing a potential for the radius of the compactified
dimension, and we use this to propose a thermal mechanism for generating and
stabilizing a large radius of compactification.

find that a slight modification of the IIB superalgebra is needed to describe

magnetic polarizabilities is expressed analytically through their static
values, which are known from experiment. The numerical value of the correction
to the hydrogen 1S state is $ - 71 \pm 11 \pm 7$ Hz. Correction to the H-D
1S-2S -- isotope shift due to the proton and neutron polarizabilities is
estimated as $ 53 \pm 9 \pm 11$ Hz.

features a possible solution to the so-called gating current paradox, namely
that the bell-shaped curve that describes the voltage dependence of the
kinetics is broader than expected from, and shifted relative to, the sigmoidal
curve that describes the voltage dependence of the activation. The model also
predicts some temperature dependence of this shift, but presence of the latter
has not been tested experimentally so far.
