average 35-day cycle lightcurve for Her X-1. 35-day lightcurve features such as
eclipses and absorption dips, and the alternating occurrence of the Main High
and Short High states, are well measured. The occurrence of X-ray eclipse
during the Low state is confirmed as is the presence of Main High states that
``turn-on'' sharply at orbital phases 0.23 and 0.68. The Main High state covers
35-day phase 0-0.31 and the Short High state covers phase 0.57-0.79, with phase
0 defined by Main High state turn-on. We find extended ingresses and egresses
for the Short High state. Marching pre-eclipse absorption dips progressively
become shallower during the Main High state. The marching pre-eclipse dip
period is best determined from reanalysis of archival data as 1.651 +/- .002
days if the dip marching can be extrapolated from the Main High state into the
Short High state or 1.646 +/- .003 using dips within single Main High states

July 1996. In June 1997, the polarisation degree had decreased to 6.5 % with a
less good alignment. On the other hand, the total 170 micron flux is the same
for both epochs. Our measurements provide additional constraints for the
multi-wavelength properties of synchrotron emission in radio jets and the
temporal evolution of these properties: they show that the FIR radiation of 3C
279 is optically thin and that its origin is very close to the core. The
variability of the FIR polarisation without any change of the total FIR flux
can be explained by a disordering of the magnetic field in between the core and

nebula surrounding SN1987A and the properties of its progenitor star. A Wind
Blwon Bubble (WBB) scenario is emplyed, in which a fast, tenuous wind from a
Blue Supergiant expands into a slow, dense wind, expelled during an earlier Red
Supergiant phase. The bipolar shapre develops due to a pole-to-equator density
contrast in the slow wind (ie, the slow wind forms a slow torus). We use the
Wind Compressed Disk (WCD) model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli (1992) to determine
the shape of the slow torus. In the WCD scenario, the shape of the torus is
determined by the rotation of the progenitor star. We then use a self-similar
semi-analytical method for wind blown bubble evolution to determine the shape
of the resulting bipolar nebula.
  We find that the union of the wind-compressed-disk and bipolar-wind-blown-
bubble models allows us to recover the salient properties of SN1987A's
circumstellar nebula. In particular, the size, speed and density of SN1987A's
inner ring are easily reproduced in our calculations. An exploration of
parameter space shows the the red supergiant progenitor must be been rotating
at > 0.3 of its breakup speed. We conclude that the progenitor was most likely
spun up by a merger with a binary companion. Using a simple model for the
binary merger we find that the companion is likely to have had a mass > 0.5

will occur. As the burst evolves, the surrounding material is photoionized,
leading to fluorescence line emission and reduced photoelectric absorption
opacity. We have analyzed this process in detail, accounting for the
time-dependent photoelectric absorption, photoionization and fluorescence line
emission from the CBM. We find that even if GRBs are hosted in dense
star-forming regions, photoionization of the GRB environment leads to a
constant, but very weak level of delayed fluorescence line emission on
timescales of weeks to years after the burst. A temporally evolving iron~K edge
absorption feature can serve as diagnostic tool to reveal the density structure
of the CBM and may provide an opportunity for redshift measurements. We also
investigated whether photoelectric absorption could be responsible for the
spectral evolution of the low-energy slopes of some bright BATSE $\gamma$-ray
bursts displaying extremely hard spectra below the peak energy, inconsistent
with the optically-thin synchrotron shock model. We find that a very strong
metal enrichment (~ 100 times solar-system abundances) in the gamma-ray burst
environment and a rather peculiar spatial distribution of the CBM would be
necessary in order to account for the observed hard spectra below a few 100 keV
and their temporal evolution.

to be used in a wide range of situations. Software engineers, in particular,
are trained to seek general solutions to problems. General solutions can be
used not only to address the problem at hand, but also to address a wide range
of problems that the designers may not have even anticipated. Sometimes
designers wish to provide general solutions, while encouraging certain uses of
their technology and discouraging or precluding others. They may attempt to
influence the use of technology by ``hard-wiring'' it so that it only can be
used in certain ways, licensing it so that those who use it are legally
obligated to use it in certain ways, issuing guidelines for how it should be
used, or providing resources that make it easier to use the technology as the
designers intended than to use it in any other way.
  This paper examines several cases where designers have attempted to influence
the use of technology through one of these mechanisms. Such cases include key
recovery encryption, Pegasus Mail, Platform for Internet Content Selection
(PICS) Guidelines, Java, Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)
Implementation Guide, Apple's style guidelines, and Microsoft Foundation
Classes. In some of these cases, the designers sought to influence the use of
technology for competitive reasons or in order to promote standardization or
interoperability. However, in other cases designers were motivated by
policy-related goals such as protecting privacy or free speech. As new
technologies are introduced with the express purpose of advancing
policy-related goals (for example, PICS and P3P), it is especially important to
understand the roles designers might play in influencing the use of technology.

x 8 lattice simulation was done for quenched $\beta=3,4,5$ and unquenched
$\beta=4, \kappa=0.1,0.15,0.2$ using each 100 independent samples. The Landau
gauge fixing was done by an extension of the Fourier acceleration method with
the condition Max|div A|<10^{-4}, and the field A is related to the link
variable by U=exp A instead of the usual U-linear definition. We confirmed
gauge fixing with smearing preconditioning works perfectly for the purpose of
finding the global minimum of the squared norm of the gauge field when $\beta$
is large(e.g. $\beta=5$). Our simulation results suggests the possibility of a
realization of the infrared behaviour of the Gribov-Zwanziger theory.
