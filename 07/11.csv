sub-population of WIMPs captured by scattering in surface layers of the Sun to
evolve to have orbits which no longer intersect the Sun. We argue that such
WIMPs, if their orbit has a semi-major axis less than 1/2 of Jupiter's, can
persist in the solar system for cosmological timescales. This leads to a new,
previously unanticipated WIMP population intersecting the Earth's orbit. The
WIMP-nucleon cross sections required for this population to be significant are
precisely those in the range predicted for SUSY dark matter, lying near the
present limits obtained by direct underground dark matter searches using
cyrogenic detectors. Thus, if a WIMP signal is observed in the next generation
of detectors, a potentially measurable signal due to this new population must
exist. This signal, lying in the keV range for Germanium detectors, would be
complementary to that of galactic halo WIMPs. A comparison of event rates,
anisotropies, and annual modulations would not only yield additional
confirmation that any claimed signal is indeed WIMP-based, but would also allow
one to gain information on the nature of the underlying dark matter model.

anisotropies will provide accurate determinations of many fundamental
cosmological parameters. In this paper, we analyse degeneracies among
cosmological parameters to illustrate some of the limitations inherent in CMB
parameter estimation. For simplicity, throughout our analysis we assume a cold
dark matter universe with power-law adiabatic scalar and tensor fluctuation
spectra. We show that most of the variance in cosmological parameter estimates
is contributed by a small number (two or three) principal components. An exact
likelihood analysis shows that the usual Fisher matrix approach can
significantly overestimate the errors on cosmological parameters. We show that
small correlated errors in estimates of the CMB power spectrum at levels well
below the cosmic variance limits, (caused, for example, by Galactic foregrounds
or scanning errors) can lead to significant biases in cosmological parameters.
Estimates of cosmological parameters can be improved very significantly by
applying theoretical restrictions to the tensor component and external
constraints derived from more conventional astronomical observations such as
measurements of he Hubble constant, Type 1a supernovae distances and
observations of galaxy clustering and peculiar velocities.

amplitudes of about 0.02 magnitudes. The sdB star contributes nearly all of the

unseen companion star is small (i.e. R_comp ~ 0.01 solar radii) and therefore
degenerate. We modeled the U and B light curves and derived i = 78.05 +/- 0.50
degrees and a mass ratio of q = M_comp/M_sdB = 0.87 +/- 0.15. The sdB star
fills 69% of its Roche lobe. These quantities may be combined with the mass
function of the companion (f(M) = 0.126 +/- 0.028 solar masses) to derive M_sdB

II bursts, which occur in a variety of patterns. The light curves of

core-collapse of very massive stars in star-forming regions in the starburst
galaxies at high redshift. The bimodial structure of the gamma-ray bursts point
to their association with the two redshift peaks observed in the recent study
of high-redshift galaxies; one of these regions involves massive star-forming
galaxies of normal type at z~3, the other is related to the star formation in
dwarf galaxies around z ~1. The cosmological time-dilation observed in GRBs is
consistent with this picture and the time-dilation observed in high-redshift
Type I supernovae. The details of the GRB characteristics, the nature of the
starburst galaxies, and a failed-TypeI supernova/hypernova model of GRBs are
discussed in several papers. In this paper II we discuss the details of
star-formation in starburst galaxies both in the local universe and at high
redshift, and we study the association of these star-forming regions with GRBs.
The details of the failed-supernova/hypernova model of GRBs will be discussed
in the next article (paper III). According to this model, the collapse of a
massive star produces a dense torus of circumstellar material as well as a
relativistic shock-wave accompanied by ejecta, which generate shells by impact
with the material around the collapsed core, which in turn cause high-energy
gamma-ray emission and the observed afterglow.

one-dimensional periodic array of scatterers in which point particles move from
cell to cell as defined by a piecewise linear map. The microscopic chaotic
scattering process of the map can be changed by a control parameter. This
induces a parameter dependence for the macroscopic diffusion coefficient. We
calculate the diffusion coefficent and the largest eigenmodes of the system by
using Markov partitions and by solving the eigenvalue problems of respective
topological transition matrices. For different boundary conditions we find that
the largest eigenmodes of the map match to the ones of the simple
phenomenological diffusion equation. Our main result is that the difffusion
coefficient exhibits a fractal structure by varying the system parameter. To
understand the origin of this fractal structure, we give qualitative and
quantitative arguments. These arguments relate the sequence of oscillations in
the strength of the parameter-dependent diffusion coefficient to the
microscopic coupling of the single scatterers which changes by varying the
control parameter.

applying the Maxwell construction to the dependence of the low-temperature

disruption of the superfluid phase is caused by the growth of the commensurate
phase. We further observe that the superfluid phase has a transition
temperature consistent with the two-dimensional value. Promotion to the third

the residual gauge degrees of freedom. Within the random-variable approximation
for the off-diagonal angle variable, we prove that off-diagonal gluon

show exact abelian dominance for the string tension, although small deviation

created after inflation in the process of reheating due to their interaction
with the oscillating inflaton field. In the bosonic sector, the leading channel
of particle production is the non-perturbative regime of parametric resonance,
preheating, during which bosons are created exponentially fast. Pauli blocking
prohibits the unbounded creation of fermions. For this reason, it has been
silently assumed that the creation of fermions can be treated with perturbation
theory for the decay of individual inflatons. We consider the production of
fermions interacting with the coherently oscillating inflatons. We find that
the actual particle production occurs in a regime of the parametric excitation
of fermions, leading to preheating of fermions. Fermion preheating differs
significantly from the perturbative expectation. It turns out that the number
density of fermions varies periodically with time. The total number of fermions
quickly saturates to an average value within a broad range of momenta $\propto
q^{1/4}$, where $q$ is the usual resonance parameter. The resonant excitation
of fermions may affect the transfer inflaton energy, estimations of the
reheating temperature, and the abundance of superheavy fermions and gravitinos.
Back in the bosonic sector, outside of the parametric resonance bands there is
an additional effect of parametric excitation of bosons with bounded occupation
number in the momentum range $\propto q^{1/4}$.

(x,y)f(t) = e^{2 pi i yt}f(t+x) and if L is a subset of R^2, define S(f,L) =
{(x,y)f | (x,y) in L}. It has been conjectured that if f is not 0, then S(f,L)
is linearly independent over C; one motivation for this problem comes from
Gabor analysis. We shall prove that S(f,L) is linearly independent if f is
nonzero and L is contained in a discrete subgroup of R^2, and as a byproduct we
shall obtain some results on the group von Neumann algebra generated by the
operators {(x,y) | (x,y) in L}. Also we shall prove these results for the
obvious generalization to R^n.

ion collisions at $11.6~{\rm A\cdot GeV}/c$ beam momentum within a hadronic
framework. This ratio is enhanced relative to corresponding ratios in $pp$
collisions, and is large when compared with thermal fits to heavy ion data.
Using a detailed cascade calculation, we show that different annihilation
cross--sections of $\bar \Lambda$'s and $\bar p$'s, and the net conversion of
$\bar p$'s to $\bar \Lambda$'s, do not account for the enhancement in central
collisions. For larger impact parameters, however, hadronic mechanisms may well
suffice to produce the observed enhancement. Uncertainties in elementary
cross--sections and formation times are considered.

induced kaon fields of the chiral soliton and the non-monotoneous dependence on
symmetry breaking of the nucleon matrix element of the flavor singlet piece of
the operator associated with these induced fields. Both features are sensitive
to four quark operators including an $\bar s s$ pair.

explores the possibility of extending this general viewpoint to finding hidden
subgroups of noncommutative groups. We present a quantum algorithm for the
special case of dihedral groups which determines the hidden subgroup in a
linear number of calls to the input function. We also explore the difficulties
of developing an algorithm to process the data to explicitly calculate a
generating set for the subgroup. A general framework for the noncommutative
hidden subgroup problem is discussed and we indicate future research
directions.
