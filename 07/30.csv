can be estimated from its lens magnification. The magnification can be
determined from the variation in number counts of its background galaxies. In
the weak lensing approximation the surface mass density is a linear function of
the magnification. However, most observational data is concentrated in the
central parts of clusters, so one needs to go beyond the weak lensing
approximation, and consider the lens shear as well, which is unknown from the
variation in number counts alone. We studied the lensing properties of a
catalogue of numerical cluster models in order to find the best possible
approximation for the shear which still allows straightforward determination of
the surface mass density. We show that by using such an approximation one can
fairly well reconstruct the surface mass distribution from the magnification
alone. It is demonstrated that the mass estimated using the weak lens
magnification approximation is usually at least twice the true mass. We
illustrate our technique on existing data, and show that the resulting masses
compare well to other estimates.

X-ray emissivity of 3.0 +- 0.3 x 10**39 (20 Mpc/R) erg/s/Mpc**3 where R is the
radius of the supercluster and the error is photon counting noise only. If one
considers fluctuations in the X-ray background as an additional component of

is consistent with fits of the model to data sets obtained by rotating the
original data. The distribution of these rotated fits indicates that the

radiation (CMBR) on 7-22 arcminute scales. Observations of 36 fields near the
North Celestial Pole (NCP) were made at 31.7 and 14.5 GHz, using the 5.5-meter
and 40-meter telescopes at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) from 1993
to 1996.
  Multi-epoch VLA observations at 8.5 and 15 GHz allow removal of discrete
source contamination. After point-source subtraction, we detect significant
structure, which we identify with emission from a combination of a
steep-spectrum foreground and the CMBR. The foreground component is found to
correlate with IRAS 100 micron dust emission. Lack of H-alpha emission near the
NCP suggests that this foreground is either high-temperature thermal
bremsstrahlung (T_e ~ 10^6 K), flat-spectrum synchrotron or an exotic component
of dust emission. On the basis of low-frequency maps of the NCP, we can
restrict the spectral index of the foreground to beta >= -2.2.
  Although the foreground signal dominates at 14.5 GHz, the extracted CMBR
component contributes 88\% of the variance at 31.7 GHz, yielding an rms
fluctuation amplitude of 82^{+12.1}_{-9.1} microKelvin, including 4.3%
calibration uncertainty and 12% sample variance (68% confidence). The
equivalent broadband amplitude is dT_{l_e} = 59^{+8.6}_{-6.5} microKelvin at
l_e = 589. This measurement, when combined with small angular-scale upper
limits obtained at the OVRO, indicates that the CMBR angular power spectrum
decreases between l ~ 600 and l ~ 2000 and is consistent with flat cosmological
models.

distribution peaks at different energies. This leads to a trend in the observed
properties: an increase of the observed power corresponds to: 1) a decrease in
the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks; 2) an increase in
the ratio of the powers of the high and low energy spectral components. Objects
along this sequence would be observationally classified respectively as high
frequency BL Lac objects, low frequency BL Lac objects, highly polarized
quasars and lowly polarized quasars. The proposed scheme is based on the
correlations among the physical parameters derived in the present paper by
applying to 51 gamma ray loud blazars two of the most accepted scenarios for
the broad band emission of blazars, namely the synchrotron self--Compton and
external Compton models, and explains the observational trends presented by

structural properties motivated by current theories of cold dark matter (CDM)

the formation of prominent tidal tails can be strongly suppressed by massive
and extended dark haloes. For the large halo-to-disk mass ratio expected in CDM
cosmologies their sequence of models failed to produce strong tails like those
observed in many well-known pairs of interacting galaxies. In order to test
whether this effect can constrain the viability of CDM cosmologies, we
construct N-body models of disk galaxies with structural properties derived in
analogy to the analytical work of Mo, Mao & White (1998). With a series of
self-consistent collisionless simulations of galaxy-galaxy mergers we
demonstrate that even the disks of very massive dark haloes have no problems
developing long tidal tails, provided the halo spin parameter is large enough.
We show that the halo-to-disk mass ratio is a poor indicator for the ability to
produce tails. Instead, the relative size of disk and halo, or alternatively,
the ratio of circular velocity to local escape speed at the half mass radius of
the disk are more useful criteria. This result holds in all CDM cosmologies.
The length of tidal tails is thus unlikely to provide useful constraints on
such models.

superconductor-insulator-normal metal (SIN) tunnel junctions are formed between

features including sharp conductance peaks. Reproducible superconductor-
insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunnel junctions are also obtained between two
pieces of the Bi-2212 crystals, resulting in simultaneous quasiparticle and
Josephson currents. Superconducting gap values are obtained from the SIS data
using a model with d-wave symmetry. The SIS tunneling conductances also show
very pronounced symmetric dips and humps at high bias voltages. The high bias
conductance data reveal that the dip and hump features are part of a larger
spectrum that extends out to 300-400 mV. The dynamic conductances of both SIN
and SIS junctions are qualitatively similar to those found on optimally-doped
Bi-2212 but with reduced gap values ($\Delta$=15-20 meV). The maximum Josephson
current depends on junction resistance in a manner consistent with
Ambegaokar-Baratoff theory but with a reduced $I_{c}R_{n}$ product of $\sim$2.4
mV.

negative scattering length confined in a harmonic trap. When a realistic non
local (finite range) effective interaction is taken into account, we find that,
besides the known low density metastable solution, a new branch of Bose
condensate appears at higher density. This state is self-bound but its density
can be quite low if the number $N$ of atoms is not too big. The transition
between the two classes of solutions as a function of $N$ can be either sharp
or smooth according to the ratio between the range of the attractive
interaction and the length of the trap. A tight trap leads to a smooth
transition. In addition to the energy and the shape of the cloud we study also
the dynamics of the system. In particular, we study the frequencies of
collective oscillation of the Bose condensate as a function of the number of
atoms both in the local and in the non local case. Moreover, we consider the

a wake of shaking fragments. As long as the resulting high-frequency acoustic
waves remain of sufficient amplitude to lead to a fluidization of the fault
core, the fault is unlocked and free to slip under the effect of the tectonic

most promising, from our point of view, model describing HERA anomaly. We
update our previous analysis and take into account new HERA statistics of the

a specific scenario with several non-zero couplings. R-parity broken SUSY with
several non-zero couplings could explain both high $Q^2 e^+ + jets$ and $\mu^+

excess of high $Q^2$ di- or tri-jet events at HERA. The relation of this

and rectilinearly moving relative to each other, can be adjusted via (possibly
anisotropic) rescaling and re-synchronization so that the resulting pair of RFs
is Lorentzian; this statement remains true if the word ""Lorentzian"" is replaced
by ""Galilean"" or ""Riemannian"", i.e., if a finite positive value of $c^2$ is
replaced by $\infty$ or by a negative real number. In this particular sense,
the Lorentzian, as well as Galilean or Riemannian, phenomenon turns out to be
merely a matter of an arbitrary choice of appropriate rescaling and
re-synchronization of any given pair of RFs. Generalizations and refinements of
this result are obtained, including universal generalized Lorentzian adjustment
via rescaling and re-synchronization of arbitrarily large families of RFs.
Alternatively, the generalized Lorentzian property of a pair of RFs is shown to
be a consequence of reciprocity and isotropy, with no adjustment needed in this
case. The universality of light and of the corresponding Lorentzian property of
the spacetime is questioned. Waves of transformation of spacetime are
introduced, which have in a certain sense a more universal character than
electromagnetic or gravitational waves.

generalized by grouping coupling terms between the field and the Ricci

one sees that a common misunderstanding resulting from such an identification
leads one, in the case of the spin 2 field, to regard the cosmological constant
as a non-vanishing mass of cosmological origin for the graviton. Similarly,
there are inconsistencies for the spin 1 field. Instead, the intrinsic mass of
a field should be regarded as being independent of the background curvature.

viable alternative to the plane-wave method to analyze the spectrum of
electromagnetic waves in a three-dimensional periodic dielectric lattice.
Firstly, in the case of an fcc lattice of homogeneous dielectric spheres, we
reproduce the main features of the spectrum obtained by the plane wave method,
namely that for a sufficiently high dielectric contrast a full gap opens in the
spectrum between the eights and ninth bands if the dielectric constant
$\epsilon_s$ of spheres is lower than the dielectric constant $\epsilon_b$ of
the background medium. If $\epsilon_s> \epsilon_b$, no gap is found in the
spectrum. The maximal value of the relative band-gap width approaches 14% in
the close-packed case and decreases monotonically as the filling fraction
decreases. The lowest dielectric contrast $\epsilon_b/\epsilon_s$ for which a
full gap opens in the spectrum is determined to be 8.13. Eventually, in the
case of an fcc lattice of coated spheres, we demonstrate that a suitable
coating can enhance gap widths by as much as 50%.
