(iii) numerical viscosity, and (iv) angular momentum transport. The results are
useful for quantifying the accuracy of the SPH scheme, especially for problems
where shear flows or shocks are present, as well as for problems where true
hydrodynamic mixing is relevant.
  We examine the different forms of artificial viscosity (AV) which have been
proposed by Monaghan, by Hernquist & Katz, and by Balsara. For each form, our
tests suggest a single set of values for the AV parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$
(coefficients of the linear and quadratic terms) which are appropriate in a
large number of situations. We also discuss how these parameters should be
adjusted depending on the goals of the particular application. We find that
both the Hernquist & Katz and Balsara forms introduce relatively small amounts
of numerical viscosity. Furthermore, both Monaghan's and Balsara's AV do well
at treating shocks and at limiting the amount of spurious mixing. For these
reasons, we endorse the Balsara AV for use in a broad range of applications.

Galactic extinction from field galaxy number-counts and colors. The method
comprises simulating extinction in suitable reference fields by changing the
isophotal detection limit. This procedure takes into account selection effects,
in particular, the change in isophotal detection limit (and hence in isophotal
magnitude completeness limit) with extinction, and the galaxy color--magnitude
relation.
  We present a first application of the method to the HST WFPC2 images of the
gamma-ray burster GRB 970228. Four different WFPC2 high-latitude fields,
including the HDF, are used as reference to measure the average extinction
towards the GRB in the F606W passband. From the counts, we derive an average
extinction of A_V = 0.5 mag, but the dispersion of 0.4 mag between the
estimates from the different reference fields is significantly larger than can
be accounted by Poisson plus clustering uncertainties. Although the counts
differ, the average colors of the field galaxies agree well. The extinction
implied by the average color difference between the GRB field and the reference
galaxies is A_V = 0.6 mag, with a dispersion in the estimated extinction from
the four reference fields of only 0.1 mag. All our estimates are in good
agreement with the value of 0.81\pm0.27 mag obtained by Burstein & Heiles, and
with the extinction of 0.78\pm0.12 measured by Schlegel et al. from maps of

burst GRB 970228, made with the Hubble Space Telescope STIS CCD approximately
six months after outburst and with the HST/NICMOS and Keck/NIRC approximately
one year after outburst. The unresolved counterpart is detected by STIS at
V=28.0 +/- 0.25, consistent with a continued power-law decline with exponent
-1.14 +/- 0.05. The counterpart is located within, but near the edge of, a
faint extended source with diameter ~0.""8 and integrated magnitude V=25.8 +/-
0.25. A reanalysis of HST and NTT observations performed shortly after the
burst shows no evidence of proper motion of the point source or fading of the
extended emission. Only the extended source is visible in the NICMOS images
with a magnitude of H=23.3 +/- 0.1. The Keck observations find K = 22.8 +/-
0.3. Several distinct and independent means of deriving the foreground
extinction in the direction of GRB 970228 all agree with A_V = 0.75 +/- 0.2.
After adjusting for Galactic extinction, we find that the size of the observed
extended emission is consistent with that of galaxies of comparable magnitude
found in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) and other deep HST images. Only 2% of the
sky is covered by galaxies of similar or greater surface brightness; therefore
the extended source is almost certainly the host galaxy. Additionally, we find
that the extinction-corrected V - H and V - K colors of the host are as blue as
any galaxy of comparable or brighter magnitude in the HDF. Taken in concert
with recent observations of GRB 970508, GRB 971214, and GRB 980703 our work
suggests that all four GRBs with spectroscopic identification or deep
multicolor broad-band imaging of the host lie in rapidly star-forming galaxies.

of the central velocity dispersion and systemic velocity of Leo I of 8.8 +- 1.3
km/s, and 287.0 +- 1.9 km/s, respectively. The systemic velocity confirms past
results that Leo I has an unusually large galactocentric velocity, implying the
presence of a massive dark halo in the Milky Way or an extended dark component
pervading the Local Group. The V-band (M/L) ratio of Leo I is in the range
3.5-5.6. We have produced a set of models that account for the effects of
stellar evolution on the global mass-to-light ratio of a composite population.
Because Leo I contains a dominant intermediate-age population, we find that the
V-band mass-to-light ratio of Leo I would be in the range 6-13 if it were
composed exclusively of old stars such as found in globular clusters. This
suggests that Leo I probably does contain a significant dark halo. The mass of
this halo is approximately 2 x10^7 solar masses, similar to the dark halo
masses inferred for all other Galactic dSph galaxies.
  Because Leo I is isolated and has passed the Milky Way at most once in the
past, external tides could not plausibly have inflated its centraldispersion to
the observed value. We also considered whether MOdified Newtonian Dynamics
(MOND) could account for the internal kinematics of Leo I and conclude that
this alternative gravitational model can account for the Leo I kinematics
adequately without requiring a dark halo.

based on inverse-Compton scattering as the dominant gamma-ray production

and on the unification scheme of radio-loud AGN. Depending on the evolutionary
behaviour of radio-loud AGN, our estimate for the point source contribution to
the extragalactic background emission ranges from about ~20%-40% for a redshift
drop off at Z_{max}=3 to around ~35%-85% for a cutoff at Z_{max}=5. Roughly
70%-90% of the AGN contribution to the EGRB would be due to BL~Lacs/FR I
objects. However, in case of BL Lacs our model parameters are not entirely in
agreement with the results from studies at radio wavelengths indicating
systematical uncertainties whereas our estimate for the FSRQ contribution seems
to be consistent. Thus we end up with two possibilities depending on whether we
underpredict or overpredict the BL Lac contribution: either unresolved AGN can
not account for the entire EGRB or unresolved BL Lacs produce the observed
background.

spectral index of 1.75 and a moderately-strong Compton reflection component
with a fluorescent Fe K alpha line. The OSSE data require a sharp high-energy
cutoff in the power-law spectrum. The broad-band spectra are very well modelled
by repeated Compton scattering in a thermal plasma with tau=1 and kT=50 keV. We
also find the distance to the system to be > 3 kpc, ruling out earlier
determinations of 1.3 kpc. Using this limit, the observed reddening and the
orbital period, we find the allowed range of the mass of the primary is
consistent with it being a black hole. The data are inconsistent with models of
either homogenous or patchy coronae above the surface of an accretion disc.
Rather, they are consistent with the presence of a hot inner hot disc accreting
at a rate close to the maximum set by advection and surrounded by a cold outer
disc. The seed photons for Comptonization are supplied by the outer cold disc
and/or cold clouds within the hot disc. Pair production is negligible if
electrons are thermal. The hot disc model, which scaled parameters are
independent of the black-hole mass, is supported by the similarity of the
spectrum of GX 339-4 to those of other black-hole binaries and Seyfert 1s. On
the other hand, their spectra in the soft gamma-ray regime are significantly
harder than those of weakly-magnetized neutron stars. Based on this difference,
we propose that the presence of broad-band spectra corresponding to thermal
Comptonization with kT of 50 keV or more represents a black-hole signature.

astrometric data of the basic fundamental stars, obtained over more than two
centuries and summarized in the FK5, with the observations of the HIPPARCOS
astrometry satellite. This combination provides the most accurate proper
motions available at present. There are two main reasons why the ground-based
observations are able to improve the HIPPARCOS proper motions considerably: (1)
The lower positional accuracy of the ground-based observations is compensated
by a much longer period of observations, covering more than 200 years for most
FK6 stars; (2) Due to undetected astrometric binaries, the HIPPARCOS proper
motions, measured 'instantaneously' during a period of about 3 years only, can
deviate significantly from the long-term proper motions, while the ground-based
results of the FK5 provide already fairly 'time- averaged' data. Hence the
ground-based results allow to identify and to correct, at least partially,
'cosmic errors' in the HIPPARCOS proper motions. The proper motions of the FK6,
and hence the positions predicted from the FK6 data, are significantly more
accurate than the data given in the HIPPARCOS Catalogue and in the FK5. For
truly single stars, the accuracy is improved by a factor of about 2 by the FK6.
For the ensemble of apparently single stars, in which the HIPPARCOS proper
motions suffer from cosmic errors due to undetected astrometric binaries, the
gain is even higher, by a factor of more than 4. Double stars pose special
problems which are handled rather individually in the FK6. Among all the FK6
stars, a subset of 'astrometrically excellent stars' is identified for
high-precision astrometry, avoiding as far as possible a disturbing binary
nature of the objects.

clearly extended and nonthermal (synchrotron) in nature. Positionally, the B[e]
star is found to coincide with the more compact radio source, while the
southerly lobe of the extended source is coincident with Ara A, an M2 I star.
Observation of the region at 10micron reveals strong emission with an almost
identical spatial distribution to the radio emission. Ara C is found to have an
extreme radio luminosity in comparison to prior radio observations of hot stars
such as O and B supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, given the estimated distance
to the cluster. An origin in a detatched shell of material around the central
star is therefore suggested; however given the spatial extent of the emission,
such a shell must be relatively young (10^3 yrs). The extended non thermal
emission associated with the M star Ara A is unexpected; to the best of our
knowledge this is a unique phenomenon. SAX (2-10keV) observations show no
evidence of X-ray emission, which might be expected if a compact companion were
present.

this work we present a new rescaling method, which gives a significantly better

of the homogeneous evolution in a one-dimensional coupled map lattice but
appears to be equally valid in a much wider range of cases. We evaluate the
performance of our rescaling method by comparing it to the conventional
rescaling (dividing by the relative sub-system volume) for one and
two-dimensional lattices in spatio-temporal chaotic regimes. In doing so we
notice that the Lyapunov spectra for consecutive sub-system sizes are
interleaved and we discuss the possible ways in which this may arise. Finally,
we use the new rescaling to approximate quantities derived from the Lyapunov
spectrum (largest Lyapunov exponent, Lyapunov dimension and Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy) finding better convergence as the sub-system size is increased than
with conventional rescaling.

into an asymptotic shape characterized by a discontinuity at a value $x_c=0.5$,

observation of a pseudogap, e.g. in ARPES experiments, is a familiar example of
this physics. One potential explanation for this behaviour involves preformed
pairs with finite lifetimes existing in the normal state above T$_c$. In this
way two characteristic temperatures can be established. A higher one T$^*$ at
which pairs begin to form and the actual T$_c$ at which a phase-coherent
superconducting phase is established.

model in two dimensions in the fully self-consistent ladder approximation at
low electron densities. In the non self-consistent version of this theory the
system always shows an instability towards Bose-condensation of infinite
lifetime pairs. In contrast to this, pairs obtain a finite lifetime due to
pair-pair interaction and the sharp two-particle bound state is strongly
lifetime broadened when self-consistency is applied. A quasi-particle
scattering rate which varies linearly with temperature is also found. The fully
self-consistent calculation we were able to perform using a ${\bf {\vec

an interface separating two distinct high-temperature deconfined phases splits

confined phases may coexist with a Coulomb phase at zero temperature. In that

theory invariant under non linear local or global symmetries is the proper
solution to the master equation of the extended antifield formalism. It is
shown that, from the knowledge of the BRST cohomology, it is possible to
explicitly construct a further extension of the formalism containing all the
observables of the theory and satisfying an extended master equation, with some
of the features of the quantum Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation already
present at the classical level. This solution has the remarkable property that
all its infinitesimal deformations can be extended to complete deformations.
The deformed solutions differs from the original one through the addition of
terms related to coupling constant and anticanonical field-antifield
redefinitions. As a consequence, all theories admitting an invariant
regularization scheme are shown to be renormalizable while preserving the
symmetries, in the sense that both the subtracted and the effective action
satisfy the extended master equation, and this independently of power counting
restrictions. The anomalous case is also studied and a suitable definition of
the Batalin-Vilkovisky ``Delta'' operator in the context of dimensional
renormalization is proposed.

the framework of the geometry of Clifford bundles provided with compatible
nonlinear and distinguished connections and metric structures (d-connection and
d-metric). The spinor differential geometry of ha-spaces is constructed. There
are discussed some related issues connected with the physical aspects of higher
order anisotropic interactions for gravitational, gauge, spinor, Dirac spinor
and Proca fields. Motion equations in higher order generalizations of Finsler
spaces, of the mentioned type of fields, are defined by using bundles of linear

$\tilde s$ acts as a graded derivation on the algebra of interacting fields.
Positivity, i.e. the existence of Hilbert space representations of the local
algebras of observables is shown with the help of a local Kugo-Ojima operator
$Q_{\rm int}$ which implements $\tilde s$ on a local algebra and differs from
the corresponding operator $Q$ of the free theory. We prove that the Hilbert
space structure present in the free case is stable under perturbations. All
