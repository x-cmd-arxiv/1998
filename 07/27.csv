than the average of the type, and make their CCD imaging of the R and H-alpha
bands. The equivalent widths of H-alpha emission increase with increasing
L(FIR)/L(B), indicating that L(FIR)/L(B) can be an indicator of star formation
for such early type spirals with star formation activities higher than the
average. For all of the observed early type spirals, the extended HII regions
exist at the central regions with some asymmetric features. H-alpha emission is
more concentrated to the galactic center than the R band light, and the degree
of the concentration increases with the star formation activity. We also
analyze the relation between the star formation activities and the existence of
companion galaxies in the sample galaxies and other bright early type spirals.
No correlation is found and this suggests that the interaction is not
responsible for all of the star formation activities of early type spirals.

typical velocities of Hb-emitting clouds in the Broad Line Region (BLR) and the
size of this region. However, this estimate depends on various assumptions and
is susceptible to large systematic errors. The Hb-deduced black hole mass in a
sample of 14 bright quasars is found here to correlate with the quasar host
galaxy luminosity, as determined with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This
correlation is similar to the black hole mass vs. bulge luminosity correlation
found by Magorrian et al. in a sample of 32 nearby normal galaxies. The
similarity of the two correlations is remarkable since the two samples involve
apparently different types of objects and since the black hole mass estimates
in quasars and in nearby galaxies are based on very different methods.
  This similarity provides a ``calibration'' of the Hb-deduced black hole mass
estimate, suggesting it is accurate to +-0.5 on log scale. The similarity of
the two correlations also suggests that quasars reside in otherwise normal
galaxies, and that the luminosity of quasar hosts can be estimated to +-0.5 mag
based on the quasar continuum luminosity and the Hb line width. Future imaging
observations of additional broad-line active galaxies with the HST are required
in order to explore the extent, slope, and scatter of the black hole mass vs.
host bulge luminosity correlation in active galaxies.

diffuse gamma-ray emission. The spectrum of the extragalactic gamma-ray
background above 30 MeV can be well described by a power law with photon index
s=2.1. In the 2-10 MeV range a preliminary analysis of COMPTEL data indicates a
lower intensity than previously found, with no evidence for an MeV bump. Most
of the models of a truly diffuse background seem to be in conflict with the
observed spectrum. Though AGN are the most likely input from discrete sources,
two independent attempts to model the high energy background as the
superposition of unresolved AGN indicate that AGN underproduce the observed
intensity. Therefore the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background is
still unknown. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray continuum is more intense than
expected both at very low energies (< 100 keV) and at high energies (> 1 GeV).
The published models for these excesses all involve cosmic ray electron
interactions. While the low energy excess may have something to do with in-situ
acceleration of electrons, the excess at high energies may be understood if the
sources of cosmic ray electrons are discrete. The measured energy spectrum of
the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray continuum radiation thus may provide new
insights into the acceleration of cosmic rays.

scanning observations by TGRS and SMM to produce maps of the narrow Galactic
511 keV line emission (Purcell et al. 1997). A modelling of the combined data
give evidence for three distinct features: the Galactic plane, a central bulge,
and an extended emission region at positive latitudes above the Galactic
center. It has been proposed that the high-latitude feature is associated with
a fountain of radioactive debris produced by enhanced supernova activity in the
Galactic center region (Dermer and Skibo 1997). Here we discuss this scenario
in more detail: we have build a 2-dimensional code to follow the development of
a hydrodynamical fountain in the Galactic center region. We have then
calculated the transport, cooling, and annihilation of positrons as test
particles in the outflow. As a result we find difficulties with the fountain
model if the positrons are produced by supernovae in a starburst near the
Galactic center. Annihilation on dust grains may increase the 511 keV line flux
at high latitudes. Alternatively the observed positrons may not be entirely
produced by supernovae.

through compactification of the ten dimensional $E_8\times E_8$ superstring

supplementing it with the symmetry ${\cal R}\times {\cal U}(1)$, where ${\cal
R}$ denotes a discrete `R'-symmetry. The well-known doublet-triplet splitting
problem is resolved to `all orders' via the pseudo-Goldstone mechanism, and the
GUT scale arises from an interplay of the Planck and supersymmetry breaking
scales.
  The symmetry ${\cal R}\times {\cal U}(1)$ is also important for understanding
the fermion mass hierarchies as well as the magnitudes of the CKM matrix
elements. Furthermore, the well known MSSM parameter $\tan \beta $ is estimated
to be of order unity, while the proton lifetime ($\tau_p\sim
10^2\tau_{pSU(5)}$) is consistent with observations. Depending on some
parameters, $p\to K\mu^+ $ can be the dominant decay mode.
  Finally, the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino `anomalies' require us
to introduce a `sterile' neutrino state. Remarkably, the ${\cal R}\times {\cal
U}(1)$ symmetry protects it from becoming heavy, so that maximal angle
$\nu_{\mu}$ oscillations into a sterile state can explain the atmospheric
anomaly, while the solar neutrino puzzle is resolved via the small angle
$\nu_e-\nu_{\tau}$ MSW oscillations. The existence of some ($\sim 15 - 20% $ of
critical energy density) neutrino hot dark matter is also predicted.

in this paper some tools are developed for overcoming this problem, and a
combinatorial mechanism introduced which describes sequences of elementary
moves in the graph of markings on a surface. These tools are applied to give a
family of quasi-geodesic words in the Mapping Class Group, and a linear bound
on the shortest word conjugating two conjugate pseudo-Anosov elements.

roughly analogous to closest-point projections to horoballs in classical
hyperbolic space. These projections have a strong contraction property which
makes it possible to tie together the geometry of the complex and that of the

  addresses this manuscript","Found.Phys. 29 (1999) 755-765",,"TAUP 2459-97","quant-ph",,"  Recently, several authors have criticized the time-symmetrized quantum theory
originated by the work of Aharonov et al. (1964). The core of this criticism
was a proof, appearing in various forms, which showed that the counterfactual
interpretation of time-symmetrized quantum theory cannot be reconciled with
standard quantum theory. I argue here that the apparent contradiction is due to
a logical error. I analyze the concept of counterfactuals in quantum theory and
introduce time-symmetrized counterfactuals. These counterfactuals do not lead
to any contradiction with the predictions of quantum theory. I discuss
applications of time-symmetrized counterfactuals to several surprising examples
and show the usefulness of the time-symmetrized quantum formalism.

The usefulness of the singular manifold method as a tool for determining the
non-classical symmetries that reduce the equations to ordinary differential
equations with the Painleve property is confirmed once more
