  1987A","LaTeX, 23 pages including 4 figures. To appear in ApJ (Main Journal)",,"10.1086/306654",,"astro-ph",,"  The H II region created by the progenitor of SN 1987A was further heated and
ionized by the supernova flash. Prior to the flash, the temperature of the gas
was 4000 - 5000 K, and helium was neutral, while the post-flash temperature was
only slightly less than 10^5 K, with the gas being ionized to helium-like
ionization stages of C, N and O. We have followed the slow post-flash cooling
and recombination of the gas, as well as its line emission, and find that the
strongest lines are N V 1240 and O VI 1034. Both these lines are good probes
for the density of the gas, and suitable instruments to detect the lines are
STIS on HST and FUSE, respectively. Other lines which may be detectable are N
IV] 1486 and [O III] 5007, though they are expected to be substantially weaker.
The relative strength of the oxygen lines is found to be a good tracer of the
color temperature of the supernova flash. From previous observations, we put
limits on the hydrogen density, n_H, of the H II region. The early N V 1240
flux measured by IUE gives an upper limit which is n_H ~ 180 \eta^{-0.40}
cm^{-3}, where \eta is the filling factor of the gas. The recently reported
emission in [O III] 5007 at 2500 days requires n_H = (160\pm12) \eta^{-0.19}
cm^{-3}, for a supernova burst similar to that in the 500full1 model of Ensman
& Burrows (1992). For the more energetic 500full2 burst the density is n_H =
(215\pm15) \eta^{-0.19} cm^{-3}. These values are much higher than in models of
the X-ray emission from the supernova (n_H ~ 75 cm^{-3}), and it seems
plausible that the observed [O III] emission is produced primarily elsewhere
than in the H II region. We also discuss the type of progenitor consistent with
the H II region. In particular, it seems unlikely that its spectral type was
much earlier than B2 Ia.

we show that localized plasmons are likely to exist near the constriction. We
attempt to relate these plasmons with the recent experimental observation of
deviations of the quantum point contact conductance from ideal integer

behavior, exp(-T_a/T), with a density dependent activation temperature T_a of
the order of 2 K. We suggest that T_a can be identified with the energy needed
to excite localized plasmons, and we discuss the conductance deviations in
terms of a simple theoretical model involving quasiparticle lifetime broadening
due to coupling to the localized plasmons.

functions, with theta-like behaviour, on a product of copies of its Jacobian
J(X)^r. We then parametrise the conformal blocks by their twisted correlation
functions of nilpotent currents, in the spirit of Feigin-Stoyanovsky. We
compute the action of the Sugawara tensor in terms of these correlation
functions. The result is a family of operators acting on forms on the product
J(X)^r \times \prod_{i} S^{n_i}X of the Jacobian of X with its symmetric
powers. These operators act by differentiation in the Jacobian directions, and
evaluations and residues in the variables of the symmetric powers. They serve
to express the KZB connection, which we view as a connection on the space of
curves with marked a-cycles. These operators also make sense when the level is
critical. In that case, they commute with each other. We explain their
connection with the Beilinson-Drinfeld operators. In a sequel to this paper, we
will do a similar computation in the q-deformed case, replacing the inclusion
of the enveloping algebras of the Lie algebra of regular functions on X in that
of functions on the formal disc by some inclusion of quasi-Hopf algebras, which
were introduced in work of one of us and V. Rubtsov. The outcome is a commuting
family of difference-evaluation operators, which may be viewed in the rational
