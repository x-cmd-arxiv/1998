  ApJ, in press",,,"OSU-TA-40/98","astro-ph",,"  We present photometric and spectroscopic data for the second microlensing
event seen toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), MACHO-98-SMC-1. The lens is
a binary. We resolve the caustic crossing and find that the source took 2 Delta
t = 8.5 hours to transit the caustic. We measure the source temperature
T_eff=8000 K both spectroscopically and from the color (V-I)_0~0.22. We find
two acceptable binary-lens models. In the first, the source crosses the caustic
at phi=43.2 deg and the unmagnified source magnitude is I_s=22.15. The angle
implies that the lens crosses the source radius in time t_* = Delta t sin phi =
2.92 hours. The magnitude (together with the temperature) implies that the
angular radius of the source is theta_* = 0.089 micro-arsec. Hence, the proper
motion is mu=theta_*/t_*=1.26 km/s/kpc.
  For the second solution, the corresponding parameters are phi=30.6 deg,
I_s=21.81, t_*=2.15 hours, theta_* = 0.104 micro-asrsec, mu=2.00 km/s/kpc. Both
proper-motion estimates are slower than 99.5% of the proper motions expected
for halo lenses. Both are consistent with an ordinary binary lens moving at ~
75-120 km/s within the SMC itself. We conclude that the lens is most likely in
the SMC proper.

rule out a favorite particle physics solution to this tension between He-4 and

given that the distance scale of the inhomogeneity is near the optimal value,

inhomogeneity include the QCD and electroweak phase transitions. The distance

Josephson junctions. We show that when the velocity of the moving FL exceeds
certain values $(V_{a,b})$, sharp resonances arise in the system which are
related to the excitation of the optical and acoustic collective modes. In the
interval $(V_a, V_b)$ a reconstruction of the FL occurs. We also establish that
one can excite localized nonlinear distortions (dislocations) which may
propagate through the FL and carry an arbitrary magnetic flux.

  noise","Submitted to Phys. Rev. E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.58.6828",,"cond-mat",,"  A new type of Langevin equation exhibiting a non trivial phase transition
associated with the presence of multiplicative noise is introduced. The
equation is derived as a mesoscopic representation of the microscopic annealed
Ising model (AIM) proposed by Thorpe and Beeman, and reproduces perfectly its
basic phenomenology. The AIM exhibits a non-trivial behavior as the temperature
is increased, in particular it presents a disorder-to-order phase transition at
low temperatures, and a order-to-disorder transition at higher temperatures.
This behavior resembles that of some Langevin equations with multiplicative
noise, which exhibit also two analogous phase transitions as the
noise-amplitude is increased. By comparing the standard models for
noise-induced transitions with our new Langevin equation we elucidate that the
mechanisms controlling the disorder-to-order transitions in both of them are
essentially different, even though for both of them the presence of
multiplicative noise is a key ingredient.

a systematic 1/d expansion. As a consequence, the epsilon-expansion of

us (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79} (1997) 1317; {\bf 80} (1998) 5580). It starts by
assuming that one extra parameter, the effective temperature, is needed to
describe the glassy state. This approach connects responses of macroscopic
observables to a field change with their temporal fluctuations, and with the
fluctuation-dissipation relation, in a generalized, non-equilibrium way.
Similar universal relations do not hold between energy fluctuations and the
specific heat.
  In the present paper the underlying arguments are discussed in greater
length. The main part of the paper involves details of the exact dynamical
solution of two simple models introduced recently: uncoupled harmonic
oscillators subject to parallel Monte Carlo dynamics, and independent spherical
spins in a random field with such dynamics. At low temperature the relaxation
time of both models diverges as an Arrhenius law, which causes glassy behavior
in typical situations. In the glassy regime we are able to verify the above
mentioned relations for the thermodynamics of the glassy state.
  In the course of the analysis it is argued that stretched exponential
behavior is not a fundamental property of the glassy state, though it may be
useful for fitting in a limited parameter regime.

(RH) neutrinos. This in turn reinforces the ideas of the left-right symmetric
gauge structure $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ as well as SU(4)-color, for which the
RH neutrinos are a compelling feature. It is noted that by assuming (a) that
B-L and $I_{3R}$, contained in a string-derived $G(224) = SU(2)_L \times
SU(2)_R \times SU(4)^c$ or SO(10), break near the GUT-scale, as opposed to an
intermediate scale, (b) the see-saw mechanism, and (c) the SU(4)-color relation
between the Dirac mass of the tau neutrino and $m_{top}$, one obtains a mass
for $\nu^\tau_L$ which is just about what is observed. This is assuming that
the SK group is actually seeing $\nu^\mu_L - \nu^\tau_L$ (rather than
$\nu_L^\mu - \nu_X$) oscillation. Following a very recent work by Babu, Wilczek
and myself, it is furthermore noted that one can quite plausibly obtain a large
$\nu_L^\mu-\nu_L^\tau$ oscillation angle, as observed, in spite of highly
non-degenerate masses of the light neutrinos: e.g. with
$m(\nu_L^\mu)/m(\nu_L^\tau)\approx 1/10-1/20$. Such non-degeneracy is of course
natural to see-saw. In this case, $\nu^e_L - \nu^\mu_L$ oscillation can be
relevant to the small angle MSW explanation of the solar neutrino puzzle.
Implications of the mass of $\nu^\tau_L$ suggested by the SK result, on proton
decay are noted. Comments are made at the end on how the SuperKamiokande result
supplements the LEP result in selecting out the route to higher unification.

happens that one should consider the initial states to be singulary dependent

done by systematically using the theory of closed model categories (cmc). Our
main results are: a definition of n-stacks in terms of limits, which should be
perfectly general for stacks of any type of objects; several other
characterizations of n-stacks in terms of ``effectivity of descent data'';
construction of the stack associated to an n-prestack; a strictification result
saying that any ``weak'' n-stack is equivalent to a (strict) n-stack; and a
descent result saying that the (n+1)-prestack of n-stacks (on a site) is an
(n+1)-stack. As for other examples, we start from a ``left Quillen presheaf''
of cmc's and introduce the associated Segal 1-prestack. For this situation, we
prove a general descent result, giving sufficient conditions for this prestack
to be a stack. This applies to the case of complexes, saying how complexes of
sheaves of $\Oo$-modules can be glued together via quasi-isomorphisms. This was
the problem that originally motivated us.

distinct ways in which non-Markovian behavior can arise; a mode dependent
coupling between bath (reservoir) and system, a dispersive bath, and by
spectral detection of the output into the bath. In the first two cases the
non-Markovian behavior is intrinsic to the interaction, in the third case the
non-Markovian behavior arises from the method of detection. We focus in detail
on the trajectories which simulate real-time spectral detection of the light
emitted from a localized system. In this case, the non-Markovian behavior
arises from the uncertainty in the time of emission of particles that are later
detected. The results of computer simulations of the spectral detection of the
spontaneous emission from a strongly driven two-level atom are presented.

O(3,1) and multi-field sigma models. Such 'universality' of the ALH becomes
more transparent in the framework of the Hirota's bilinear method. The ALH,
