along with those from a {\it ROSAT} observation. The 0.6--10 keV continuum is
consistent with a powerlaw with $\Gamma \sim 1.6$, flatter than that typically
observed in Seyfert galaxies. Fe $K$-shell emission is observed with an EW and
profile typical of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The {\it ASCA} observations in 1993
reveal absorption by a screen $N_{H,z}^{ion} \simeq 3\times10^{21} cm^{-2}}$ of
ionized material with $U_X \simeq 0.01$. Joint analysis of the {\it ASCA} and
{\it ROSAT} data show an additional screen of neutral material instrinsic to
NGC 3227 with $N_{H,z}^{neu} \sim $few$\times10^{20} cm^{-2}}$. NGC 3227
exhibits spectral variability both within and between the observations, due to
short-term variability in the continuum emission and longer-term variability in
the absorption. Time-resolved spectroscopy show the continuum steepened by
$\Delta \Gamma \simeq 0.1$ during a flare of duration $\sim 10^4$s. The column
increased by a factor of $\sim10$ by the 1995 epoch, while the continuum is
consistent with that observed in 1993. The 1995 data also show evidence that
the warm absorber allows $\sim$10% of the nuclear emission to escape without
attenuation.

upon the analysis of ASCA data. We find the X-ray flux varied by a factor ~2 on
a time scale of a few thousand seconds. The source showed significantly higher
amplitude of variability in the 0.5-2 keV band than in the 2-10 keV band. The
continuum is adequately parameterized as a Gamma ~ 2.5 power-law across the
0.6--10 keV band . We confirm the recent discovery of an emission line of high
equivalent width, due to Fe K-shell emission from highly-ionized material.
These ASCA data show the Fe line profile to be broad and asymmetric and
tentatively suggest it is stronger during the X-ray flares, consistent with an
origin from the inner parts of an accretion disk. The X-ray spectrum is complex
below 2 keV, possibly due to emission from a blend of soft X-ray lines, which
would support the existence of an ionized reprocessor, most likely due to a
relatively high accretion rate in this source.

of a ``non-interacting'' warped galaxy. We report here the discovery of two
interactions with companion dwarf galaxies that substantially change this
picture. First, a faint ring structure is discovered around this galaxy that is
likely due to the tidal disruption of a companion dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The
ring is elliptical in shape with the center of NGC5907 close to one of the
ring's foci. This suggests the ring material is in orbit around NGC5907. No
gaseous component to the ring has been detected either with deep H$\alpha$
images or in Very Large Array (VLA) HI 21-cm line maps. The visible material in
the ring has an integrated luminosity <= 10^8 L_sun and its brightest part has
a color R-I ~ 0.9. All of these properties are consistent with the ring being a
tidally-disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Second, we find that NGC5907 has a
dwarf companion galaxy, PGC54419, projected to be only 36.9 kpc from the center
of NGC5907, close in radial velocity (\Delta V = 45 km s^{-1}) to the giant
spiral galaxy. This dwarf is seen at the tip of the HI warp and in the
direction of the warp. Hence, NGC5907 can no longer be considered
``non-interacting,'' but is obviously interacting with its dwarf companions
much as the Milky Way interacts with its dwarf galaxies. These results, coupled
with the finding by others that dwarf galaxies tend to be found around giant
galaxies, suggest that tidal interaction with companions, even if containing a
mere 1% of the mass of the parent galaxy, might be sufficient to excite the
warps found in the disks of many large spiral galaxies.

constrain the properties of an energy component which may have contributed to

be less than -0.55 (95% confidence) for any value of Omega_m and is further
limited to alpha_x<-0.60 (95%) if Omega_m is assumed to be greater than 0.1 .
These values are inconsistent with the unknown component being topological
defects such as domain walls, strings, or textures. The supernova data are
consistent with a cosmological constant (alpha_x=-1) or a scalar field which
has had, on average, an equation of state parameter similar to the cosmological
constant value of -1 over the redshift range of z=1 to the present. Supernova

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/306530","Kyoto-98-01","astro-ph",,"  We investigate evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM), considering the
relaxation process between the ions and electrons. According to the standard
scenario of structure formation, ICM is heated by the shock in the accretion
flow to the gravitational potential well of the dark halo. The shock primarily
heats the ions because the kinetic energy of an ion entering the shock is
larger than that of an electron by the ratio of masses. Then the electrons and
ions exchange the energy through coulomb collisions and reach the equilibrium.
  From simple order estimation we find that the region where the electron
temperature is considerably lower than the ion temperature spreads out on a Mpc
scale. We then calculate the ion and electron temperature profiles by combining
the adiabatic model of two-temperature plasma by Fox & Loeb (1997) with
spherically symmetric N-body and hydrodynamic simulations based on three
different cosmological models. It is found that the electron temperature is
about a half of the mean temperature at radii $\sim$ 1 Mpc. This could lead to
an about 50 % underestimation in the total mass contained within $\sim$ 1 Mpc
when the electron temperature profiles are used. The polytropic indices of the
electron temperature profiles are $\simeq 1.5$ whereas those of mean
temperature $\simeq 1.3$ for $r \geq 1$ Mpc. This result is consistent both
with the X-ray observations on electron temperature profiles and with some
theoretical and numerical predictions about mean temperature profiles.

disagreement with the value of the D/H ratio as measured toward Capella by
Linsky et al. (1993, 1995). We re-analyze the GHRS data of the Capella line of
sight, and confirm their estimate, as we find: (D/H)_Capella = 1.56 +/- 0.1 x
10**-5, in the Local Interstellar Cloud in which the Sun is embedded. This
shows that the D/H ratio varies by at least 30% within the local interstellar
medium (not to be confused with the Local Interstellar Cloud).
  Furthermore, the Local Interstellar Cloud is also detected toward our target
G191-B2B, and we show that the D/H ratio in this component, toward G191-B2B,
can be made compatible with that derived toward Capella. However, this comes at
the expense of a much smaller value for the D/H ratio as averaged over the
other two components, of order 0.9 x 10**-5, and in such a way that the D/H
ratio, as averaged over all three components, remains at the above value, i.e.
1.12 x 10**-5.

formation process. In nature, the biasing is epoch dependent and recent deep
survey of the galaxy shows the large biasing at high redshift. Hence, we
investigate quasi non-linear evolution of the stochastic bias by using the tree
level perturbation method. Especially, the influence of the initial cross
correlation on the evolution of the skewness and the bi-spectrum is examined in
detail. We find that the non-linear bias can be generated dynamically. The
small value of the initial cross correlation can bend the $\dg$-$\dm$ relation
effectively and easily lead to the negative curvature ($b_2<0$). We also
propose a method to predict the bias, cross correlation and skewness at high
redshift. As an illustration, the possibility of the large biasing at high
redshift is discussed. Provided the present bias parameter as $b=1.5$ and
$\Omega=1.0$, we predict the large scale bias as $b=4.63$ at $z=3$ by fitting
the bi-spectrum to the Lick catalog data. Our results will be important for the

states is not large and is in the typical for transition metals range. We find
substantial deviations from Drude behavior in the far-infrared optical
conductivity. These appear because of the unusually low energy of interband
optical transitions. The calculated mass renormalization is found to be rather
sensitive to the exchange-correlation functional used and varies from 10%
(LSDA) to 90% (GGA), using the latest specific heat data. We also find that
dressing of the electrons by spin fluctuations, because of their high energy,
renormalizes the interband optical transition at as high as 4 eV by about 20%.
Although we find no clear indications of strong correlations of the Hubbard
type, strong electron-magnon scattering related to the half metallic band
structure is present and this leads to a nontrivial temperature dependence of
the resistivity and some renormalization of the electron spectra.

anomalously strong quasielastic component, however, develops at small wave

layers undergoing stick-slip motion, along with simultaneous imaging. A full
study has been done for spherical particles with a +-20% size distribution.
Stick-slip motion due to repetitive fluidization of the layer occurs for low
driving velocities. Between major slip events, slight creep occurs that is
variable from one event to the next. The effects of changing the stiffness k
and velocity V of the driving system are studied in detail. The stick-slip
motion is almost periodic for spherical particles over a wide range of
parameters, but becomes irregular when k is large and V is relatively small. At
larger V, the motion becomes smoother and is affected by the inertia of the
upper plate bounding the layer. Measurements of the period T and amplitude A of
the relative motion are presented as a function of V. At a critical value Vc, a
transition to continuous sliding motion occurs that is discontinuous for k not
too large. The time dependence of the instantaneous velocity of the upper plate
and the frictional force produced by the granular layer are determined within
individual slipping events. The force is a multi-valued function of the
instantaneous velocity, with pronounced hysteresis and a sudden drop prior to
resticking. Measurements of vertical displacement reveal a small dilation of
the material (about one tenth of the mean particle size in a layer 20 particles
deep) associated with each slip event. Finally, optical imaging reveals that
localized microscopic rearrangements precede (and follow) each slip event. The
behavior of smooth particles is contrasted with that of rough particles.

sufficient conditions such that a given symmetry reduction can be performed at
the level of the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. (2) I discuss the Hamiltonian

particular, I explain how these models can be identified with parametrized
field theories of wave maps, thus a natural strategy for canonical quantization

arbitrary foliations of spacetime. I discuss some recent results on the

nuclear applications at photon equivalent energies up to 1 GeV. The model
contains Born terms, vector mesons and nucleon resonances ($P_{33}(1232)$,
$P_{11}(1440)$, $D_{13}(1520)$, $S_{11}(1535)$, $F_{15}(1680)$, and
$D_{33}(1700)$). The resonance contributions are included taking into account
unitarity to provide the correct phases of the pion photoproduction multipoles.
The $Q^2$ dependence of electromagnetic resonance vertices is described with
appropriate form factors in the electromagnetic helicity amplitudes. Within
this model we have obtained good agreement with the experimental data for pion
photo- and electroproduction on the nucleon for both differential cross
sections and polarization observables. The model can be used as a starting
point to predict and analyze forthcoming data.

in a relativistic, non-local model, which we have previously applied to the

extrapolations of the elementary production operator lead to large effects in
the cross section. We also show that the almost complete suppression of the
N(1535) seen in earlier studies on this reaction is a result of the local or
factorization approximation used in these works. Non-local effects can lead to
a considerable contribution from this resonance. The relative size of the
N(1535) contribution depends on the structure of the nucleus under
consideration. We give an estimate for the contribution of the N(1520)
resonance and discuss the effect of an $\eta$-nucleus optical potential

Similar difficulties turn out to be present in the case of the
(boson-)coherent-state path integral as well; although partially circumventable
by an ingenious trick (Klauder's $\epsilon$-prescription) at the ""classical
level"", they manifest themselves at the level of fluctuations. Detailed
analysis of the origin of these difficulties makes it clear that the only way
of avoiding them is to work with the proper discrete-time formalism. The thesis
is explicitly illustrated with a harmonic oscillator and a spin under a
constant magnetic field.
