resolved four-band internal colour data to the predictions of evolutionary
synthesis models. We quantify the relative age, dispersion in age, ongoing
star-formation rate, star-formation history, and dust content of these
galaxies. To demonstrate the potential of the method, we study the
near-complete sample of 32 I<21.9 mag galaxies with <z> ~ 0.5 studied by
Bouwens et al (1997). The dispersion of the internal colours of a sample of
0.4<z<1 early-type field galaxies in the HDF indicates that ~40% [4/11] show
evidence of star formation which must have occurred within the past third of
their ages at the epoch of observation. For a sample of well-defined spirals,
we similarly exploit the dispersion in colour to analyse the relative histories
of bulge and disc stars, in order to resolve the current controversy regarding
the ages of galactic bulges. Dust and metallicity gradients are ruled out as
major contributors to the colour dispersions we observe in these systems. The
median ages of bulge stars are found to be signicantly older than those in
galactic discs, and exhibit markedly different star-formation histories. This
result is inconsistent with a secular growth of bulges from disc instabilities,
but consistent with gradual disc formation by accretion of gas onto bulges, as
predicted by hierarchical theories. We extend our technique in order to discuss
the star formation history of the entire Bouwens et al sample in the context of
earlier studies concerned with global star formation histories.

geometrically and optically thin spherical shells in uniform expansion or
rotation are considered here so as to emphasise the information content

case of expansion, the line emission can increase by significant factors and
the time variation of the profile shape is symmetric about line centre. For
uniform rotation the line emission also increases significantly, but the time
evolution of the profile shape is distinctly asymmetric. Thus, microlensing is
seen to yield information about the velocity field in the extended envelope. We
elaborate on (a) the observational advantages of tailoring microlensing
programs toward detecting extended circumstellar envelopes, (b) the use of
multiline observations to infer other properties of the envelopes, such as the
ionization stratification, (c) the use of the continuum excess emission at

based on a low-resolution spectrum.
  Using HIRES, we have searched for the Li I resonance line. Combining the
absence/presence of lithium and photometry of the faint Alpha Persei targets
with confirmed membership constrains their ages and masses. The lack of lithium
in AP J0323+4853 implies its age is greater than about 65 Myr, which is older
than the cluster classical upper main-sequence turnoff age of 50 Myr. A similar
age discrepancy is found in the Pleiades. We detect lithium in the faintest of
our program stars, AP270, which implies a mass for it just at the substellar
mass limit, given our adopted age and its luminosity. The membership of AP281
is in question because of its high radial velocity compared with the cluster
mean. On the other hand AP281 lies on the photometric cluster sequence, and has
a very high rotation velocity and H-alpha emission, indicating youth. If a
member, its lack of lithium would push the minimum age of the cluster to 75
Myr, in agreement with a very recent upper main-sequence determination. In that
case, AP270 would not be a brown dwarf.

sources. However, due to the smaller surface density of radio sources, when
compared to optical galaxies, such lensed events are rare. For an example, it
is expected that there is no lensed radio source due to foreground galaxy
clusters in the 1.4 GHz VLA FIRST survey. However, at the $\mu$Jy level, the
surface density of radio sources increases. Using the radio properties of the
Hubble Deep Field (HDF) galaxies, we calculate the expected number of
gravitationally lensed $\mu$Jy rad io sources on the sky due to foreground
galaxy clusters for different cosmological models. For a flat cosmology with

radio surveys. Given the recent detection of a sub-mm selected lensed muJy
radio source towards A370, it is suggested that deep radio observations of

flux distribution for sources in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). Using the HDF
luminosity function, we also account for the magnification bias in
magnitude-limited observational programs to find lensed optical arcs. Based on
the results from optical arc surveys, we find that the observed number of arcs
can easily be explained in a flat universe with low values for cosmological
mass density of the universe. At radio wavelengths (1.4 GHz), we predict \sim
1500 lensed radio sources with flux densities greater than 10 muJy, and with

the central regions of ultraluminous infrared galaxies like Arp 220.
Ultraluminous galaxies are thought to be triggered by galaxy mergers, and it
has often been argued that these super star clusters may form during violent
collisions between gas clouds in the final phase of the mergers. We now
investigate another set of models which differ from previous ones in that the
formation of the super star clusters is linked directly to the very intense
starburst occurring at the very center of the galaxy. Firstly we show that a
scenario in which the super star clusters form in material compressed by shock
waves originating from the central starburst is implausible because the objects
so produced are much smaller than the observed star clusters in Arp 220. We
then investigate a scenario (based on the Shlosman-Noguchi model) in which the
infalling dense gas disk is unstable gravitationally and collapses to form
massive gaseous clumps. Since these clumps are exposed to the external high
pressure driven by the superwind (a blast wave driven by a collective effect of
a large number of supernovae in the very core of the galaxy), they can collapse
and then massive star formation may be induced in them. The objects produced in
this kind of collapse have properties consistent with those of the observed
super star clusters in the center of Arp 220.

significant CH2Cl2 hydrolysis occurs under subcritical temperatures, while
relatively little hydrolysis occurs under supercritical conditions. These

accounting for this behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results
show that increases in the activation energy and a changing reaction profile

comparing the holographic images obtained from experimental and calculated data
we illuminate validity, current limits and possible shortcomings of the method.
In particular, we show that periodic vacancies such as cornerholes may inhibit
the correct detection of the atomic positions. By contrast, the extra
diffraction intensity due to slight substrate reconstructions, as for example
buckling, seems to have negligible influence on the images. Due to the spatial
information depth of the method the stacking of the cluster can be imaged down

simulations, the decay happens immediately, in a time scale of order the light
travel time, and the average energy of the radiated axions is $<\omega_a >
\simeq 7 m_a$ for $v_a/m_a \simeq 500$. $<\omega_a>$ is found to increase
approximately linearly with $\ln(v_a/m_a)$. Extrapolation of this behaviour
yields $<\omega_a> \sim 60 m_a$ in axion models of interest. We find that the
contribution to the cosmological energy density of axions from wall decay is of
the same order of magnitude as that from vacuum realignment, with however large
uncertainties. The velocity dispersion of axions from wall decay is found to be
larger, by a factor $10^3$ or so, than that of axions from vacuum realignment
and string decay. We discuss the implications of this for the formation and
evolution of axion miniclusters and for the direct detection of axion dark
matter on Earth. Finally we discuss the cosmology of axion models with $N>1$ in
which the domain wall problem is solved by introducing a small U$_{PQ}$(1)
breaking interaction. We find that in this case the walls decay into
gravitational waves.

particular, we determine the sensitivity to parameters of various models. We
find that in many interesting models which attempt to address the

measurement in both the $B_s$ and $B_d$ systems one can hope to constrain the
flavor physics model, especially once squarks are detected and their masses
measured. Thus, lepton charge asymmetries can be used as an alternative means
of searching for new physics and distinguishing among potential solutions to
the flavor problem. They are interesting precisely because they are small in
the standard model and are therefore necessarily evidence of new physics.

For Ising models coupled to random surfaces, finite size effects are studied on
the one hand by numerical generation of the partition function to arbitrary
accuracy by a deterministic calculus, and on the other hand by an analytic
theory based on the singularity analysis of the explicit parametric form of the
free energy of the corresponding matrix model. Both these reveal that the form
of the finite size corrections, not surprisingly, depend on the string
susceptibility. For the general case where the parametric form of the matrix
model free energy is not explicitly known, it is shown how to perform the
singularity analysis. All these considerations also apply to other observables
like susceptibility etc. In the case of the Ising model it is shown that the

lambda), with the obvious new consequence concerning the possible value of No.
Specifically, the case No(M)= lambda is possible when theta^kappa < lambda for
every theta < lambda.

"math/9807183","Shelah Office","Saharon Shelah","Strong dichotomy of cardinality",,,,"Shelah [Sh:664]","math.LO",,"  A usual dichotomy is that in many cases, reasonably definable sets, satisfy
the CH, i.e. if they are uncountable they have cardinality continuum. A strong
dichotomy is when: if the cardinality is infinite it is continuum as in
[Sh:273]. We are interested in such phenomena when lambda = aleph_0 is replaced
by lambda regular uncountable and also by lambda = beth_omega or more generally
by strong limit of cofinality aleph_0 .

the Pauli equation by copying the line of arguments used in the spin-0 case,
i.e. the Schr\""{o}dinger equation, is ambiguous. We show that a
non-relativistic reduction of the relativistic Dirac four-vector current is,
however, capable of fully resolving the problem. This analysis reveals that the
non-relativistic current of the Pauli equation should include an extra term of
the form $\vec \nabla \vec \times (\psi^{\dagger} \vec \sigma \psi)$. We
present an initial exploration of the potential consequences of this new
'spin-term' by solving the Pauli equation for crossed magnetic and electric
fields and calculating the corresponding current.

of quasi-2d non-neutral plasma in an axial magnetic field), large elliptical
vortices in a finite disk are stable. The stability is established by
comparison between energy of elliptical and symmetrical states to satisfy a
sufficient condition, without dynamical eigen-analysis. Analytical small
ellipticity expansion of energy and exact numerical values for finite
ellipticity are both obtained. The expansion indicates stable linear l=2
diocotron modes for large vortices (or plasma columns). Numerical simulations
of the 2d Euler equation are also performed. They not only confirm the
sufficient condition, but also show that the stability persists to smaller
vortex sizes. The reason why decaying l=2 modes were obtained by Briggs,
Daugherty, and Levy [Phys. Fluids 13, 421 (1970)] using eigen-analysis is also
discussed.

  Symmetries of Stokes Graphs","62 pages, 17 EPS figuures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  It has been shown that the cases of the JWKB formulae in 1--dim QM quantizing
the energy levels exactly are results of essentially one global symmetry of
both potentials and their corresponding Stokes graphs. Namely, this is the
invariance of the latter on translations in the complex plain of the space
variable i.e. the potentials and the Stokes graphs have to be periodic. A
proliferation of turning points in the basic period strips (parallelograms) is
another limitation for the exactness of the JWKB formulae. A systematic
analyses of a single-well class of potentials satisfying suitable conditions
has been performed. Only ten potentials (with one or two real parameters)
quantized exactly by the JWKB formulae have been found all of them coinciding
(or being equivalent to) with the well-known ones found previously. It was
shown also that the exactness of the supersymmetric JWKB formulae is a
consequence of the corresponding exactness of the conventional ones and vice
versa. Because of the latter two exactly JWKB quantized potentials have been
additionally established. These results show that the exact SUSY JWKB formulae
choose the Comtet at al form of them independently of whether the supersymmetry
is broken or not. A close relation between the shape invariance property of
potentials considered and their meromorphic structure on the x-plane is also
demonstrated.
