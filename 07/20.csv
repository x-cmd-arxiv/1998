stellar spectral energy distributions of stars in the GRB970228 field to the

Finally we estimate the extinction using the Balmer emission line ratios of a
galaxy in the GRB970228 field, and the neutral hydrogen column density and
amount of infrared dust emission toward this field. Combining the results of
these methods, we find a best-fit galactic extinction in the optical of
$A_V=1.19^{+0.10}_{-0.17}$, which implies a a substantial dimming and change of

reasonably large values of \Omega, as is probably suggested by the radio

here t_m is the epoch in months when the associated radio-blastwave degrades to
become mildly relativistic. We discuss that it is unlikely that this energy,
Q_{FB}~sim 10^{53}erg was liberated by the central engine by a direct
electromagnetic mode. On the other hand, as conceived by several previous
authors and as is suggested by supernova theories, their FB driving the blast
wave is likely to be preceded by a much stronger neutrino burst: \nu + anti
\nu- e^+ +e^-. Although, the efficiency for pair production by this latter
route is usually found to be as low as ~.001, we point out that for very high
values of neutrino energy release Q_\nu >Q_{FB}, it is possible that, its value
increses substantially. By considering that, the value of $Q_{FB}$ for such
GRBs is indeed ~sim 10^{53} erg, we envisage that the energy of the actual
neutrino burst/wind could be as high as ~ 10^{54-55} erg. This energy might be
had from general relativistic collapse of a massive stellar core having INITIAL
gravitational mass, say, M_i~ few~M_sun to a stage having a potential well much
deeper than what is present on a canonican neutron star surface. Accordingly,
we predict that the new generation large nu elescopes may detect neutrino burst

partial differential equations arising from extremisation of the effective
action for pseudospin textures. We also calculate the different contributions
to the energy of our bimerons, coming from pseudospin stiffness, capacitance
and coulomb interactions between the merons. Apart from augmenting earlier
results, this allows us to check how good an approximation it is to think of
the bimeron as a pair of rigid objects (merons) with logarithmically growing
energy, and with electric charge ${1 \over 2}$. Our differential equation
approach also allows us to study the dependence of the spin texture as a
function of the distance between merons, and the inter layer distance. Lastly,
the technical problem of solving coupled nonlinear partial differential

interesting in its own right.

contributions in the decay amplitude using a Fermi motion (FM) model to
incorporate the $B$-meson wave-function effects. The measured branching ratios
for the inclusive decays $B \to X_s+ (J/\psi,\psi^\prime,...)\to X_s \ell^+
\ell^-$ are used to fix the normalization of the long-distance contribution.
The momentum distribution of the $J/\psi$ measured by the CLEO collaboration is
fitted in the FM model which is then used to calculate the hadronic spectra
from the resonant contribution also away from the $J/\psi$-resonance. We also
study the effect of various descriptions of the resonant and non-resonant
$c\bar{c}$ contributions in $B \to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$ existing in the
literature on the hadron energy and invariant mass spectra, and in the
Forward-Backward asymmetry. Selective cuts on the hadron and dilepton invariant
masses can be used to reduce the $B\bar{B}$ background and resonant
contribution and, as an example, we work out the hadron spectra with the
experimental cuts used by the CLEO collaboration in searching for the decay $B
\to X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$. We show that data from the forthcoming B facilities
could be used effectively to measure the short-distance contribution in $B \to
X_s \ell^+ \ell^-$, enabling precise determination of the FM model and heavy
quark effective theory parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$.

up to some desired order, relatively easily. An explicit example is given for
one particularly interesting case. Similarly the classical and the Jordanian
