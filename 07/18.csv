  ApJ, Oct. 1998",,"10.1086/306293",,"astro-ph",,"  We describe the classical cosmological tests, such as the Log$N$-Log$S$,
redshift-magnitude and angular diameter tests, and propose some new tests of
the evolution of galaxies and the universe. Most analyses of these tests treat
the problem in terms of a luminosity function and its evolution which can lead
to incorrect conclusions when dealing with high redshift sources. We develop a
proper treatment in three parts. In the first part we describe these tests
based on the isophotal values of the quantities such as flux, size or surface
brightness. We show the shortcomings of the simple point source approximation
based solely on the luminosity function and consideration of the flux limit. We
emphasize the multivariate nature of the problem and quantify the effects of
other selection biases due to the surface brightness and angular size
limitations. In these considerations the surface brightness profile plays a
critical role. In the second part we show that considerable simplification over
the complicated isophotal scheme is achieved if these test are carried out in
some sort of metric scheme, for example that suggested by Petrosian (1976).
This scheme, however, is limited to well resolved sources. Finally, we describe
the new tests, which use the data to a fuller extent than the isophotal or
metric based tests, and amount to simply counting the pixels or adding their
intensities as a function of the pixel surface brightness, instead of dealing
with surface brightness, sizes and fluxes of individual galaxies. We show that
the data analysis and its comparison with the theoretical models of the
distributions and evolution of galaxies has the simplicity of the metric test
and utilizes the data more fully than the isophotal test.

proposed by Alcock and Paczynski (1979), using observations of the Lyman-alpha
forest in the spectra of close quasar pairs. By comparing the correlations in
absorption in one quasar spectrum with correlations between the spectra of
neighboring quasars one can determine the relation of the redshift distance
scale to the angle distance scale at the redshift of the absorbers, $z \sim 2 -
4$. Since this relationship depends on the parameters of the cosmological
model, these parameters may be determined using the Lyman-alpha forest. While
this test is relatively insensitive to the density parameter $\Omega_m$ in a
dust-dominated universe, it is more sensitive to the presence of a matter
component with large negative pressure (such as a cosmological constant
$\Lambda$) and its equation of state. With only 25 pairs of quasar spectra at
angular separations $0.5' - 2'$, one can discriminate between an $\Omega_m =
0.3$ open universe ($\Lambda=0$) and an $\Omega_m = 0.3$ flat
($\Lambda$-dominated) universe at the $4-\sigma$ level. The S/N can be enhanced
by considering quasar pairs at smaller angular separations, but requires proper
modeling of nonlinear redshift space distortions. Here the correlations and
redshift space distortions are modeled using linear theory.

the insulating phase very near the metal-insulator transition. For all values
of temperature and stress, the conductivity collapses onto a single universal
scaling curve. For large values of the argument, the scaling function is well
fit by the exponentially activated form associated with variable range hopping
when electron-electron interactions cause a soft Coulomb gap in the density of
states at the Fermi energy. The temperature dependence of the prefactor,
corresponding to the T-dependence of the critical curve, has been determined
reliably for this system, and is proportional to the square-root of T. We show
explicitly that nevlecting the prefactor leads to substantial errors in the
determination of the scaling parameters and the critical exponents derived from
them. The conductivity is not consistent with Mott variable-range hopping in
the critical region nor does it obey this form for any range of the parameters.
Instead, for smaller argument of the scaling function, the conductivity of Si:B
is well fit by an exponential form with exponent 0.31 related to the critical
exponents of the system at the metal- insulator transition.

Haldane gap. Near $H_s$, we take ``low-energy effective S-matrix'' approach,
which gives correct effective bose-gas coupling constant $c$, different from

a critical value $\beta_c(\approx 0.41)$. In the region $0<\beta<\beta_c$, the
effective coupling $c$ is positive but rather small. The small value of $c$
makes the ``critical region'' of the square-root behavior $M\sim \sqrt{H-H_c}$

is found not to vanish, due to the presence of two independent tensor
