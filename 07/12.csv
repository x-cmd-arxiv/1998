1979 to 1997. The 6 cm light curve data from 1995-1997 and the 4 cm data from
1990-1997 are reported here. At 4 cm, the intrinsic source variations occur
earlier and are twice as large as the corresponding variations at 6 cm. The
VLBI core and jet components have different magnification factors, leading to
different flux ratios for the varying and non-varying portions of the VLA light
curves. Using both the PRHQ and Dispersion statistical techniques, we
determined the time delay, core flux ratio, and excess non-varying B image flux
density. The fits were performed for the 4 cm and 6 cm light curves, both
individually and jointly, and we used Gaussian Monte Carlo data to estimate 68%
statistical confidence levels. The delay estimates from each individual
wavelength were inconsistent given the formal uncertainties, suggesting that
there are unmodeled systematic errors in the analysis. We roughly estimate the
systematic uncertainty in the joint result from the difference between the 6 cm
and 4 cm results, giving 409+-30 days for the PRHQ statistic and 397+-20 days
for the Dispersion statistic. These results are consistent with the current
optical time delay of 417+-3 days, reconciling the long-standing difference
between the optical and radio light curves and between different statistical
analyses. The unmodeled systematic effects may also corrupt light curves for
other lenses, and we caution that multiple events at multiple wavelengths may
be necessary to determine an accurate delay in any lens system. Now that
consensus has been reached regarding the time delay in the 0957+561 system, the
most pressing issue remaining for determining H_0 is a full understanding of
the mass distribution in the lens.

exactly homogeneous ground states in many body systems is further analyzed. The
discussion is restricted to zero temperature situation. Firstly, it is argued
that the positivity is equivalent to the requirement that the work needed for
to adiabatically connect a static charge density, be positive. In particular
the rule seems to be a fully appropriate stability condition if the system
interacts with a freely moving but coulomb interacting jellium. This situation
is common in thermodynamical equilibrium discussions, in which the system can
be stable or not in dependence of the relaxation of some external constraints.
Further, an argument based in a quantized electromagnetic field treatment is
also given. It requires the positivity of the dielectric function as an
intrinsic stability condition for the charged system independently of the
jellium dynamics.Possible inmplications for the more complex finite temperature
situation are commented.

low-energy supersymmetry or technicolor. Instead, the problem is nullified by
bringing quantum gravity down to the TeV scale. This is accomplished by the
presence of $n \geq 2$ new dimensions of sub-millimeter size, with the SM
fields localised on a 3-brane in the higher dimensional space. In this paper we
systematically study the experimental viability of this scenario. Constraints
arise both from strong quantum gravitational effects at the TeV scale, and more
importantly from the production of massless higher dimensional gravitons with
TeV suppressed couplings. Theories with $n>2$ are safe due mainly to the
infrared softness of higher dimensional gravity. For $n=2$, the six dimensional
Planck scale must be pushed above $\sim 30$ TeV to avoid cooling SN1987A and
distortions of the diffuse photon background. Nevertheless, the particular
implementation of our framework within type I string theory can evade all
constraints, for any $n \geq 2$, with string scale $m_s \sim 1$ TeV. We also
explore novel phenomena resulting from the existence of new states propagating
in the higher dimensional space. The Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP
problem is revived with a weak scale axion in the bulk. Gauge fields in the
bulk can mediate repulsive forces $\sim 10^6 - 10^8$ times stronger than
gravity at sub-mm distances, and may help stabilize the proton.
Higher-dimensional gravitons produced on our brane and captured on a different
""fat"" brane can provide a natural dark matter candidate.
