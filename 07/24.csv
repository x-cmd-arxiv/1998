potential of the Milky Way. Our study is motivated both by the discovery of the
first lengthy stellar stream in the halo (\cite{it98}) and by the prospect of
measuring proper motions of stars brighter than 20th magnitude in such a stream
with an accuracy of $\sim 4\mu as/$yr, as will be possible with the Space
Interferometry Mission (SIM). We assume that the heliocentric radial velocities
of these stars can be determined from supporting ground-based spectroscopic
surveys, and that the mass and phase-space coordinates of the Galactic
satellite with which they are associated will also be known to SIM accuracy.
Using results from numerical simulations as trial data sets, we find that, if
we assume the correct form for the Galactic potential, we can predict the
distances to the stars as a consequence of the narrow distribution of energy
expected along the streams. We develop an algorithm to evaluate the accuracy of
any adopted potential by requiring that the satellite and stars recombine
within a Galactic lifetime when their current phase-space coordinates are
integrated backwards. When applied to a four-dimensional grid of triaxial
logarithmic potentials, with varying circular velocities, axis ratios and
orientation of the major-axis in the disk plane, the algorithm can recover the
parameters used for the Milky Way in a simulated data set to within a few
percent using only 100 stars in a tidal stream.

data, complemented with optical broad and narrow band imaging, of the B[e] star
HD 87643 are presented. The spectrum of HD 87643 exhibits the hybrid
characteristics well known to be representative of the group of B[e] stars; a
fast wind with an expansion velocity in excess of 1000 km/s is measured in the
hydrogen and helium lines, while a slower component is traced by lower
excitation lines and forbidden lines. Clues to the geometry of the rapidly
expanding circumstellar shell are provided by the startling polarization
changes across Halpha. Comparison with published schematic calculations
indicates that the polarizing material is located in a slowly rotating,
expanding disk structure. A hydrodynamical model is then presented whose
results are consistent with the original two-wind concept for B[e] stars and
exhibits kinematic properties that may well explain the observed spectral
features in HD 87643. The model calculations use as input a B star undergoing
mass loss, surrounded by an optically thick disk. The resulting configuration
consists of a fast polar wind from the star and a slowly expanding disk wind.
The model also predicts that the stellar wind at intermediate latitudes is
slower and denser than in the polar region.

galaxies has brought into sharper focus the question of why elliptical
galaxies, rich in hot gas, do not possess quasar-like luminosities. Recent
studies suggest that advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs), with
associated low radiative efficiency, might provide an explanation for the
observed quiescence. Although ADAF models have been applied to a number of
low-luminosity systems, compelling observational evidence for their existence
is still required. Here, we examine new high-frequency radio observations of
the giant, low-luminosity elliptical galaxies NGC 4649, NGC 4472 and NGC 4636
made with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the sub-millimetre common-user
bolometer array (SCUBA) on the JCMT. At these frequencies the predictions are
very precise and an ADAF is unequivocally characterised by a slowly rising
spectrum with a sharp spectral cut-off produced by thermal synchrotron
radiation. The new radio limits severely disagree with the canonical ADAF
predictions which significantly overestimate the observed flux. While our
observations do not rule out the presence of an ADAF in these objects, they
place strong constraints on the model. If the accretion in these objects occurs
in an advection-dominated mode then our radio limits imply that the emission
from their central regions must be suppressed. We examine the possibility that
the magnetic field in the flow is extremely low or that synchrotron emission is
free-free absorbed by cold material in the accretion flow. We also discuss
whether slow non-radiating accretion flows may drive winds/outflows to remove
energy, angular momentum and mass so that the central densities, pressures and
emissivities are much smaller than in a standard ADAF.

smaller primordial clouds and halos of dwarf galaxies. We see no absorption

at about 0.1 AU/yr. Microlensing events will therefore have different
characteristics as seen from the satellite and the Earth. From the difference,
it is possible in principle to measure v-tilde, the transverse velocity of the
lens projected onto the observer plane. Since v-tilde has very different values
for different populations (disk, halo, Large Magellanic Cloud), such
measurements could help identify the location, and hence the nature, of the
lenses. I show that the method previously developed by Gould for measuring such
satellite parallaxes fails completely in the case of SIRTF: it is overwhelmed
by degeneracies which arise from fact that the Earth and satellite observations
are in different band passes. I develop a new method which allows for
observations in different band passes and yet removes all degeneracies. The
method combines a purely ground-based measurement of the ""parallax asymmetry""
with a measurement of the delay between the time the event peaks at the Earth
and satellite. In effect, the parallax asymmetry determines the component of
v-tilde in the Earth-Sun direction, while the delay time measures the component
of v-tilde in the direction of the Earth's orbit.

most relativistic objects ever discovered: (i) GRBs involve relativistic motion
at a velocity of 0.9999c or larger. (ii) Most current GRB models involve the
formation of a black hole in one way or another. (iii) If binary neutron star

and three families (CHL5). These flat directions have at least an additional
U(1)' unbroken at the string scale. For each flat direction, the complete set
of effective mass terms and effective trilinear superpotential terms in the
observable sector are computed to all orders in the VEV's of the fields in the
flat direction. The ""string selection-rules"" disallow a large number of
couplings allowed by gauge invariance, resulting in a massless spectrum with a
large number of exotics, in most cases excluded by experiment, thus signifying
a generic flaw of these models. Nevertheless, the resulting trilinear couplings
of the massless spectrum possess a number of interesting features which we
analyse for two representative flat directions: for the fermion texture;
baryon- and lepton-number violating couplings; R-parity breaking; non-canonical
mu terms; and the possibility of electroweak and intermediate scale symmetry
breaking scenarios for U(1)'. The gauge coupling predictions are obtained in
the electroweak scale case. Fermion masses possess t-b and tau-mu universality,
with the string scale Yukawa couplings g and $g/\sqrt{2}$, respectively.
Fermion textures are present for certain flat directions, but only in the
down-quark sector. Baryon- and lepton- number violating couplings can trigger
proton-decay, $N-{\bar N}$ oscillations, leptoquark interactions and R-parity
violation, leading to the absence of a stable LSP.

the more usual minimum. However, the potential is quite flat at the top, and

transformations on superspace. A superconformal Killing equation is derived and
its solutions are identified in terms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentz

group OSp(2,6|N), is possible only if the supersymmetry algebra has N spinorial
generators of the same chirality, corresponding to (N,0) supersymmetry. The
R-symmetry group is then Sp(N) and the corresponding superspace is R^{6|8N}. We
define superinversion as a map to the associated superspace of opposite
chirality. General formulae for two-point and three-point correlation functions
of quasi-primary superfields are exhibited. The superconformal group in
six-dimensions is reduced to a corresponding extended superconformal group in
four-dimensions. Superconformally covariant differential operators are also
discussed.

envelopes centred on one of the eigenstates provide an arbitrarily sharp
arrival time.

when the states are not approximately orthogonal. We provide a possible search
algorithm based on an arbitrary unitary transformation which can speed up the
steps still further. We discuss the lower and upper bounds on the transition
matrix elements when the unitary operator changes with time, thereby implying
that quantum search process can not be too fast or too slow. This is a
remarkable feature of quantum computation unlike classical one. Quantum
mechanical uncertainty relation puts bounds on search process. Also we mention
the problems of perturbation and other issues in time-dependent search
operation.

chain) a separation of variables is constructed in the classical case. The
corresponding separated coordinates are obtained as the poles of a suitably
normalized Baker-Akhiezer function. The classical results are generalized to
the quantum case where the kernel of separating integral operator is
constructed. The simplest one-degree-of-freedom case is studied in detail.
