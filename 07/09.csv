DENIS in an area of 1.5 x 3 degrees around the Chamaeleon I molecular cloud.
Most of the 30000 objects detected in the J band are background stars that were
previously used to derive an accurate extinction map of the full area (Cambresy
et al., 1997) using star count method. In the present work, we investigate the
young stellar population of the cloud using the IJK photometric DENIS data. The
whole sample of 126 already known YSOs, which are mainly T Tauri stars, are
identified in the DENIS catalogue. Besides, we propose 54 sources as new
candidates of YSOs. These new faint objects are selected according to their
extremely red near infrared colour, that cannot be explained only by the
reddening of the cloud. Moreover they are concentrated near to the most
obscured areas of the cloud. Although spectroscopic confirmation is badly
requested, they are interpreted as probable classical T Tauri stars that have
escaped previous spectroscopic, IRAS or X-ray observations and pertaining to
the low-end of the luminosity function. Assuming that they are reliable YSOs
with massive accretion disks, and using theoretical pre-main-sequence tracks we
estimate the age of this sample to be ranging from 5 10^5 to 4 10^6 years, an
elapse of time that spans the range between the end of the star formation in
the cloud and the maximum life time of the circumstellar disk.

cooling of a ``hot spot'' on the neutron star surface in which the pulsed X-ray
emission originates. Also presented is the possibility of producing soft lags
via Compton down scattering of hard X-ray photons from the hot spot in the cool

alpha-elements has been investigated by considering all the extant NI
determinations for a total of 9 DLA galaxies. We have estimated the fraction of
iron locked into dust grains to convert the observed [N/Fe] ratios into overall
(dust plus gas) relative abundances, [N/Fe]corr. The ratios [N/alpha] have been
mostly determined by using sulphur as a tracer of alpha-elements which is
unaffected by dust. The [N/Fe] and [N/alpha] ratios show high dispersions, of
one order of magnitude or more, which have no equivalent in other
element-to-element ratios in DLAs. The lowest values of the [N/Fe]corr and
[N/alpha] ratios are at variance with the values measured in Galactic halo
stars of similar metallicity suggesting that part of the DLA galaxies do not
follow the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. The DLA nitrogen abundances and
their dispersion show some similarities with those observed in dwarf galaxies.
The behaviour of nitrogen abundance ratios can be ascribed, in general to the
delayed release of nitrogen in the course of evolution. However it is difficult
to conciliate this interpretation with the lowest [N/alpha] values measured,
since an expected enhancement of alpha-elements respect to the iron-peak
elements is not observed simultaneously in these DLA galaxies. In two cases,
relatively high [N/alpha] values are observed which require also a more complex
chemical evolution to be explained.

the structure of their surrounding dark halos is consistent with the universal
density profile proposed by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW profiles). Rotation
curve shape is a strong function of galaxy surface brightness: low-surface
brightness galaxies (LSBs) have slowly rising rotation curves while in
high-surface brightness systems the rotation speed rises sharply and stays flat
or even declines beyond the optical radius. These observations are consistent
with NFW halo profiles, with the possible exception of a few LSBs where the
rotation curves are better described by shallower central density profiles.
Consistency with observational trends requires that halos have lower
characteristic densities than expected in the standard biased cold dark matter
(CDM) scenario, but roughly compatible with COBE-normalized, low-density, flat
CDM universes. The data also imply that disk mass-to-light ratios increase
gently with luminosity, and that the halo circular velocity, V_200, is not
directly proportional to the disk rotation speed, V_rot. Slowly rotating disks
are surrounded by halos of higher circular velocities, whereas faster rotators
(V_rot > 150 km/s) are all surrounded by halos of similar mass, corresponding
to V_200 ~ 200 km/s. We speculate that this is because the efficiency of
assembly of baryons into galaxies is high in massive halos, leading to disks
too massive to be stable in systems that exceed the ``critical'' V_200 ~ 200
km/s. This modeling also provides a natural explanation for the distribution of
sizes and rotation speeds of disk galaxies. (Abridged.)

generate a superstrong magnetic field(SSM). The beam of the energy from the
super strongly magnetized milli second pulsar can punch a hole in the supernova
ejecta . Then the beam of gamma rays flows out of the ejecta. If we observe
this beam from the lateral direction, it will be NHE-GRB. In this model the
pulsar with the spin period about 1sec should exist in SN1998bw so that the
searches for this pulsar in all the wave length are urgent. SSM-MSPs can
accelerate protons up to Ultra High Energy. If a few percent of the beam energy

  V810 Cen is a multi-periodic small amplitude variable star, whose amplitudes
are variable with time. The period of the main mode, 156 d, is in agreement
with the Period--Luminosity--Colour relation for supergiants. This mode is most
probably the fundamental radial one. According to the theoretical pulsation
periods for the radial modes, calculated from a linear non-adiabatic analysis,
the period of the observed second mode, 107 d, is much too long to correspond
to the first radial overtone . Thus, this second mode could be a non-radial
p-mode. Other transient periods are observed, in particular at 187 d. The l
ength of this period suggests a non-radial g-mode. Then, the complex
variability of V810 Cen could be due to a mixing of unstable radial and
non-radial p- and g-modes.

2-matrix are considered for a homogeneous Bose liquid. With the Bogoliubov
principle of the correlation weakening it is proved that the distribution of
the ""dissociated"" pair states over momenta is exactly the product of the
single-particle distribution functions. Thus, the ""dissociated"" pair states are
naturally classified as condensate-condensate, condensate-supracondensate and
supracondensate-supracondensate ones provided the Bose-Einstein condensate
exists. The condensate-condensate as well as condensate-supracondensate PWF are
expressed in terms of the averages of products of the creation and destruction
Bose operators. This leads to the simple interpretation of the anomalous
averages as the ""scattering parts"" of the condensate-condensate and
condensate-supracondensate PWF. It is shown that in contrast to the Fermi
liquid, the appearance of the anomalous averages for the Bose liquid does not
necessarily mean that there exist bound states of pairs of particles. The PWF
in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach are found. Given the density of
the condensate is not zero, there are no bound pair states in the HFB scheme.
The expansion of the pair correlation function in the set of PWF is very useful
in order to take into account both short-range and long-range spatial
correlations. Applications (possible and already realized) of the formalism
developed are discussed.

bacterial colonies. In a bacterial colony with branching pattern, there are
discrete entities - bacteria - which are only two orders of magnitude smaller
than the elements of the macroscopic pattern. We present two types of models.
The first is the Communicating Walkers model, a hybrid model composed of both
continuous fields and discrete entities - walkers, which are coarse-graining of
the bacteria. Models of the second type are systems of reaction diffusion
equations, where the branching of the pattern is due to non-constant diffusion
coefficient of the bacterial field. The diffusion coefficient represents the
effect of self-generated lubrication fluid on the bacterial movement. We
implement the discreteness of the biological system by introducing a cutoff in
the growth term at low bacterial densities. We demonstrate that the cutoff does
not improve the models in any way. Its only effect is to decrease the effective
surface tension of the front, making it more sensitive to anisotropy. We
compare the models by introducing food chemotaxis and repulsive chemotactic
signaling into the models. We find that the growth dynamics of the
Communication Walkers model and the growth dynamics of the Non-Linear diffusion
model are affected in the same manner. From such similarities and from the
insensitivity of the Communication Walkers model to implicit anisotropy we
conclude that the increased discreteness, introduced be the coarse-graining of
the walkers, is small enough to be neglected.

calculation of the average Density of States (DOS) in two and three dimensions.
We propose a new approximate scheme that allows for the inclusion of local
order effects in finite geometries and extrapolates the behavior of infinite
systems following `finite-size scaling' ideas. We particularly investigate the
limit of the Quantum Site Percolation regime described by a tight-binding
Hamiltonian. This limit was chosen to probe the role of short range order (SRO)
properties under extreme conditions. The method is numerically highly efficient
and asymptotically exact in important limits, predicting the correct DOS
structure as a function of the SRO parameters. Magnetic field effects can also
be included in our model to study the interplay of local order and the shifted
quantum interference driven by the field. The average DOS is highly sensitive
to changes in the SRO properties, and striking effects are observed when a
magnetic field is applied near the segregated regime. The new effects observed
are twofold: there is a reduction of the band width and the formation of a gap
in the middle of the band, both as a consequence of destructive interference of
electronic paths and the loss of coherence for particular values of the
magnetic field. The above phenomena are periodic in the magnetic flux. For
other limits that imply strong localization, the magnetic field produces minor
changes in the structure of the average DOS.

concentration in the two layers. We compare several single-particle and
magnetic excitations, namely, the single particle scattering rate, the spectral
function and the spin lattice as well as spin-spin relaxation times in the two
layers as a function of $\delta$. We show that the induced interlayer magnetic
coupling produces a tendency to ``equalization'' of the magnetic properties in
the two layers whereby antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed in the
less doped layer and enhanced in the heavily doped one. The strong
antiferromagnetic bilayer coupling causes the charge carriers in the plane with
larger doping concentration to behave similar to those of the underdoped layer,
they are coupled to. This effect grows for decreasing temperature. For high
temperatures or if both layers are optimally or overdoped, i.e. when the
antiferromagnetic correlation length becomes of the order or smaller than one
lattice site the charge carrier and magnetic dynamics of the two layers is
disconnected and the equalization effect disappears. These results are in good
agreement with NMR experiments on Y2Ba4Cu7O15 by Stern et al. [Phys. Rev B 51,

Si-on-sapphire device led to the conclusion that both conductivity and phonon
drag thermopower $S^g$ are affected to the same relative extent by weak
localization. The present paper presents further experimental and theoretical
results on these transport coefficients for two very low mobility 2D electron
gases in $\delta-$doped GaAs/Ga$_x$Al$_{1-x}$As quantum wells. The experiments
were carried out in the temperature range 3-7K where phonon drag dominates the
thermopower and, contrary to the previous work, the changes observed in the
thermopower due to weak localization were found to be an order of magnitude
less than those in the conductivity. A theoretical framework for phonon drag
thermopower in 2D and 3D semiconductors is presented which accounts for this
insensitivity of $S^g$ to weak localization. It also provides transparent
physical explanations of many previous experimental and theoretical results.

self-gravitating matter flows on black holes, and subject the code to these

gravitational radiation induced by the presence of the matter fields and the

the contributions of decuplet intermediate states are important in the

derived from a mutilated quantum commutator between coordinate and momentum, is
applied to describe the modes and wave packets of Hawking particles evaporated

that the Hawking particle no longer hugs the horizon at arbitrarily close
distances. Rather the mode of Schwarzschild frequency $\omega$ deviates from
the conventional trajectory when the coordinate $r$ is given by $| r -
2M|\simeq \beta_H \omega / 2 \pi$ in units of the non local distance legislated
into the uncertainty relation. Wave packets straddle the horizon and spread out
to fill the whole non local region. The charge carried by the packet (in the
sense of the amount of ""stuff"" carried by the Klein--Gordon field) is not
conserved in the non--local region and rapidly decreases to zero as time
decreases. Read in the forward temporal direction, the non--local region thus
is the seat of production of the Hawking particle and its partner. The KMM
model was inspired by string theory for which the mutilated commutator has been
proposed to describe an effective theory of high momentum scattering of zero
mass modes. It is here interpreted in terms of dissipation which gives rise to
the Hawking particle into a reservoir of other modes (of as yet unknown
origin). On this basis it is conjectured that the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy
finds its origin in the fluctuations of fields extending over the non local
region.

supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N=2. The masses of the two massive

several universality classes, in contrast to what happens in usual K3 x T^2
compactifications, where the N=4 supersymmetry is explicitly broken to N=2, and
where a single universality class appears. These universality properties follow
from the structure of the elliptic genus. The behaviour of the threshold
corrections as functions of the moduli is analysed in detail: it is singular
across several rational lines of the T^2 moduli because of the appearance of
extra massless states, and suffers only from logarithmic singularities at large
radii. These features differ substantially from the ordinary K3 x T^2
compactifications, thereby reflecting the existence of spontaneously-broken N=4

(Hyper-)Kaehler geometry. A general framework for non-commutative geometry is
developed from the point of view of supersymmetry and illustrated in terms of
examples. In particular, the non-commutative torus and the non-commutative
3-sphere are studied in some detail.

a quark model of isospin symmetry breaking, are shown to be inconsistent. The

improved experiments are made. An explicit quark model calculation and mass
relations based on the large-N_c limit with perturbative flavor breaking are
