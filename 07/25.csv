of the surface mass density distribution which allows us to write down a

applied to methods of mass determination from measurements of shear and present
a simplified method of application. The method is demonstrated with cluster

the QCD transition is first order, the sound speed vanishes during the
transition and density perturbations fall freely. For scales below the Hubble
radius at the transition the primordial Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum of density
fluctuations develops large peaks and dips. These peaks grow with wave number
for both the hadron-photon-lepton fluid and for cold dark matter. At the
horizon scale the enhancement is small. This by itself does not lead to the
formation of black holes at the QCD transition. The peaks in the
hadron-photon-lepton fluid are wiped out during neutrino decoupling. For cold
dark matter that is kinetically decoupled at the QCD transition (e.g., axions
or primordial black holes) these peaks lead to the formation of CDM clumps of

  The HRI shows clearly that the sources are extended with the X-ray emission
in NGC3690 coming from at least three regions. The combined 0.1-10 keV spectrum
of NGC3310 can be described by two components, a Raymond-Smith plasma with
temperature kT=0.81^{+0.09}_{-0.12} keV and a hard power-law,
Gamma=1.44^{+0.20}_{-0.11}, (or alternatively a harder Raymond-Smith plasma
with kT ~15 keV), while there is no substantial excess absorption above the
Galactic. The soft component emission is probably due to a super-wind while the
nature of the hard emission is more uncertain with likely origins, X-ray
binaries, inverse Compton scattering of IR photons, an AGN or a very hot gas
component (~10^8 K). The spectrum of NGC3690 is similar, with
kT=0.83^{+0.02}_{-0.04} keV and Gamma=1.56^{+0.11}_{-0.11}. We also employ more
complicated models such as a multi-temperature thermal plasma, a
non-equilibrium ionization code or the addition of a third softer component
which improve the fit but not at a statistically significant level (<2sigma).
These results are similar to recent results on the archetypal star-forming

  Solution to the Strong CP Problem","3 pages + cover, in LATEX with sprocl.sty, talks given by PASCOS 98
  and 4th International Workshop on Particle Phenomenology (Taiwan)",,,"UR-1537, ER/40685/919","hep-ph",,"  The origin of CP violation is a major mystery, especially in relation to the
strong CP problem. CP being a spontaneously broken symmetry could provide an
elegant solution. However, such models have difficulty making themselves
compatible with low-energy supersymmetry, which is popularly accepted as the
solution to the hierarchy problem. We demonstrate that a certain class of low
scale supersymmetric ``Nelson-Barr'' type models can solve the strong and
supersymmetric CP problems while at the same time generating sufficient weak CP
violation in the $K^{0}-\bar{K}^{0}$ system. Gauge-mediated supersymmetry
breaking is used to provide the needed squark mass degeneracies and $A$-term
proportionalities; though that proves to be still insufficient for a generic
Nelson-Barr model. The workable model we consider here, essentially a
supersymmetric version of the aspon model, has the Nelson-Barr mass texture
enforced by a U(1) gauge symmetry, broken at the TeV scale. The resulting model
is predictive with rich phenomenology soon to be available. Feasibility of the
model considered is established by a detailed renormalization group studies.

from the ultraviolet region) are discussed within the infrared finite
coupling-dispersive approach. It is shown how power corrections in Minkowskian
quantities can be derived from the corresponding ones in associated Euclidean
quantities through analyticity, allowing a parametrization in term of the
Euclidean coupling and a renormalon-free perturbative expansion. It is argued
that one should in general expect coefficients functions computed in the true
non-perturbative vacuum to differ from the standard perturbative ones, even
without assuming new physics. A phenomenology of $1/Q^2$ terms arising from
eventual new physics of ultraviolet origin is also set-up. Models for
non-perturbative contributions to the (universal) QCD coupling are suggested.
Issues of renormalization scheme dependence are commented upon.

energy-dependent effective NN-interactions DDM3Y, BDM3Y and HLM3Y based on the

have been analysed. A good agreement with the phenomenological potential of
Lagrange-Lejeune, as well as with the parametrization of
Jeukenne-Lejeune-Mahaux for both neutron and proton double-folded potentials is
obtained. The results indicate that the strongly simplified model interactions
used in preequilibrium reaction theory neglect important dynamical details of

However it might nevertheless be the case that these states can be used for
teleportation, not reliably, but still with fidelity greater than that which
may be achieved with a classical scheme. We show that, at least for some of
these density matrices, teleportation cannot be achieved with better than
classical fidelity.
