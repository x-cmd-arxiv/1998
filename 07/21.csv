one that is almost fully ionized can reveal the character of cosmological
ionizing sources and set important constraints on the stellar birthrate at high
redshifts. The hydrogen component in a highly inhomogeneous universe is
completely reionized when the number of photons emitted above 1 ryd in one
recombination time equals the mean number of hydrogen atoms. If stellar sources
are responsible for photoionizing the IGM at z=5, the rate of star formation at
this epoch must be comparable or greater than the one inferred from optical
observations of galaxies at z=3, and the mean metallicity per baryon in the
universe greater than 1/500 solar. In hierarchical clustering scenarios, high-z
dwarfs (i.e. an early generation of stars in dark matter halos with circular
velocities of order 50 km/s) are expected to be one of the main source of UV
photons and heavy elements at early epochs. They would be very numerous, >0.2
arcsec^{-2}, and faint, I_AB> 29.5 mag: their detection may have to wait for
the Next Generation Space Telescope.

presented. A spherically symmetric radiative transfer code is used to model
these and other CO observations of the carbon star IRC~+10~216/CW Leo. Compared
to previously published model calculations a much larger set of observational
data is used as constraints.
  A grid of models is calculated with the following parameters: luminosity,
mass loss rate, dust-to-gas ratio, dust opacity and CO abundance. A comparison
with CO J = 1-0 data obtained from the literature points towards a preferred
luminosity of 10000-15000 \lsol. Notwithstanding the overall good agreement,
there remain discrepancies.
  The best fitting models (for each of the considered luminosities) cannot
accommodate the more extended emission seen in the mapping data. To fit the
data for radial offsets >50\arcsec the mass loss rate must be a factor of 5
higher in the outer envelope.
  A comparison is made between the mass loss rates and dust-to-gas ratios
derived from the CO modelling and those derived from our previous dust
modelling. The best agreement is obtained for the model with 15000 \lsol.
  We conclude that the likely luminosity of IRC +10 216 is between 10000 and
15000 \lsol and that its distance is between 110 and 135 pc. The present-day
mass loss rate is (1.5 $\pm$ 0.3) $\times 10^{-5}$ \msolyr and the gas-to-dust
ratio is a 700 $\pm$ 100. The dust opacity at 60 $\mu$m is found to be of order
of 250 cm$^2$gr$^{-1}$. The CO abundance is 1.1 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ relative to
H$_2$.

implying that the lines are radiatively pumped by the flares. We also detected
a weak He II (2.189 $\mu$m) emission line on August 14 UTC. The nature of the

in a sample of 90 stars with brightness ranging from K=9-17 and velocities as
large as 1,400+-100 km/sec. Compared to earlier work (Eckart et al. 1997;
Genzel et al. 1997), the source confusion is reduced by a factor of 9, the
number of stars with proper motion measurement in the central 25 arcsec^2 of
our galaxy is doubled, and the accuracy of the velocity measurements in the
central 1 arcsec^2 is improved by a factor of 4. The peaks of both the stellar
surface density and the velocity dispersion are consistent with the position of
the unusual radio source and blackhole candidate, Sgr A*, suggesting that Sgr
A* is coincident (+-0.""1) with the dynamical center of the Galaxy. As a
function of distance from Sgr A*, the velocity dispersion displays a falloff
well fit by Keplerian motion about a central dark mass of 2.6(+-0.2)x10^6 Mo
confined to a volume of at most 10^-6 pc^3, consistent with earlier results.
Although uncertainties in the measurements mathematically allow for the matter
to be distributed over this volume as a cluster, no realistic cluster is
physically tenable. Thus, independent of the presence of Sgr A*, the large
inferred central density of at least 10^12 Mo/pc^3, which exceeds the
volume-averaged mass densities found at the center of any other galaxy, leads
us to the conclusion that our Galaxy harbors a massive central black hole.

suitably normalized scaling exponents shows a remarkable correlation with the
local strength of the Reynolds stress and with the \rms value of helicity

Rev. B 60, 9763 (1999)","10.1103/PhysRevB.60.9763",,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  The thermal decay of linear chains from a metastable state is investigated. A
crossover from rigid to elastic decay occurs when the number of particles, the
single particle energy barrier or the coupling strength between the particles
is varied. In the rigid regime, the single particle energy barrier is small
compared to the coupling strength and the decay occurs via a uniform
saddlepoint solution, with all degrees of freedom decaying instantly.
Increasing the barrier one enters the elastic regime, where the decay is due to
bent saddlepoint configurations using the elasticity of the chain to lower
their activation energy. Close to the rigid-to-elastic crossover, nucleation
occurs at the boundaries of the system. However, in large systems, a second
crossover from boundary to bulk nucleation can be found within the elastic
regime, when the single particle energy barrier is further increased. We
compute the decay rate in the rigid and in the elastic regimes within the
Gaussian approximation. Around the rigid-to-elastic crossover, the calculations
are performed beyond the steepest descent approximation. In this region, the
prefactor exhibits a scaling property. The theoretical results are discussed in
the context of discrete Josephson transmission lines and pancake vortex stacks
that are pinned by columnar defects.

random-variable approximation for $\chi_\mu(s)$, we analytically prove the
perimeter law of the off-diagonal gluon contribution to the Wilson loop in the

the origin of abelian dominance for the long-range physics, we study the

in the next round of experiments. At the LHC the asymmetry can be studied by
selecting appropriately chosen kinematical regions. Furthermore, a slight
preference at LHC for centrally produced antitop is predicted, with top quarks
more abundant at large positive and negative rapidities.

represented by an inner line of this graph where, due to the macroscopic

beam. We show that the field-theoretical approach provides a solid method to
locate all possible conditions and allows to separate unambiguously their
different origins. Some of these conditions are independent of L whereas others
state that coherence is lost when L exceeds a certain ``coherence length''.

is more effective for string than for fields is stressed: the light-front
dynamics for string is that of a true Newtonian many particle system, since a
string bit has a fixed Newtonian mass. In contrast, each particle of a field
theory has a variable Newtonian mass P^+, so the Newtonian analogy actually
requires an infinite number of species of elementary Newtonian particles. This
complication substantially weakens the value of the Newtonian analogy in
applying light-front dynamics to nonperturbative problems. Motivated by the
fact that conventional field theories can be obtained as infinite tension
limits of string theories, we propose a way to recast field theory as a
standard Newtonian system. We devise and analyze some simple quantum mechanical
systems that display the essence of the proposal, and we discuss prospects for
applying these ideas to large N_c QCD.

transferred to a simpler solving of a system of linear algebraic equations,

Production of Tritium (APT) Project. The APT linac comprises both the normal
conducting (below 211 MeV) and superconducting (SC) sections. The high current
leads to stringent restrictions on allowable beam losses (<1 nA/m), that
requires analyzing carefully all possible loss sources. While wake-field
effects are usually considered negligible in proton linacs, we study these
effects for the APT to exclude potential problems at such a high current. Loss
factors and resonance frequency spectra of various discontinuities of the
vacuum chamber are investigated, both analytically and using 2-D and 3-D
simulation codes with a single bunch as well as with many bunches. Our main
conclusion is that the only noticeable effect is the HOM heating of the 5-cell
SC cavities. It, however, has an acceptable level and, in addition, will be
taken care of by HOM couplers.

reproduces very well the true energy shift of the linear Stark effect. The
agreement with the second order effect is poor. It is shown here that the

if the particle arrives, we argue that the time at which it arrives always has

time-of-arrival operators, as well as current operators, is examined
