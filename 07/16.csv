extracted from single exposure images are 80% complete down to B~24, V~23.5 and
I ~22.5 and once coadded should reach about 0.5 mag deeper. The data are being
made public in the form of catalogs, pixel maps, target lists and image

galaxies and the angular two-point correlation function of galaxies are
computed and compared to other available data to evaluate the depth and

of stellar objects are presented and compared to model predictions to examine
the reliability of the colors. The results suggest that the overall quality of
the catalogs extracted from the images is good and suitable for the science

our Local Group have been forming and evolving for a significant fraction of
the age of the Universe. It is not a great leap of logic to further state that
the manner in which they have formed and evolved must be fairly representative
of these processes in general. Unless of course we would like to assume that
our local region of space is in some way peculiar for which there is no
evidence. In other words, if we are able to determine accurate star formation
histories for the nearby galaxies back to the ages of the oldest globular
clusters then we will also obtain a representative picture of how galaxies have
evolved from the earliest times, and predict what nearby galaxies looked like
at intermediate and high redshifts.
  Deep, precision, multi-colour photometry of resolved stellar populations in
external galaxies can uniquely determine the star formation histories of nearby
galaxies going back many Gyrs. Hubble Space Telescope and high quality ground
based imaging have recently resulted in dramatic Colour-Magnitude Diagrams of
the faint old resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies. Although data
deep enough to unambiguously trace back to the very oldest populations does not
yet exist (except for a few small dSphs in the Galaxy Halo), these preliminary
studies make the potential for deeper data for a range of galaxy types look
very exciting. For example, recent results on the very low metallicity dwarf
irregular galaxy Leo A suggests we have found a predominantly, if not entirely,
young galaxy, less than 2 Gyr old, in the Local Group. Nearby faint star
Colour-Magnitude Diagrams thus provide an important and independent method to
confirm the high redshift galaxy survey predictions of galactic evolution.

bright transients which show no quiescent emission as a consequence of
centrifugal inhibition of accretion. Systems with wide orbits are persistent

exposed to energetical influences by the interstellar medium, like e.g.\
stellar radiation, winds or explosions, or by their environment. While the
metallicity depletion in dwarf galaxies can be explained in general by
supernova-driven galactic winds, the reason for their low N/O ratios at low O
abundance is not yet completely understood. Stellar yields enrich the different
gas phases with elements that are characteristic for the stellar progenitors.
Phase transitions are necessary for a mixing of elements, but depend
sensitively on the thermal and dynamical state of the interstellar medium.
Models of chemical evolution start usually with a high N/O ratio at low O
abundance according to a metal enrichment by ancient stellar populations with
common yields, but can only reproduce the N/O-O peculiarity by the application
of multiple starbursts. Their galactic winds are invoked to reduce O
selectively. Chemodynamical models of dwarf galaxies, however, demonstrate that
strong evaporation of clouds by the hot supernova gas leads to an almost
perfect mixing of the interstellar gas. These models can successfully account
for the observed N/O-O values in a self-consistent way without the necessity of
starbursts, if new stellar yields are taken into account which provide
additional secondary N production from massive stars.

more SNRs now have reasonably determined distances. However, many of these
distances were determined kinematically using old rotation curves (based on
$R_{\sun} = 10$ kpc and $V_{\sun} = 250$ km/s). A more modern rotation curve
(based on $R_{\sun} = 8.5$ kpc and $V_{\sun} = 220$ km/s) is used to verify or
recalculate the distances to these remnants. We use a sample of 36 shell SNRs
(37 including Cas A) with known distances to derive a new radio surface
brightness-to-diameter ($\Sigma-D$) relation. The slopes derived here ($\beta =
-2.64$ including Cas A, $\beta = -2.38$ without Cas A) are significantly
flatter than those derived in previous studies. An independent test of the
accuracy of the $\Sigma-D$ relation was performed by using the extragalactic

revised Galactic distribution of SNRs is presented based on the revised
distances as well as those calculated from this $\Sigma-D$ relation. A scaling
method is employed to compensate for observational selection effects by
computing scale factors based on individual telescope survey sensitivities,
angular resolutions and sky coverage. The radial distribution of the surface

event detected towards the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), MACHO Alert 98-SMC-1.
This event was detected early enough to allow intensive observation of the
lightcurve. These observations revealed 98-SMC-1 to be the first caustic
crossing, binary microlensing event towards the Magellanic Clouds to be
discovered in progress.
  Frequent coverage of the evolving lightcurve allowed an accurate prediction
for the date of the source crossing out of the lens caustic structure. The
caustic crossing temporal width, along with the angular size of the source
star, measures the proper motion of the lens with respect to the source, and
thus allows an estimate of the location of the lens. Lenses located in the
Galactic halo would have a velocity projected to the SMC of v^hat ~1500 km/s,
while an SMC lens would typically have v^hat ~60 km/s.
  We have performed a joint fit to the MACHO/GMAN data presented here,
including recent EROS data of this event. These joint data are sufficient to
constrain the time for the lens to move an angle equal to the source angular
radius; 0.116 +/- 0.010 days. We estimate a radius for the lensed source of 1.4
+/- 0.1 R_sun. This yields a projected velocity of v^hat = 84 +/- 9 km/s. Only
0.15% of halo lenses would be expected to have a v^hat value at least as small
as this, while 31% of SMC lenses would be expected to have v^hat as large as
this. This implies that the lensing system is more likely to reside in the SMC
than in the Galactic halo.

effects of seeing on the light-curves. We have determined that seeing itself
can be responsible for correlated 5% variations in the light-curves of A and B.
We have found, however, that these effects can be accurately removed, by
subtracting the light from the lens galaxy, and by correcting for cross
contamination of light between the closely juxtaposed A and B images. We find
that these corrections improve the variations due to seeing from 5% to a level

parameters of individual lenses are obtained from the Einstein timescales.
However, the nature of MACHOs is still very uncertain despite the large number
of detected events. This uncertainty is mainly due to the degeneracy of the
lens parameters in the measured Einstein timescales. The degeneracy can be
lifted in a general fashion if the angular Einstein ring radius $\theta_{\rm
E}$, and thus the MACHO proper motion, can be measured by conducting accurate
astrometric measurements of centroid displacement in the source star image.
  In this paper, we analyze the influence of bright lenses on the astrometric
measurements of the centroid displacement and investigate this effect on the
determination of $\theta_{\rm E}$. We find that if an event is caused by a
bright lens, the centroid displacement is distorted by the flux of the lens and
resulting astrometric ellipse becomes rounder and smaller with increasing lens
brightness, causing an incorrect determination of the angular Einstein ring
radius. A lens-blended event cannot be distinguished from a dark lens event
from the trajectory of the measured centroid displacements alone because both
events have elliptical trajectories: the degeneracy between dark and bright
lens events. We also find that even with information from the analysis of the
light curve of the event it will still be difficult to resolve the degeneracy
caused by the bright lens because the light curve is also affected by lens
blending.

Efron and Petrosian (1998). We use matter dominated cosmological models with
either zero cosmological constant or zero spatial curvature. Of the two most
common models of luminosity evolution, L = exp(k t(z)) and L = (1+z)^k', we
find the second model to be a better description of the data at all
luminosities; we find k' = 2.58 ([2.14,2.91] one sigma region) for the Einstein
- de Sitter model.
  Using this form of luminosity evolution we determine a global luminosity
function and the evolution of the co-moving density for the two types of
cosmological models. For the Einstein - de Sitter cosmological model we find a
relatively strong increase in co-moving density up to a redshift of about 2, at
which point the density peaks and begins to decrease rapidly. This is in
agreement with results from high redshift surveys. We find some co-moving
density evolution for all cosmological models, with the rate of evolution lower
for models with lower matter density. We find that the local cumulative
luminosity function exhibits the usual double power law behavior. The
luminosity density (i.e. the total rate of energy output of quasars) is found
to increase rapidly at low redshift and to peak at around z = 2. Our results
for the luminosity density are compared to results from high redshift surveys

mapped with the JCMT in 12CO(2-1) at 21 arcsec resolution, with detections out
to at least 36 arcsec (12 kpc). Within the limits of the resolution and
coverage, the distribution of gas appears to be roughly E-W, consistent with
previous observations of CO, X-ray, H alpha, and dust emission. The total
detected molecular hydrogen mass is ~ 1.6 x 10^10 solar masses, using a
Galactic conversion factor. The inner central rotating disk is apparent in the
data, but the overall distribution is not one of rotation. Rather, the line
profiles are bluewards asymmetric, consistent with previous observations in HI
and [OIII]. We suggest that the blueshift may be due to an acquired mean
velocity of ~ 150 km/sec imparted by the radio jet in the advancing direction.
Within the uncertainties of the analysis, the available radio energy appears to
be sufficient, and the interpretation is consistent with that of Bohringer et
al. (1993) for displaced X-ray emission. We have also made the first
observations of 13CO(2-1) and 12CO(3-2) emission from the central 21 arcsec
region of NGC 1275 and combined these data with IRAM data supplied by Reuter et
al. (1993) to form line ratios over equivalent, well-sampled regions. An LVG
radiative transfer analysis indicates that the line ratios are not well
reproduced by a single value of kinetic temperature, molecular hydrogen
density, and abundance per unit velocity gradient. At least two temperatures
are suggested by a simple two-component LVG model, possibly reflecting a
temperature gradient in this region.

  versus linear decays","7 pages latex, 6 figures, Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01991.x",,"astro-ph",,"  A recent paper by King and Ritter (1998: hereafter KR) proposed that the
light curves of soft X-ray transients (SXTs) are dominated by the effect of
irradiation of the accretion disc by the central X-rays. This prevents the
onset of the cooling wave which would otherwise return the disc to the
quiescent state, and so prolongs the outbursts beyond those in dwarf nova
discs. KR show that the decay of the resulting X-ray light curve should be
exponential or linear depending on whether or not the observed peak X-ray
luminosity is sufficient to ionize the outer edge of the accretion disc. Here
we examine the observed X-ray decays, and show that they are exponential or
linear according as the peak luminosity is greater or smaller than the critical
value defined by KR, strongly suggesting that the light curves are indeed
irradiation--dominated. We show further that the occurrence of an exponential
or linear decay tends to favour the same type of decay in subsequent outbursts,
so that systems usually show only one or the other type. We use the equations
of KR and the observed X-ray light curve to determine the size $R_{h}$ of the
hot disc at the peak of the outburst. For exponential decays, $R_{h}$ is found
to be comparable to the circularization radius, as expected since the disc
consists entirely of material transferred from the secondary since the previous
outburst. Further, $R_h$ is directly proportional to the time at which one sees
the secondary maximum ($t_{s}$), as expected if $t_{s}$ is the viscous
timescale of the irradiated disc. This implies that the orders of magnitude of
the viscosity parameter alpha and disc aspect ratio H/R are such that alpha
(H/R)~0.01. Observation of a secondary maximum calibrates the peak luminosity
and gives an eqaution for the distance to the source.

oscillatory motions of the scales of the universe whenever the orbit visits the
neighborhood of the saddle-center, before the universe enters a period of
exponential expansion. The oscillations of the scale functions produce, by a
resonance mechanism, the amplification of a selected wave number spectrum of
density perturbations, and can explain the hierarchy of scales observed in the
actual universe. The transversal crossings of the homoclinic cylinders induce
chaos in the dynamics of the model, a fact intimately connected to the
resonance mechanism occuring immediately before the exit to inflation.

Only one irreducible two-loop integral enters, and this vanishes. All other
corrections in the heavy-baryon limit can be absorbed in the physical

there are no contributions at fifth order. Including finite nucleon mass

results prove the existence of hybrid baryons made up of heavy quarks in the

using a duality of large N gauge theories with string theory on a certain

infinitely many vacua that are stable in the large N limit. The true vacuum,
found by minimizing the energy in this family, is a smooth function of theta
except at theta equal to pi, where it jumps. This jump is associated with
spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry. Domain walls separating adjacent vacua are

of phase transitions in field theory. We derive an exact renormalization group

We develop different approximation methods to solve that equation, and we
obtain non perturbative improvements to the effective potential for a self

relativity as an effective low energy theory. We include the effect of scalar
fields, fermions and gravitons. The inclusion of metric fluctuations causes
Einstein semiclassical equations to depend on the gauge fixing parameters, and
they are therefore non physical. We solve this problem identifying as a

$U$, with the effect that nonlinear interaction between modes corresponding to
length scales smaller than $\alpha$ is negligible. We generalize this equation
to the setting of an $n$ dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. The resulting
equation is the Euler-Poincar\'{e} equation associated with the geodesic flow
of the $H^1$ right invariant metric on ${\mathcal D}^s_\mu$, the group of
volume preserving Hilbert diffeomorphisms of class $H^s$. We prove that the
geodesic spray is continuously differentiable from $T{\mathcal D}_\mu^s(M)$
into $TT{\mathcal D}_\mu^s(M)$ so that a standard Picard iteration argument
proves existence and uniqueness on a finite time interval. Our goal in this
paper is to establish the foundations for Lagrangian stability analysis
following Arnold [1966]. To do so, we use submanifold geometry, and prove that
the weak curvature tensor of the right invariant $H^1$ metric on ${\mathcal

follows that solutions to Jacobi's equation exist. Using such solutions, we are
able to study the infinitesimal stability behavior of geodesics.

obtained by taking the derivative of an action function, and use this structure
to prove covariant generalizations of conservation of symplecticity and
Noether's theorem. Natural discretization schemes for PDEs, which have these
important preservation properties, then follow by choosing a discrete action
functional. In the case of mechanics, we recover the variational symplectic
integrators of Veselov type, while for PDEs we obtain covariant spacetime
integrators which conserve the corresponding discrete multisymplectic form as
well as the discrete momentum mappings corresponding to symmetries. We show
that the usual notion of symplecticity along an infinite-dimensional space of
fields can be naturally obtained by making a spacetime split. All of the
aspects of our method are demonstrated with a nonlinear sine-Gordon equation,
including computational results and a comparison with other discretization

the curvature of the magnetic field lines. We conclude, that in the pulsar

Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto and at California State University in
Long Beach to develop and test a recently published theory that Newton's
equation of motion can be derived from Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics
as applied to the zero-point field (ZPF) of the quantum vacuum. In this
ZPF-inertia theory, mass is postulated to be not an intrinsic property of
matter but rather a kind of electromagnetic drag force that proves to be
acceleration dependent by virtue of the spectral characteristics of the ZPF.
The theory proposes that interactions between the ZPF and matter take place at
the level of quarks and electrons, hence would account for the mass of a
composite neutral particle such as the neutron. An effort to generalize the
exploratory study of Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff (1994) into a proper
relativistic formulation has been successful. Moreover the principle of
equivalence implies that in this view gravitation would also be electromagnetic
in origin along the lines proposed by Sakharov (1968). With regard to exotic
propulsion we can definitively rule out one speculatively hypothesized
mechanism: matter possessing negative inertial mass, a concept originated by
Bondi (1957) is shown to be logically impossible. On the other hand, the linked
ZPF-inertia and ZPF-gravity concepts open the conceptual possibility of
manipulation of inertia and gravitation, since both are postulated to be
electromagnetic phenomena. It is hoped that this will someday translate into
actual technological potential. A key question is whether the proposed
ZPF-matter interactions generating the phenomenon of mass might involve one or
more resonances. This is presently under investigation.

analysis is based on the assumption that the energy variation of the test
particle is much less than its kinetic energy. The obtained general expression
for stopping power is analyzed for three cases: (i) the particle moves through
a collisionless plasma in a strong homogeneous magnetic field; (ii) the fast
particle moves through a magnetized collisionless plasma along the magnetic
field; and (iii) the particle moves through a magnetized collisional plasma
across a magnetic field. Calculations are carried out for the arbitrary test
