of the process of speciation as a consequence of genetic divergence. In this
metaphor, biological populations diverge along connected clusters of well-fit
genotypes in a multidimensional adaptive landscape and become reproductively
isolated species when they come to be on opposite sides of a ``hole'' in the
adaptive landscape. No crossing of any adaptive valleys is required. I
formulate and study a series of simple models describing the dynamics of
speciation on holey adaptive landscapes driven by mutation and random genetic
drift. Unlike most previous models that concentrate only on some stages of
speciation, the models studied here describe the complete process of speciation
from initiation until completion. The evolutionary factors included are
selection (reproductive isolation), random genetic drift, mutation,
recombination, and migration. In these models, pre- and post-mating
reproductive isolation is a consequence of cumulative genetic change. I study
possibilities for speciation according to allopatric, parapatric, peripatric
and vicariance scenarios. The analytic theory satisfactorily matches results of
individual-based simulations reported by Gavrilets et al. (1998). It is
demonstrated that rapid speciation including simultaneous emergence of several
new species is a plausible outcome of the evolutionary dynamics of subdivided
populations. I consider effects of population size, population subdivision, and
local adaptation on the dynamics of speciation. I briefly discuss some
implications of the dynamics on holey adaptive landscapes for molecular
evolution.

by-product of genetic divergence. Here, individual-based simulations are used
to evaluate whether the mechanisms implied by this view may result in rapid
speciation if the only source of genetic divergence are mutation and random
genetic drift. Distinctive features of the simulations are the consideration of
the complete process of speciation (from initiation until completion), and of a
large number of loci, which was only one order of magnitude smaller than that
of bacteria. It is demonstrated that rapid speciation on the time scale of
hundreds of generations is plausible without the need for extreme founder
events, complete geographic isolation, the existence of distinct adaptive peaks
or selection for local adaptation. The plausibility of speciation is enhanced
by population subdivision. Simultaneous emergence of more than two new species
from a subdivided population is highly probable. Numerical examples relevant to
the theory of centrifugal speciation and to the conjectures about the fate of
``ring species'' and ``sexual continuums'' are presented.

formation rate density, (2) proportional to the total integrated stellar
density and (3) constant. All three models make the assumption that at every
epoch the probability of a GRB occuring in a galaxy is proportional to that
galaxy's broad-band luminosity. No assumption is made that GRBs are standard
candles or even that their luminosity function is narrow. All three rate
density models are consistent with the observed GRB host galaxies to date,
although model (2) is slightly disfavored relative to the others. Models (1)

distributions; these models will be probably not be distinguished without
measurements of host-galaxy star-formation rates. The fraction of host galaxies
fainter than 28 mag may constrain the faint end of the galaxy luminosity
function at high redshift, or, if the fraction is observed to be low, may
suggest that the bursters are expelled from low-luminosity hosts. In all

relation of galaxies in the local universe, taking advantage of the very large
and homogeneous data set available from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey
(Shectman et al. 1996). This data set consists of galaxies inhabiting the
entire range of galactic environments, from the sparsest field to the densest
clusters, thus allowing us to study environmental variations without combining
multiple data sets with inhomogeneous characteristics. Concentration is
quantified by the automatically-measured concentration index $C$, which is a
good measure of a galaxy's bulge-to-disk ratio. The environment of the sample
galaxies is characterized both by the three-space local galaxy density and by
membership in groups and clusters. We find that the distribution of C in galaxy
populations varies both with local density and with cluster/group membership:
the fraction of centrally-concentrated galaxies increases with local galaxy
density, and is higher in clusters than in the field. A comparison of the
concentration-local density relation in clusters and the field shows that the
two connect rather smoothly at the intermediate density regime, implying that
the apparent cluster/field difference is only a manifestation of the variation
with the local density. We conclude that the structure of galaxies is
predominantly influenced by the local density and not by the broader
environments characterized by cluster/field memberships.

the merging histories of dark-matter halos in N-body simulations, focusing on
the joint distribution of the number of progenitors and their masses. We first
confirm that the halo mass function as predicted directly by the
Press-Schechter (PS) model deviates from the simulations by up to 50% depending
on the mass scale and redshift, while the means of the projected distributions
of progenitor number and mass for a halo of a given mass are more accurately
predicted by the Extended PS model. We then use the full merger trees to study
the joint distribution as a function of redshift and parent-halo mass. We find
that while the deviation of the mean quantities due to the inaccuracy of the
Extended PS model partly propagates into the higher moments of the
distribution, the merger-tree procedure does not introduce a significant
additional source of error. In particular, certain properties of the merging
history such as the mass ratio of the progenitors and the total accretion rate
are reproduced quite accurately for galaxy sized halos ($\sim 10^{12}\msun$),
and less so for larger masses. We conclude that although there could be $\sim
50%$ deviations in the absolute numbers and masses of progenitors and in the
higher order moment of these distributions, the relative properties of
progenitors for a given halo are reproduced fairly well by the merger trees.
They can thus provide a useful framework for modelling galaxy formation once
the above-mentioned limitations are taken into account.

X-1 taken after it transited back to this state from its soft/high state.
RXTE's large effective area, superior timing capabilities, and ability to
obtain long, uninterrupted observations have allowed us to obtain measurements
of the power spectral density (PSD), coherence function, and Fourier time lags
to a decade lower in frequency and half a decade higher in frequency than
typically was achieved with previous instruments. Notable aspects of our
observations include a weak 0.005 Hz feature in the PSD coincident with a
coherence recovery; a `hardening' of the high-frequency PSD with increasing
energy; a broad frequency range measurement of the coherence function,
revealing rollovers from unity coherence at both low and high frequency; and an
accurate determination of the Fourier time lags over two and a half decades in
frequency. As has been noted in previous similar observations, the time delay
is approximately proportional to f^(-0.7), and at a fixed Fourier frequency the
time delay of the hard X-rays compared to the softest energy channel tends to
increase logarithmically with energy. Curiously, the 0.01-0.2 Hz coherence
between the highest and lowest energy bands is actually slightly greater than
the coherence between the second highest and lowest energy bands. We carefully
describe all of the analysis techniques used in this paper, and we make
comparisons of the data to general theoretical expectations. In a companion
paper, we make specific comparisons to a Compton corona model that we have
successfully used to describe the energy spectral data from this observation.

sinusoidal field. For this type of laser, the cavity round-trip time is much
shorter than its fluorescence time, yielding a dimensionless ratio of time
scales $\sigma \ll 1$. Analytical criteria are derived for the existence,
stability, and bifurcations of phase-locked states. We find three distinct
unlocking mechanisms. First, if the dimensionless detuning $\Delta$ and
injection strength $k$ are small in the sense that $k = O(\Delta) \ll
\sigma^{1/2}$, unlocking occurs by a saddle-node infinite-period bifurcation.
This is the classic unlocking mechanism governed by the Adler equation: after
unlocking occurs, the phases of the drive and the laser drift apart
monotonically. The second mechanism occurs if the detuning and the drive
strength are large: $k =O(\Delta) \gg \sigma^{1/2}$. In this regime, unlocking
is caused instead by a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, leading first to phase
trapping and only then to phase drift as the drive is decreased. The third and
most interesting mechanism occurs in the distinguished intermediate regime $k,
\Delta = O(\sigma^{1/2})$. Here the system exhibits complicated, but
nonchaotic, behavior. Furthermore, as the drive decreases below the unlocking
threshold, numerical simulations predict a novel self-similar sequence of
bifurcations whose details are not yet understood.

thickness to converge dynamically to a value close to l_{min} where growth with

the two dominant theoretical approaches. However, at small supercoolings the
rounding of the crystal profile does inhibit growth as suggested in Sadler and

radiation by solving Maxwell's equations with an additional term that couples
the field to the bubble's motion. We show that, in the static case originally

algebras within Clifford algebras of multivectors. These Clifford algebras
possess a unique gradation and a possibly non-symmetric bilinear form. Hecke
algebra representations can be classified, for non-generic q, by Young tableaux
of the symmetric group due to the isomorphy of the group algebras for q ->1.
Since spinors can be constructed as elements of minimal left (right) ideals
obtained by the left (right) action on primitive idempotents, we are able to
construct q-spinors from q-Young operators corresponding to the appropriate
symmetry type. It turns out that an anti-symmetric part in the Clifford
bilinear form is necessary. q-deformed reflections (Hecke generators) can be
obtained only for even multivector aggregates rendering this symmetry a
composite one. In this construction one is able to deform spin groups only,
though not pin groups. The method is closely related to a projective
interpretation.

adiabatically couples trapped and untrapped internal atomic states for atoms

The starting point is the Markovian stochastic wave function description of an

harmonic oscillators in arbitrary pure or mixed states. It is shown that matrix
elements of reduced Heisenberg picture operators and general time-ordered
correlation functions can be expressed by time-symmetric expectation values of
extended operators in a doubled Hilbert space. This representation allows the
construction of a stochastic process in the doubled Hilbert space which enables
the determination of arbitrary matrix elements and correlation functions. The
numerical efficiency of the resulting stochastic simulation algorithm is
investigated and compared with an alternative Monte Carlo wave function method
proposed first by Dalibard et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 68}, 580 (1992)]. By
means of a standard example the suggested algorithm is shown to be more
efficient numerically and to converge faster. Finally, some specific examples
from quantum optics are presented in order to illustrate the proposed method,
such as the coupling of a system to a vacuum, a squeezed vacuum within a finite
