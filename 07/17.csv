In this model, each individual artificial neuron is an autonomous unit whose

concentrations of substrates modeled by a simple artificial chemistry. Gene
expression is manifested as axon and dendrite growth, cell division and
differentiation, substrate production and cell stimulation. We demonstrate the
model's power with a hand-written genome that leads to the growth of a simple

in He II 304 \AA images is an emission limb. We find: (1) the limb is higher at
the poles than at the equator both in the coronal images (by 1300 $\pm$ 650 km)

suggest that the elevation of the 304 \AA limb above the limb in the coronal

possibly because of the presence of spicules. The polar extension is consistent
with a reduced heat input to the chromosphere in the polar coronal holes

insensitive to the cosmological model but depend on our assumption that the UV
background declines at low redshift. We find that the expansion of the universe
drives rapid evolution of dN/dz (the number of absorbers per unit z) at z >
1.7, but that at lower redshift the fading of the UV background counters the
influence of expansion, leading to slow evolution. At every redshift, weaker
lines come primarily from moderate fluctuations of the diffuse, unshocked IGM,
and stronger lines originate in shocked or radiatively cooled gas of higher
overdensity. However, the neutral hydrogen column density associated with
structures of fixed overdensity drops as the universe expands, so an absorber
at z = 0 is dynamically analogous to an absorber with neutral hydrogen column
density 10 to 50 times higher at z = 2-3. We find no clear distinction between
lines arising in ""galaxy halos"" and lines arising in larger scale structures;
however, galaxies tend to lie near the dense regions of the IGM that produce
strong Lyman alpha lines. The simulations provide a unified physical picture
that accounts for the most distinctive observed properties of the low redshift
Lyman alpha forest: (1) a sharp transition in the evolution of dN/dz at z ~
1.7, (2) stronger evolution for absorbers of higher equivalent width, (3) a
correlation of increasing Lyman alpha equivalent width with decreasing galaxy
impact parameter, and (4) a tendency for stronger lines to arise in close
proximity to galaxies while weaker lines trace more diffuse large scale
structure. (Abridged)

neutron star efficiently maintain the core at a temperature >5e7 K. When
accretion halts, the envelope relaxes to a thermal equilibrium set by the flux
from the hot core, as if the neutron star were newly born. For the
time-averaged accretion rates typical of low-mass X-ray transients, standard
neutrino cooling is unimportant and the core thermally re-radiates the
deposited heat. The resulting luminosity has the same magnitude as that
observed from several transient neutron stars in quiescence. Confirmation of
this mechanism would strongly constrain rapid neutrino cooling mechanisms for
neutron stars. Thermal emission had previously been dismissed as a predominant
source of quiescent emission since blackbody spectral fits implied an emitting
area much smaller than a neutron star's surface. However, as with thermal
emission from radio pulsars, fits with realistic emergent spectra will imply a
substantially larger emitting area. Other emission mechanisms, such as
accretion or a pulsar shock, can also operate in quiescence and generate
intensity and spectral variations over short timescales. Indeed, quiescent
accretion may produce gravitationally redshifted metal photoionization edges in
the quiescent spectra (detectable with AXAF and XMM). We discuss past
observations of Aql~X-1 and note that the low luminosity X-ray sources in
globular clusters and the Be star/X-ray transients are excellent candidates for
future study.

with optical data from the MMT and the Steward Observatory 2.3m telescope.
These spectra give continuous wavelength coverage from 1200 to 8000 Angstroms,
corresponding to 340 to 2480 Angstroms in the QSO rest frame. This object
therefore offers a rare opportunity to study broad absorption lines in the
rest-frame extreme UV. We find that the absorption system is dominated by very
high-ionization species, including O VI, NeVIII, and SiXII. We also identify
apparently saturated broad Lyman-series lines of order Ly-gamma and higher.
There is strong evidence for partial occultation of the QSO emission source,
particularly from the higher-order Lyman lines which indicate a covered
fraction less than 0.2. Overall, the data suggest a correlation between a
larger covered fraction and a higher state of ionization. We suggest that the
different covered fractions can be explained by either a special line of sight
through a disk-like geometry or by the existence of density fluctuations of a
factor >2 in the BAL gas. Our photoionization models of the system indicate a
large column density and high ionization state similar to that found in X-ray

via the Lyapunov exponent and the collisional damping via the relaxation time.
The former is calculated for different shape deformations of quadrupole and
octupole type. The surface as well as the collisional contribution each
reproduce almost the experimental value, therefore we propose a proper
weighting between both contributions related to their relative occurrence due
to collision frequencies between particles and of particles with the surface.

dominates whereas the surface damping is dominant around the temperatures

The size of ALS is comparable to SLS. The channel dependence of ALS, which is

and/or the meson exchange interaction are used, deviates after introducing III.
In most of the two-baryon channels, including the two-nucleon channel, the

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism for nonlinear partial differential
equations.
  In this theory, solutions of a PDE are sections of a fiber bundle $Y$ over a
base manifold $X$ of dimension $n$$+$1, typically taken to be spacetime. Given
a connection on $Y$, a covariant Hamiltonian density ${\mathcal H}$ is then
intrinsically defined on the primary constraint manifold $P_{\mathcal L}$, the
image of the multisymplectic version of the Legendre transformation. One views
$P_{\mathcal L}$ as a subbundle of $J^1(Y)^\star$, the affine dual of $J^1(Y)$,
the first jet bundle of $Y$. A canonical multisymplectic ($n$$+$2)-form
$\Omega_{\mathcal H}$ is then defined, from which we obtain a multisymplectic
Hamiltonian system of differential equations that is equivalent to both the
original PDE as well as the Euler-Lagrange equations of the corresponding
Lagrangian. We show that the $n$$+$1 2-forms $\omega^{(\mu)}$ defined by
Bridges [1997] are a particular coordinate representation for a single
multisymplectic ($n$$+$2)-form, and in the presence of symmetries, can be
assembled into $\Omega_{\mathcal H}$. A generalized Hamiltonian Noether theory
is then constructed which recovers the vanishing of the divergence of the
vector of $n$$+$1 distinct momentum mappings defined in Bridges [1997] and,
when applied to water waves, recovers Whitham's conservation of wave action. We
also show the utility of this theory in the study of periodic pattern formation

  publication in the Proceedings of the AMS with the PAMS style file proc-l.cls","Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 129 (2001), 257-264",,,"math.GT math.SG",,"  An interesting question in symplectic topology, which was posed by C. H.
Taubes, concerns the topology of closed (i.e. compact and without boundary)
connected oriented three dimensional manifolds whose product with a circle
admits a symplectic structure. The only known examples of such manifolds are
those which fiber over a circle. Taubes asked whether these examples are the
only examples of such manifolds. An affirmative answer to Taubes' question
would have the following consequence: any such manifold either is diffeomorphic
to the product of a two-sphere with a circle or is irreducible and aspherical.
In this paper, we prove that this implication holds up to connect sum with a
manifold which admits no proper covering spaces with finite index. It is
pointed out that Thurston's geometrization conjecture and known results in the
theory of three dimensional manifolds imply that such a manifold is a
three-dimensional sphere. Hence, modulo the present conjectural picture of
three-dimensional manifolds, we have shown that the stated consequence of an
affirmative answer to Taubes' question holds.

finite width of test-particles as used in numerical implementations. It is
shown that this coarse grained distribution obeys a kinetic equation similar to
the Vlasov equation, but with additional terms. These terms give rise to
entropy production indicating dissipative features due to a nonlinear mode
coupling The interchange of coarse graining and dynamical evolution is
discussed with the help of an exactly solvable model for the selfconsistent
Vlasov equation and practical consequences are worked out. By calculating
analytically the stationary solution of a general Vlasov equation we can show
that a sum of modified Boltzmann-like distributions is approached dependent on
the initial distribution. This behavior is independent of degeneracy and only
controlled by the width of test-particles. The condition for approaching a
stationary solution is derived and it is found that the coarse graining energy
given by the momentum width of test particles should be smaller than a quarter
of the kinetic energy. Observable consequences of this coarse graining are: (i)
spatial correlations in observables, (ii) too large radii of clusters or nuclei
in self-consistent Thomas-Fermi treatments, (iii) a structure term in the
response function resembling vertex correction correlations or internal
structure effects and (iv) a modified centroid energy and higher damping width
of collective modes.

finite duration of collisions. The formation of correlations and the build up
time is calculated analytically for the high temperature and the low
temperature limit. This translates into a time dependent increase of the
effective temperature on time scales which interfere with standard fire ball
scenarios of heavy ion collisions. The consequences of the formation of
correlations on the two- particle interferometry are investigated and it is
found that standard extracted lifetimes should be corrected downwards.

locality contains an implicit form of realism, since in a world view that

independent of measurement. Hence we argue that response (i) is incomplete, in
that its rejection of realism is only partial.

natural ``baker covering map'' on the plane $\QTO{mathbb}{\mathbb{R}}^{2}$. We
then use as the quantum algebra of observables the subalgebra of operators on
$L^{2}(\QTO{mathbb}{\mathbb{R}}) $ generated by $\left\{\exp (2\pi i\hat{x})
,\exp (2\pi i\hat{p}) \right\} $ . We construct a unitary propagator such that
as $\hbar \to 0$ the classical dynamics is returned. For Planck's constant
$h=1/N$, we show that the dynamics can be reduced to the dynamics on an
$N$-dimensional Hilbert space, and the unitary $N\times N$ matrix propagator is
the same as given in ref. \QCITE{cite}{}{BV} except for a small correction of
order $h$. This correction is shown to preserve the classical symmetry $x\to
