broad band X-ray spectra of 6 galaxy clusters with radio halos (A401, A754,
A1367, Coma (A1656), A2256, and A2319). The 0.7 - 10 keV spectra for all
clusters were obtained with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astrophysics (ASCA) Gas Imaging Spectrometer (GIS). For A401, A754, A1367, and
A1656, data from the HEAO1-A2 High Energy Detector (HED) (2-60 keV) was
included in a joint fit to further constrain the allowed non-thermal component.
Upperlimits to the non-thermal X-ray emission are a factor of approximately 10
improvement over previous values. Lower limits to the average magnetic field
derived from these upperlimits and the radio spectral parameters range from
0.08 - 0.30 microGauss. A seed intracluster field amplified by turbulence from
galaxy motion through the intracluster medium should have an average value in
the range of 0.1-0.2 (Goldman & Rephaeli, 1991; De Young, 1992), thus the lack
of any detections makes it unlikely that field amplification is due to galaxy
wakes. In addition, all of these clusters have an asymmetric surface brightness
distribution while several also have X-ray spectroscopic evidence of a merger.
We suggest that cluster mergers rather than galaxy wakes are the source of the
magnetic field amplification.

GRBs produced by SNe (``S-GRBs''). Robust arguments for the existence of a
relativistic shock have been presented on the basis of radio observations. A
physical model based on the radio observations lead us to propose the following
characteristics of supernovae GRBs (S-GRBs): 1) prompt radio emission and
implied brightness temperature near or below the inverse Compton limit, 2) high
expansion velocity of the optical photosphere as derived from lines widths and
energy release larger than usual, 3) no long-lived X-ray afterglow, and 4) a
single pulse (SP) GRB profile. Radio studies of previous SNe show that only
type Ib and Ic potentially satisfy the first condition. Accordingly we have
investigated proposed associations of GRBs and SNe finding no convincing
evidence (mainly to paucity of data) to confirm any single connection of a SN
with a GRB. If there is a more constraining physical basis for the burst
time-history of S-GRBs beyond that of the SP requirement, we suggest the 1% of
light curves in the BATSE catalogue similar to that of GRB 980425 may
constitute the subclass. Future optical follow-up of bursts with similar
profiles should confirm if such GRBs originate from some fraction of SN type
Ib/Ic.

S-shaped structure with radial extent ~ 20 pc, including a bar-like central
elongation at P.A. ~ 15 deg and two short spiral arms. The K core is at the
location of the putative central engine (radio source S1) : the core is likely
the emission from the hot inner walls of the dust/molecular torus. The
extremely red colors of the central 0.2"", [J-K]=7.0, [H-K]=3.8, lead to an
extinction Av > 25. The elongated structure at P.A.~ 102 deg may trace the
presence of cooler dust within and around the torus. This interpretation is
supported by two facts : a) the elongated structure is perpendicular to the
local radio jet originating at S1; b) its direction follows exactly that of the
disk of ionized gas recently found with the VLBA. The S-shaped feature suggests
an extremely compact barred spiral structure, that would be the innermost of a
series of nested spiral structures, as predicted by simulations. This is
supported by the inner stellar distribution - deduced from the J image - which
clearly follows an exponential disk with a 19 pc scale-length, precisely that
expected from the rotation of a bar.

short ranged interaction between monomer pairs $(i,j)$, proportional to
$(\lambda_i+\lambda_j)$. In this article, we take $\lambda_i=+1$ (resp.

chain with (i) an equal number of hydro-philic and -phobic monomers (ii) a
periodic distribution of the $\lambda_{i}$ along the chain, with periodicity

For $p >p_c$, the ground state corresponds to a macroscopic phase separation
between a dense hydrophobic core and hydrophilic loops. For $p <p_c$ (but not
too small), one gets a microscopic (finite scale) phase separation, and the
ground state corresponds to a chain or network of hydrophobic droplets, coated
by hydrophilic monomers. We restrict our study to two extreme cases, $p \sim

negative differential conductance due to the presence of mid-gap states. We
study how robust these features are to finite temperature and also comment on
how the calculated current-voltage curves compare with experiments. For some
other configurations (for small barrier strength) we find zero-bias conductance
peaks due to multiple Andreev reflections through midgap states. Moreover, the
odd ac components are strongly suppressed and even absent in some arrangements.
This absence will lead to a doubling of the Josephson frequency. All these
features are due to the d-wave order parameter changing sign when rotated
$90^{\circ}$. Recently, there have been several theoretical reports on parallel
current in the d-wave case for both the stationary Josephson junction and for
the normal metal-superconductor junction. Also in our case there may appear
current density parallel to the junction, and we present a few examples when

continuous, or coupled reaction-diffusion approach, in which continuous time
evolution equations describe the bacterial density and the concentration of the
relevant chemical fields. In the context of branching growth, this idea has
been pursued by a number of groups. We present an additional model which
includes a lubrication fluid excreted by the bacteria. We also add fields of

intricate network of synaptic connections that are generated during the system
development. During the network formation, the growth cones migrate through the
embryonic environment to their targets using chemical communication. A major
obstacle in the elucidation of fundamental principles underlying this
self-wiring is the complexity of the system being analyzed. Hence much effort
is devoted to in-vitro experiments of simpler 2D model systems. In these
experiments neurons are placed on Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) surfaces so it is easier
to monitor their self-wiring. We developed a model to reproduce the salient
features of the 2D systems, inspired by the study of bacterial colony's growth
and the aggregation of amoebae. We represent the neurons (each composed of
cell's soma, neurites and growth cones) by active elements that capture the
generic features of the real neurons. The model also incorporates stationary
units representing the cells' soma and communicating walkers representing the
growth cones. The stationary units send neurites one at a time, and respond to
chemical signaling. The walkers migrate in response to chemotaxis substances
emitted by the soma and communicate with each other and with the soma by means
of chemotactic ``feedback''. The interplay between the chemo-repulsive and
chemo-attractive responses is determined by the dynamics of the walker's
internal energy which is controlled by the soma. These features enable the
neurons to perform the complex task of self-wiring.

k_T-range. In central Au+Au collisions at \sqrt{s}=200A GeV, and in the range 2
GeV < k_T < 4 GeV, the inverse slope of the thermal radiation is 360-460 MeV,
while that of the QCD photons is 500-1000 MeV. This large difference might
allow to disentangle the various sources of direct photons experimentally. At
\sqrt{s}=5.5A TeV, nuclear shadowing and quark-jet quenching suppresses the
QCD-photons strongly for k_T<5 GeV. Thermal radiation dominates in this
k_T-region.

used to construct ``sine-Gordon'' coordinates for a black hole of mass M, and
construct the transformation to more standard ``Schwarzchild-like''
coordinates. For N=1 and 2, we find explicit closed form solutions to the
dilaton equations of motion in soliton coordinates, and find the relationship
between the soliton parameters and the black hole mass. Remarkably, the black
hole mass is non-negative for arbitrary soliton parameters. In the one-soliton
case the coordinates are shown to cover smoothly a region containing the whole
interior of the black hole as well as a finite neighbourhood outside the
horizon. A Hamiltonian analysis is performed for slicings that approach the
soliton coordinates on the interior, and it is shown that there is no boundary
contribution from the interior. Finally we speculate on the sine-Gordon
solitonic origin of black hole statistical mechanics.

the high energy limit of the total n+d cross section is evaluated in a

naive expectation that the total n+d scattering cross section is the sum of two
NN cross sections we find two additional effects resulting from rescattering
processes. These additional terms have different signs (shadowing and
antishadowing) and a different behavior as function of the energy. Our
derivation of these results which are already known from Glauber theory is
based on the analytical evaluation of elastic transition amplitudes in the high
energy limit. It does not depend on the diffraction type assumptions connected
with Glauber theory. In this model of spinless Yukawa type forces (with no
absorption) the total n+d cross section does not approach twice the NN total
cross section in the high energy limit but rather approaches the total NN cross
section multiplied by a number larger than two. Therefore, the enhancement
effect resulting from rescattering is larger than the shadowing effect, which
decreases faster with energy.

combinations of a finite number of Boolean arrays, whose components are either

and sufficient for the existence of local objective variables. It leads to a
simple graphical method which produces a large number of generalized Clauser-
Horne inequalities corresponding to the faces of a convex polytope. It is
plausible that quantum systems whose density matrix has a positive partial
transposition satisfy all these inequalities, and therefore are compatible with
local objective variables, even if their quantum properties are essentially
nonlocal.
