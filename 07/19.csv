r-modes is much larger than the previously studied `classical' r-modes. In
particular, for each l and m we find l-m (or l-1 for the m=0 case) distinct
r-modes. Many of these previously unstudied r-modes (about 30% of those
examined) are subject to a secular instability driven by gravitational
radiation. The eigenfunctions of the `classical' r-modes, the l=m+1 case here,
are found to have particularly simple analytical representations. These r-modes
provide an interesting mathematical example of solutions to a hyperbolic
