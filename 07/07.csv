observed in the near infrared below 1 \mic. Furthermore, we assemble a

core, is expected to contribute to the origination of a number of isotopes both
of light chemical elements and heavy ones. It is shown that, in general, the
heating of stellar matter due to the neutrino scattering off electrons and the
heat released from the neutrino-helium breakup followed by the thermonuclear
reactions should be taken into account. On the base of kinetic network, using
all the important reactions up to Z=8, the main features and the time-dependent
character of the neutrino- driven neutron flux are investigated. The
time-dependent densities of free neutrons produced in helium breakup, Y_n(t),
were used to calculate the r-process nucleosynthesis with another full kinetic
network for 3200 nuclides. It was found that in the case of metal-deficient
stars, Z < 0.01 Z(solar), the resulting density of free neutrons seems to be
high enough to drive the r-process efficiently under favorable conditions. But
it is impossible to obtain a sufficient amount of heavy nuclei in
neutrino-induced r-process in a helium shell at radii R > R_cr \approx 10^9 cm.
We speculate that to make the neutrino-induced r-process work efficiently in
the shell, one has to invoke nonstandard presupernova models in which helium
hopefully is closer to the collapsed core owing, for instance, to a large scale
mixing or/and rotation and magnetic fields. Apart from this exotic possibility,
the neutrino-induced nucleosynthesis in the helium shell is certainly not
strong enough to explain the observed solar r-process abundances.

velocity is -54.9 +/- 0.12 km/s and the dispersion is 0.86 km/s, from 50
constant-velocity stars selected as members from this radial-velocity study and
the proper motion study of McNamara and Solomon (1981). Twenty-five stars (32%)
among 78 members are possible radial-velocity variable stars, but no orbits are
determined because of the sparse sampling. Seventeen stars are radial-velocity
non-members, while membership estimates of six stars are uncertain.
  There is a hint that the observed velocity dispersion falls off at large
radius. This may due to the inclusion of long-period binaries preferentially in
the central area of the cluster. The known radial-velocity variables also seem
to be more concentrated toward the center than members with constant velocity.
Although this is significant at only the 85% level, when combined with similar
result of Raboud and Mermilliod (1994) for three other clusters, the data
strongly support the conclusion that mass segregation is being detected.

agree well with previously published results in showing the need for a separate

the predictions of a simple model in which this component arises through
absorptive dichroism due to aligned grains within the extended warm (~400K)
dust fits the data reasonably if the obscured background source is itself due
to dust emission (at temperature >1000K). By considering the change of
polarisation with wavelength we show that the extinction to this hot dust
region is in the range AV=20-40. Consideration of the observed data then leads
us to the conclusion that if viewed face-on, NGC1068 would have a strong
near-infrared excess similar to Seyfert 1 galaxies. Comparison with other
independent measures of the extinction to the active nucleus itself lead us to
the conclusion that the hot dust must provide screening equivalent to at least
AV=40, and possibly much higher. We speculate that this component alone may be
the `classical' torus discussed in terms of the unified model, and the more
extensive mid-infrared emission may arise from circumnuclear molecular cloud
material, and dust in the ionisation cones.

Hydrodynamics (SPH) code (Monaghan J.J. 1992, ARAA, 30, 543) is noticeably

ideas into the algorithmic inclusion of Star Formation (SF) and Super Novae
(SN) explosions in SPH (Berczik P. & Kravchuk S.G., 1996, ApSpSci, 245, 27).
The proposed energy criterion for definition of a place and efficiency of SF
results in the successfully explain Star Formation History (SFH) in isolated
galaxies of different types. On the base of original ideas we expand a code in
a more realistic way of the description of effects of return of a hot, chemical
enriched gas in Interstellar Matter (ISM). In addition to the account of SNII,
we offer the self-agreed account of SNIa and PN. This allows to describe not
only the ISM content of $ O^{16} $ but also the content of $ Fe^{56} $. This
model will allow to investigate adequately also a well known $ G - dwarf $
problem. In the frame of this approach we are able to reproduce the presently
observed kinematics of star and gaseous components as well as their
distributions and heavy element abundances. The developed model provide the
realistic description of dynamics and chemical evolution of typical disk --

Ic) because its spectra are dominated by broad absorption lines of oxygen and
iron, lacking any clear signs of hydrogen or helium line features. The light
curve is very different from that of previously known SNe Ic, showing a very
broad peak and a slow tail. The strikingly broad line features in the spectra
of SN 1997ef, which were also seen in the hypernova SN 1998bw, suggest the
interesting possibility that SN 1997ef may also be a hypernova. The light curve
and spectra of SN 1997ef were modeled first with a standard SN~Ic model
assuming an ordinary kinetic energy of explosion $E_{\rm K} = 10^{51}$ erg. The
explosion of a CO star of mass $M_{\rm CO} \approx 6 M_\odot$ gives a
reasonably good fit to the light curve but clearly fails to reproduce the broad
spectral features. Then, models with larger masses and energies were explored.
Both the light curve and the spectra of SN 1997ef are much better reproduced by
a C+O star model with $E_{\rm K} =$ 8 \e{51} erg and $M_{\rm CO} = 10 M_\odot$.
Therefore, we conclude that SN 1997ef is very likely a hypernova on the basis
of its kinetic energy of explosion. Finally, implications for the deviation
from spherical symmetry are discussed in an effort to improve the light curve
and spectral fits.

brightened by a factor ~4.5 between 1991 and 1993, and has decreased its
luminosity by a factor ~2.0 between 1993 and 1996. FOS spectroscopy extending
from the near UV to the red side of the optical spectrum reveals a strong UV
continuum over the spectrum of the underlying galaxy, along with several
emission lines in both the UV and the optical ranges. In spite of the low
luminosity of the UV continuum of the spike (~3*10^5 Lsolar), the spike is
definitely placed among AGNs by current diagnostics based on the emission line
intensity ratios, being just on the borderline between Seyferts and LINERs.
Line profiles are very broad, and both permitted and forbidden lines are best
modelled with a combination of broad and narrow components, with FWHM of ~3000
km s^-1 and ~700 km s^-1, respectively. This evidence argues for the variable
central spike being produced by a modest accretion event onto a central massive
black hole (BH), with the accreted material having possibly being stripped from

atmospheric-neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande (SuperK) is interpreted to
reflect a new symmetry of the neutrino-oscillation mixing matrix. From that we
obtain an analytical set of constraints yielding a class of mixing matrices of
the property to simultaneously fit both the SuperK and the LSND data. The
resulting mass squared difference relevant for the LSND experiment is found as
0.3 eV^2. The discussed symmetry, e.g., carries the nature that expectation
values of masses for \nu_\mu and \nu_\tau are identical. These considerations
are purely data dictated. A different framework is then applied to the solar
neutrino problem. It is argued that a single sterile neutrino is an unlikely
candidate to accommodate the data from the four solar neutrino experiments. A
scenario is discussed which violates CPT symmetry, and favors the \nu_e -
\bar\nu_e system to belong to the `self'-`anti-self' charge conjugate construct
in the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) representation space, where the needed helicity flipping
amplitudes are preferred, rather than the usual Dirac, or Majorana, constructs.
In the presented framework the emerging SuperK data on solar neutrino flux is
reconciled with the Homestake, GALLEX, and SAGE experiments. This happens
because the former detects not only the solar \nu_e but also, at a lower cross
section, the oscillated solar \bar\nu_e; while the latter are sensitive only to
the oscillation-diminished solar \nu_e flux. A direct observation of solar
\bar\nu_e by SNO will confirm our scenario. Finally, we consider the
possibility for flavor-dependent gravitational couplings of neutrinos as

its less familiar extension to the case of a multi-component inflaton; in both
cases the key ingredient is the separate evolution of causally disconnected
regions of the Universe. Primordial gravitational waves will be an even more

predict that they are completely negligible. We treat in detail the new wave of

Au+Au collisions at 10.8 AGeV incident energy is reviewed. The study of
spectral shapes indicates the presence of collective transverse flow and - in
particular for charged pions - of Coulomb final state interaction between
emitted particles and the nuclear charge distribution. The comparison to SIS
pion data measured with KaoS elucidates the role of charged pions to probe
nuclear reaction dynamics at lower incident energies.

framework are reviewed. The electromagnetic current is truncated to a single
nucleon operator, but the interaction among the three nucleons is treated
exactly. Thus initial and final 3N states are evaluated consistently as
solutions of Faddeev equations based on realistic NN forces. The correct
inclusion of the final state interaction turned out to be important. The
agreement to data is reasonably good, but the neglection of MEC's can be seen.
That inconsistency should be removed. For pd capture processes we included some
MEC's via the Siegert theorem, which dramatically improves the description of
the pd capture data.

antiquark pairs ($Q \bar{Q}$) in heavy ion scattering at high energies (LHC) is
considered. The total and differential cross sections of these processes with
the formation of $c \bar{c}$ and $b \bar{b}$ pairs in $pp$, $CaCa$ and $PbPb$
collisions are evaluated. The contribution of the considered mechanisms is a
few per cent of the number of heavy quark - antiquark pairs obtained in the
processes of hard (QCD) scattering, and it will be taken into account in the
registration of $c$, $b$ quarks or, for instance, in the study of the heavy
quarkonia suppression effects in Quark - Gluon Plasma, in the search for
intermediate mass Higgs bosons and so on. It is shown that the cross section of
the coherent scattering process is great enough. This makes it suitable for
studying collective effects in nuclear interactions at high energies. An
example of such effects is given: large values of the invariant mass of a $Q
\bar{Q}$pair, $M_{Q \bar{Q}} \gsim 100$ GeV, in association with a large
rapidity gap between diffractive jets $\Delta \eta > 5$.

In the continuous case the parameter appears explicitly in the equation while
in the discrete case it corresponds to the number of steps for singularity
confinement. Two Schlesinger transformations are obtained relating the
solutions for some value $n$ to that corresponding to either n+1 or n+2.
