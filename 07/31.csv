is no tendency for any subset of single-pulse GRBs to fall near the

an order-of-magnitude in H$\alpha$ surface-brightness at a given line ratio. In
contrast, we find that all the galaxies (starburst and normal alike) define a
universal relation between line ratio and the relative H$\alpha$ surface
brightness ($\Sigma_{H\alpha}/\Sigma_e$, where $\Sigma_e$ is the mean H$\alpha$
surface brightness within the galaxy half-light radius). We show that such a
universal correlation is a natural outcome of a model in which the DIM is
photoionized gas that has a characteristic thermal pressure ($P$) that is
proportional to the mean rate of star-formation per unit area in the galaxy
($\Sigma_{SFR}$). Good quantitative agreement with the data follows if we
require the constant of proportionality to be consistent with the values of $P$

$P$ and $\Sigma_{SFR}$ may arise either because feedback from massive stars
heats the ISM or because $\Sigma_{SFR}$ is determined (or limited) by the mean

internal structure. For the total luminosity of the cluster in the ROSAT band
we obtain L = 6.4_{-0.3}^{+0.7} 10^{44} erg/s. We perform spectral fits for the
two ASCA instruments and for the ROSAT/PSPC simultaneously. The most reliable
numbers for the temperature and metallicity for the intracluster gas are T =
7.6^{+2.8}_{-1.6} keV and m = 0.22^{+0.24}_{-0.22} Msol, respectively. We find
a relatively small total mass, a small gas mass ratio and a small iron mass to
light ratio. These numbers together with relatively low luminosity for such an

0939+4713 is a young cluster still far away from a virialised state.

Rosado on the possible existing types of topological singular vectors (4 in
chiral Verma modules and 29 in complete Verma modules). Interestingly, we have
found two-dimensional spaces of singular vectors at level 1. Finally, by using
the topological twists and the spectral flows, we also obtain the maximal

moving along a curved trajectory. Using this vertex, an attempt is further made
to quantize the D-string coordinates and to compute the quantum amplitude for
scattering between elementary excitations of the D- and F-strings. By studying
the dependence on the Liouville mode for the D-string, it is found that the
vertex in our approximation consists of an infinite tower of local vertex
operators which are conformally invariant on their respective mass-shell. This
analysis indicates that, unlike the D-particle case, an off-shell extension of

that the realization of symmetry can be quite non-trivial when the dual

coupling h_{\pi NN}^{(1)} using recently developed effective field theory
techniques and find an asymmetry of A_\gamma = +0.17 h_{\pi NN}^{(1)} at
leading order. This asymmetry has the opposite sign to that given by
Desplanques, Donoghue and Holstein.

YN interactions. Besides the results for the fit to the scattering data, which
largely defines the model, we also present some applications to hypernuclear
systems using the G-matrix method. An important innovation with respect to the
original soft-core potential is the assignment of the cut-off masses for the
baryon-baryon-meson (BBM) vertices in accordance with broken SU(3)$_F$, which
serves to connect the NN and the YN channels. As a novel feature, we allow for
medium strong breaking of the coupling constants, using the $^3P_0$ model with
a Gell-Mann--Okubo hypercharge breaking for the BBM coupling. We present six
hyperon-nucleon potentials which describe the available YN cross section data
equally well, but which exhibit some differences on a more detailed level. The
differences are constructed such that the models encompass a range of
scattering lengths in the $\Sigma N$ and $\Lambda N$ channels. For the
scalar-meson mixing angle we obtained values $\theta_S=37$ to 40 degrees, which
points to almost ideal mixing angles for the scalar $q\bar{q}$ states. The
G-matrix results indicate that the remarkably different spin-spin terms of the
six potentials appear specifically in the energy spectra of $\Lambda$
hypernuclei.

primary structures taking advantage of the Self Organizing Maps algorithm and
of a numerical coding of the aminoacids based upon their physico-chemical
properties. Hydrophobicity, volume, surface area, hydrophilicity, bulkiness,
refractivity and polarity were subjected to a Principal Component Analysis and
the first two principal components, explaining 84.8 % of the total observed
variability, were used to cluster the aminoacids into 4 or 5 classes through a
k-means algorithm. This leads to an economical representation of the primary
structures which, in the construction of the input vectors for the Self
Organizing Maps algorithm, allows the consideration of up to tri- and
tetrapeptides' frequency matrices with minimal computational overload. In
comparison with previously explored conditions, namely symbolic coding of
aminoacids and dipeptides frequencies, no significant improvement was observed
in the classification of 69 cytochromes of the c type, characterized by a high
degree of structural and functional similarity, while a substantial improvement
occurred in the case of a data set including quite heterogeneous primary
structures.

These side-modes and the cavity field are generated in a highly entangled
state, characterized by thermal intensity fluctuations in the individual modes,
but with two-mode correlation functions which violate certain classical
inequalities. By injecting an initial coherent field into the optical cavity
one can significantly decrease the intensity fluctuations at the expense of
reducing the correlations, thus allowing for optical control over the quantum
statistical properties of matter waves.
