standard gravity, adding an apparent missing energy problem to its still not
yet adequately resolved missing mass one, while simultaneously requiring the
current universe to be a very special, fine-tuned one. We suggest that the
resolution of these difficulties lies not in the existence of more and more
exotic gravitational sources, but rather in the lack of reliability of the
extrapolation of standard gravity from its solar system origins to the
altogether larger distance scales associated with cosmology. We suggest a very
different such extrapolation, namely that associated with conformal gravity, to
find that all of these issues are then readily and naturally resolved.

activity which, in turn, changes the eigenfrequencies of the acoustic modes.
These frequency shifts have been observed both in low- and high-degree data,
and are found to be correlated with the solar cycle. Time-distance
helioseismology has shown that waves travelling through sunspots suffer time
delays. Also it is known that sunspots induce phase shifts between inwardly and
outwardly propagating waves.
  In the present work we show how these phase shifts are related to the
observed time delays by treating the scattering of acoustic waves off sunspots
as a diffraction problem.
  These time delays are then related to the frequency shifts of the modes. From
this relation we obtain a lower limit for the contribution of sunspots to the
observed frequency variations with the solar cycle. Moreover, we predict the
frequency dependence of the time delays suffered by rays travelling through a
sunspot.

smooth. This is quantified via a measurement of the amplitude of the Poisson
fluctuations in the number of unresolved stars encompassed by a CCD pixel

theoretical and empirical calibrations of the method, and review the numerous

  The observations do not match a calculated line profile extremely well at any
abundance for any isotopic ratio. If the B abundance previously determined from
observations at 2500 A is assumed, the calculated line profile is too weak,
indicating a possible blending line. Assuming that the absorption at 2090 A is
entirely due to boron, the best-fit total B abundance is higher than but
consistent with that obtained at 2500 A, and the best-fit isotopic ratio
(B11/B10) is in the range ~10:1 to ~4:1. If the absorption is not entirely due
to B and there is an unknown blend, the best-fit isotopic ratio may be closer
to 1:1. Future observations of a similar metal-poor star known to have
unusually low B should allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities.
The constraints that can be placed on the isotopic ratio based on comparisons

a power law with slope -1.0; there is no turnover down to W_r(2796) = 0.02 A at

0.02 A and that this is primarily a high-metallicity selection effect (Z/Z_sun]

tracers of sub-LLS environments where gas has been processed by stars. We
compare the number density of W_r(2796) > 0.02 A absorbers with that of both
high and low surface brightness galaxies and find a fiducial absorber size of
35h^-1 to 63h^-1 kpc, depending upon the assumed galaxy population and their

\alpha(25,12) \leq +0.35$ and $-2.50 \leq \alpha(60,25) \leq +0.85$. These
criteria allowed the detection of 382 galaxies, which are a mixture of
starburst and Seyfert galaxies.
  The starburst galaxies show an excess of FIR luminosity and their IRAS colors
are significantly different from those of Seyfert galaxies -- 99% of the
starburst galaxies in our sample have a spectral index $\alpha(60,25) < -1.9$.
As opposed to Seyfert galaxies, very few PDS starbursts are detected in X-rays.
  In the infrared, the starburst galaxies form a continuous sequence with
normal galaxies. But they generally can be distinguished from normal galaxies
by their spectral index $\alpha(60,25) > -2.5$. This color cut--off also marks
a change in the dominant morphologies of the galaxies: the normal IRAS galaxies
are preferentially late--type spirals (Sb and later), while the starbursts are
more numerous among early--type spirals (earlier than Sbc).
  No difference is found between the starbursts detected in the FIR and those
detected on the basis of UV excess. The PDS starburst galaxies represent the
FIR luminous branch of the UV-bright starburst nucleus galaxies, with mean FIR
luminosity $\log({\rm L}_{\rm IR}/{\rm L}_\odot) = 10.3 \pm 0.5$ and redshifts
smaller than 0.1. They form a complete sample limited in flux in the FIR at

redshift space correlation function of the Lya forest in multiple lines of
sight, as a function of angular and velocity separation. The geometric
parameter that is measured is f(z) = H(z) D(z)/c, where H(z) is the Hubble
constant and D(z) the angular diameter distance at redshift z. The correlation
function is computed in linear theory. We describe a method to measure it from
observations with the Gaussianization procedure of Croft et al (1998) to map
the Lya forest transmitted flux to an approximation of the linear density
field. The effect of peculiar velocities on the shape of the recovered power
spectrum is pointed out. We estimate the error in recovering the f(z) factor
from observations due to the variance in the Lya absorbers. We show that ~ 20
pairs of quasars (separations < 3') are needed to distinguish a flat \Omega_0=1
universe from a universe with \Omega_0=0.2, \Omega_\Lambda=0.8. A second
parameter that is obtained from the correlation function of the Lya forest is
\beta \simeq \Omega(z)^{0.6}/b (affecting the magnitude of the peculiar
velocities), where b is a linear theory bias of the Lya forest. The statistical
error of f(z) is reduced if b can be determined independently from numerical
simulations, reducing the number of quasar pairs needed for constraining
cosmology to approximately six. On small scales, where the correlation function
is higher, f(z) should be measurable with fewer quasars, but non-linear effects
must then be taken into account. The anisotropy of the non-linear redshift
space correlation function as a function of scale should also provide a precise
quantitative test of the gravitational instability theory of the Lya forest.

that the generic behavior at long time and length scales is described by the
scalar fixed point (reached for a given value of the magnetic field and of the

additional parameter, however, a fully rotationally invariant fixed point can
be reached, at which all components become critical simultaneously, with

anisotropy in the noise for the conserved quantities, i.e., by constraining
their diffusive dynamics to be at different temperatures T^\par and T^\perp in
d_\par- and d_\perp-dimensional subspaces, respectively. In the case of the
Sasv'ari-Schwabl-Sz'epfalusy (SSS) model for planar ferro- and isotropic
antiferromagnets, we assume a dynamical anisotropy in the noise for the
non-critical conserved quantities that are dynamically coupled to the
non-conserved order parameter. We find the equilibrium fixed point (with
isotropic noise) to be stable with respect to these non-equilibrium
perturbations, and the familiar equilibrium exponents therefore describe the
asymptotic static and dynamic critical behavior. Novel critical features are
only found in extreme limits, where the ratio of the effective noise
temperatures T^\par/T^\perp is either zero or infinite. On the other hand, for
model J for isotropic ferromagnets with a conserved order parameter, the
dynamical noise anisotropy induces effective long-range elastic forces, which
lead to a softening only of the d_\perp-dimensional sector in wavevector space
with lower noise temperature T^\perp < T^\par. The ensuing static and dynamic
critical behavior is described by power laws of a hitherto unidentified
universality class, which, however, is not accessible by perturbational means

universe is constructed. It consists of a six-dimensional gravitating
spacetime, containing several, approximately parallel (3+1)-dimensional
defects, or ``3-branes''. The Standard Model particles are confined to live on
one of the 3-branes while different four-dimensional field theories may inhabit
the others, in literally a case of ``parallel universes''. The effective field
theory is valid up to the six-dimensional Planck scale, where it must be
replaced by a more fundamental theory of gravity and 3-brane structure. Each
3-brane induces a conical geometry in the two dimensions transverse to it.
Collectively, the curvature induced by the 3-branes can compactify the extra
dimensions into a space of spherical topology. It is possible to take the
six-dimensional Planck scale to be not much larger than the weak scale, and the
compact space not much smaller than a millimeter, thereby realizing the recent
proposal by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali for eliminating the Gauge
Hierearchy Problem. In this case, an extra force is required to stabilize the
compact space against collapse. This is provided by a six-dimensional (compact)
U(1) gauge field with a magnetic flux quantum trapped in the compact space. The

functional. It can be applied to any theory whose action can be written as that
of the BF theory plus a functional of the B field. Examples of such theories
include BF theories with or without cosmological term, Yang-Mills theories and
gravity in various spacetime dimensions. Our main idea is two-fold. First, we
propose to take into account in the path integral certain distributional
configurations of the B field in which it is concentrated along lower
dimensional hypersurfaces in spacetime. Second, using the notion of generating
functional we develop perturbation expansion techniques, with the role of the
free theory played by the BF theory. We test our approach on various theories
for which the corresponding spin foam (state sum) models are known. We find
that it exactly reproduces the known models for BF and 2D Yang-Mills theories.
For the BF theory with cosmological term in 3 and 4 dimensions we calculate the
terms of the transition amplitude that are of the first order in the
cosmological constant, and find an agreement with the corresponding first order
terms of the known state sum models. We discuss implications of our results for

  the last page for details","Adv. Math. 136 (1998), 284-339",,,"math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We begin by showing that in a triangulated category, specifying a projective
class is equivalent to specifying an ideal I of morphisms with certain
properties, and that if I has these properties, then so does each of its
powers. We show how a projective class leads to an Adams spectral sequence and
give some results on the convergence and collapsing of this spectral sequence.
We use this to study various ideals. In the stable homotopy category we examine
phantom maps, skeletal phantom maps, superphantom maps, and ghosts. (A ghost is
a map which induces the zero map of homotopy groups.) We show that ghosts lead
to a stable analogue of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space, and we
calculate this stable analogue for low-dimensional real projective spaces. We
also give a relation between ghosts and the Hopf and Kervaire invariant
problems. In the case of A-infinity modules over an A-infinity ring spectrum,
the ghost spectral sequence is a universal coefficient spectral sequence. From
the phantom projective class we derive a generalized Milnor sequence for
filtered diagrams of finite spectra, and from this it follows that the group of
phantom maps from X to Y can always be described as a lim^1 group. The last two
sections focus on algebraic examples. In the derived category of an abelian
category we study the ideal of maps inducing the zero map of homology groups
and find a natural setting for a result of Kelly on the vanishing of composites
of such maps. We also explain how pure exact sequences relate to phantom maps
in the derived category of a ring and give an example showing that phantoms can
compose non-trivially.

in two-component reaction-diffusion systems. ``Superlattice'' patterns are
formed from eight or twelve Fourier modes, and feature structure at two
different length scales. Using perturbation theory, we derive simple analytical
expressions for the bifurcation equation coefficients on both rhombic and
hexagonal lattices. These expressions show that, no matter how complicated the
reaction kinectics, the nonlinear reaction terms reduce to just four effective
terms within the bifurcation equation coefficients. Moreover, at the hexagonal
degeneracy -- when the quadratic term in the hexagonal bifurcation equation
disappears -- the number of effective system parameters drops to two, allowing
a complete characterization of the possible bifurcation results at this
degeneracy. The general results are then applied to specific model equations,
to investigate the stability of different patterns within those models.
