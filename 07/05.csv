distribution of ejecta in core-collapse supernovae, assuming adiabatic,
spherically symmetric flow. We develop a simple yet accurate formula for the
blastwave shock velocity, and demonstrate that the entire final density
distribution can be approximated with simple models for the final pressure
distribution, along with the approximate shock-deposited entropy, in a way that
matches the results of simulations. We find that the distribution of density in
a star's ejecta depends on whether its outer envelope is radiative or
convective, and if convective, on the composition structure of the star; simple
approximate forms are presented for red and blue supergiant ejecta. Our models
are most accurate for the high-velocity ejecta from the periphery of a star,
where the shock dynamics are predictable. We present formulae for the final
density distribution of this material, for both radiative and efficiently
convective envelopes. These formulae limit to the well-known planar,
self-similar solutions for mass shells approaching the stellar surface. But,
the assumption of adiabatic flow fails at low optical depth, so this planar
limit need not be attained. Formulae are given for the observable properties of
the X-ray burst accompanying shock emergence, and their dependence on the
parameters of the explosion. Motivated by the relativistic expansion recently
inferred by Kulkarni et al. (1998) for the synchrotron shell around SN1998bw,
we estimate the criterion for relativistic mass ejection and the rest mass of
relativistic ejecta.

Firstly, in the gas forming the cold interstellar medium in scales from 10^{-4}
pc till 100 pc. Secondly, the galaxy distribution has been observed to be
fractal in scales up to hundreds of Mpc. We give here a short review of the
statistical mechanical (and field theoretical) approach developed by us. We
consider a non-relativistic self-gravitating gas in thermal equilibrium at
temperature T inside a volume V. The statistical mechanics of such system has
special features and, as is known, the thermodynamical limit does not exist in
its customary form. Moreover, the treatments through microcanonical, canonical
and grand canonical ensembles yield different results.We present here for the
first time the equation of state for the self-gravitating gas in the canonical
ensemble. We find that it has the form p = [N T/ V] f(eta), where p is the
pressure, N is the number of particles and \eta \equiv {G m^2 N \over V^{1/3}
T}. The N \to\infty and V \to\infty limit exists keeping \eta fixed. We compute
the function f(\eta) using Monte Carlo simulations and for small eta
analytically. We compute the thermodynamic quantities of the system as free
energy, entropy, chemical potential, specific heat, compressibility and speed
of sound. We reproduce the well-known gravitational phase transition associated
to the Jeans' instability. Namely, a gaseous phase for eta < eta_c and a
condensed phase for eta > eta_c. Moreover, we derive the precise behaviour of
the physical quantities near the transition. In particular, the pressure
vanishes as p \sim(eta_c-eta)^B with B \sim 0.2 and eta_c \sim 1.6 and the
energy fluctuations diverge as \sim(eta_c-eta)^{B-1}. The speed of sound
decreases monotonically and approaches the value sqrt{T/6} at the transition.

generalized hydrodynamic approach for a weakly inhomogeneous two-fluid model in
isothermal conditions. Local-density expressions are thereby derived for the
velocities of first and second sound in the weakly inhomogeneous superfluid and
for visco-elastic functions describing the transition from the hydrodynamic to

indicates that the Van Hove singularity is pinned to the Fermi level. Despite
these positive results, an ambiguity remains as to what instability causes the
pseudogap. Charge or spin density waves, superconducting fluctuations, and flux
phases all remain viable possibilities. This ambiguity arises because the
instabilities of the two-dimensional Van Hove singularity are associated with
an approximate SO(6) symmetry group, which contains Zhang's SO(5) as a
subgroup. It has two 6-component superspins, one of which mixes Zhang's
(spin-density wave plus d-wave superconductivity) superspin with a flux phase
operator. This is the smallest group which can explain striped phases in the

from a pseudogap state in the underdoped cuprates to a superconducting state at
optimal and overdoping, has been interpreted as evidence that the pseudogap
must be due to precursor pairing. We suggest an alternative explanation, that
the smoothness reflects a hidden SO(N) symmetry near the (pi,0) points of the
Brillouin zone (with N = 3, 4, 5, or 6). Because of this symmetry, the
pseudogap could actually be due to any of a number of nesting instabilities,
including charge or spin density waves or more exotic phases. We present a
detailed analysis of this competition for one particular model: the pinned
Balseiro-Falicov model of competing charge density wave and (s-wave)
superconductivity. We show that most of the anomalous features of both
tunneling and photoemission follow naturally from the model, including the
smooth crossover, the general shape of the pseudogap phase diagram, the
shrinking Fermi surface of the pseudogap phase, and the asymmetry of the
tunneling gap away from optimal doping. Below T_c, the sharp peak at Delta_1
and the dip seen in the tunneling and photoemission near 2Delta_1 cannot be
described in detail by this model, but we suggest a simple generalization to
account for inhomogeneity, which does provide an adequate description. We show
that it should be possible, with a combination of photoemission and tunneling,
to demonstrate the extent of pinning of the Fermi level to the Van Hove
singularity. A preliminary analysis of the data suggests pinning in the
underdoped, but not in the overdoped regime.

in QCD in terms of monopoles and the gluon configuration in the maximally
abelian (MA) gauge. Abelian dominance for the confinement force can be
analytically proved by regarding the off-diagonal angle variable as a random
variable in the lattice formalism. In the long-distance scale, the contribution
of off-diagonal gluons to the Wilson loop cancels each other and exhibits a
perimeter law behavior, which leads to exact abelian dominance on the string
tension if the finite size effect of the Wilson loop is removed. We investigate
the appearance of the monopole in the QCD vacuum, considering the role of
off-diagonal gluons. The monopole carries a large fluctuation of the gluon
field and provides a large abelian action in abelian projected QCD. Due to the
partial cancellation between the abelian part and the off-diagonal part of the
QCD action, the monopole can appear in QCD without large cost of the QCD
action. The off-diagonal gluon is necessary for existence of the monopole at
the short-distance scale. We study monopole condensation, which is the
requirement of the dual Higgs theory, by comparing the QCD vacuum with the
monopole-current system. We find that ``entropy'' of monopole-current dominates
than its ``energy'', and the monopole seems to be condensed at the infrared
scale in the QCD vacuum.

population inversion (LWI) in a coherently prepared closed three level V - type
system are investigated. This study is performed from the point of view of a
two color dressed state basis. Both of these processes are possible due to
atomic coherence and quantum interference contrary to simple intuitive
predictions. Merely on physical basis, one would expect a complementary process
to the amplification without inversion. We believe that absorption in the
presence of population inversion found in the dressed state picture utilized in
this study, constitutes such a process.
  Novel approximate analytic time dependent solutions, for coherences and
populations are obtained, and are compared with full numerical solutions
exhibiting excellent agreement. Steady state quantities are also calculated,
and the conditions under which the system exhibits absorption and gain with and

without inversion may occur, for a range of system parameters.
