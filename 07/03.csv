  Formation Rate","13 pages, including 1 figure. Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/311568",,"astro-ph",,"  We report on the implications of the peak in the cosmic star-formation rate
(SFR) at redshift z ~ 1.5 for the resulting population of low-mass X-ray
binaries(LMXB) and for that of their descendants, the millisecond radio pulsars
(MRP). Since the evolutionary timescales of LMXBs, their progenitors, and their
descendants are thought be significant fractions of the time-interval between
the SFR peak and the present epoch, there is a lag in the turn-on of the LMXB
population, with the peak activity occurring at z ~ 0.5 - 1.0. The peak in the
MRP population is delayed further, occurring at z < 0.5. We show that the
discrepancy between the birthrate of LMXBs and MRPs, found under the assumption
of a stead-state SFR, can be resolved for the population as a whole when the
effects of a time-variable SFR are included. A discrepancy may persist for
LMXBs with short orbital periods, although a detailed population synthesis will
be required to confirm this. Further, since the integrated X-ray luminosity
distribution of normal galaxies is dominated by X-ray binaries, it should show
strong luminosity evolution with redshift. In addition to an enhancement near
the peak (z ~ 1.5) of the SFR due to the prompt turn-on of the relatively
short-lived massive X-ray binaries and young supernova remnants, we predict a
second enhancement by a factor ~10 at a redshift between ~ 0.5 and ~ 1 due to
the delayed turn-on of the LMXB population. Deep X-ray observations of galaxies
out to z ~ 1 by AXAF will be able to observe this enhancement, and, by
determining its shape as a function of redshift, will provide an important new
method for constraining evolutionary models of X-ray binaries.

  distribution","17 pages, 4 figures To be published in A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Within the framework of hierarchical clustering we show that a simple
Press-Schechter-like approximation, based on spherical dynamics, provides a
good estimate of the evolution of the density field in the quasi-linear regime
up to $\Sigma \sim 1$. Moreover, it allows one to recover the exact series of
the cumulants of the probability distribution of the density contrast in the
limit $\Sigma \to 0$ which sheds some light on the rigorous result and on
``filtering''. We also obtain similar results for the divergence of the
velocity field.
  Next, we extend this prescription to the highly non-linear regime, using a
stable-clustering approximation. Then we recover a specific scaling of the
counts-in-cells which is indeed seen in numerical simulations, over a
well-defined range. To this order we also introduce an explicit treatment of
the behaviour of underdensities, which takes care of the normalization and is
linked to the low-density bubbles and the walls one can see in numerical
simulations. We compare this to a 1-dimensional adhesion model, and we present
the consequences of our prescription for the power-law tail and the cutoff of

unresolved (<= 0.2"") E-W. We find that 50 +/- 5% of the flux emerges from the
central 0.4"" and that a single unresolved point source can account for only 27
+/- 5% of the total flux. However, if the central peak arises from optically
thick emission, we estimate that the emitting region has a projected area >= 2
pc^2, and may thus contain a compact source such as a parsec-scale torus. We
observe a correspondence between the northern extension and the northeastern
sources appearing on the mid-infrared images and the [OIII] clouds A-C & E. We
interpret the faint optical counterpart to the mid-infrared southern extension
as being due to partial obscuration by the intervening disk of the host galaxy.
The N-S extension of the mid-infrared emission coincides with one wall of the

physical cause for the existence of filamentary penumbrae in sunspots, we
investigate the behavior of an individual fibril embedded in the deep penumbra.
The fibril is approximated by a thin magnetic flux tube which evolves
dynamically in the environment given by the global magnetostatic model of a
sunspot.
  Our simulation shows that the flux tube, initially positioned at the
penumbra--quiet Sun boundary in the model, will rise through its deep penumbra
developing a flow along the tube that points upward beneath the photosphere,
and radially outward above the photosphere. Our results suggest that a bright
filament may be formed by an extended tail of a penumbral grain. Such filaments
are optically thick, hotter than the surroundings, and elevated above a darker
background. An upflow in penumbral grains bends horizontally outwards above the
photosphere and gradually cools down due to radiative losses leading to a tail
that gradually darkens. The plasma flow inside the flux tube then becomes
transparent and the tube constitutes a thin elevated flow channel, that can
reproduce the observed features of the Evershed effect. We present also a new
acceleration mechanism for the Evershed flow. It is demonstrated that a local
surplus of gas pressure develops inside the tube as it rises through the
specific (superadiabatic and magnetized) penumbral background. The resulting
gradient of the gas pressure can drive the flow along the tube.

the general relativistic size and mass of a galaxy close to its Schwarzschild
radius. We assume boson stars to be transparent which allows the light to pass
through them though the light is gravitationally deflected. We assume boson
stars of the mass $M = 10^{10}M_\odot$ to be on non-cosmological distance from
the observer. We discuss the lens equation for these stars as well as the
details of magnification. We find that there are typically three images of a
star but the deflection angles may vary from arcseconds to even degrees. There
is one tangential critical curve (Einstein ring) and one radial critical curve
for tangential and radial magnification, respectively. Moreover, the deflection
angles for the light passing in the gravitational field of boson stars can be
very large (even of the order of degrees) which reflects the fact they are very
strong relativistic objects. We also propose a suitable formula for the lens
equation for such large deflection angles, and with the reservation that large
deflection angle images are highly demagnified but in the area of the
tangential critical curve, their existence may help in observational detection
of suitable lenses possessing characteristic features of boson stars which
could also serve as a direct evidence for scalar fields in the universe.

interface leads to suppression of the probability of Andreev reflection and
increase of the probability of normal reflection. We show that in the presence
of a Fermi velocity mismatch between the semiconductor and the superconductor
the angles of incidence and transmission are related according to the
well-known Snell's law in optics. As a consequence there is a critical angle of
incidence above which only normal reflection exists. For two and
three-dimensional interfaces a lower excess current compared to ballistic
transport with perpendicular incidence is found. Thus, the one-dimensional BTK
model overestimates the barrier strength for two and three-dimensional
interfaces.

These hard gluons produce flavour non-conserving vertices to the fermion
sector. They also produce excessive number of small instantons due to lattice
dislocations. Both unphysical effects could increase the propagation in
(di)-quarks to give the early onset in $\mu$. Thus we will present here a
modified action that avoids large fields close to the lattice cutoff. Some of

Both anomalies can be described in a minimal scheme where the respective

comparable oscillation frequencies. We discuss explicit forms of neutrino mass

condition as used in quantum cosmology; the second type is scattering boundary
conditions, as used in Feynman diagrams, applicable to asymptotically flat
space-time. The first yields a differential-equation form of the theory, dual
to the integral version appropriate to the second. Here, the first (Dirac)
approach is found to be extremely streamlined for the calculation of loop
amplitudes in these locally supersymmetric theories. By contrast,
Feynman-diagram methods have led to calculations which are typically so large

coordinate boundary conditions in $N = 1$ supergravity (without matter) is
exactly semi-classical, being of the form $exp(-I/\hbar)$, where $I$ is the
classical action, allowing for the presence of fermions as well as gravity on

quantum systems at finite temperature. A time correlation function among
subsystems will be derived which allows for a probabilistic interpretation. Our
derivation is non-perturbative and fully quantized. Various numerical methods
used to compute the needed path integrals in complex time were tested and their
effectiveness was compared. For checking the formalism we used the harmonic
oscillator where the numerical results could be compared with exact solutions.
Interesting results were also obtained for a system that presents tunneling. A
ring of coupled oscillators was treated in order to try to check
selfconsistency in the thermodynamic limit. The short time distribution seems
to propagate causally in the relativistic case. Our formalism can be extended
easily to field theories where it remains to be seen if relevant models will be
computable.
