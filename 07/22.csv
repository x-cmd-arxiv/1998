host galaxy at z=3.418, combined with optical and radio observations of the
burst afterglow, implies the extremely large isotropic energy release from the
burst in gamma-rays of approximately 3x10^53 ergs, some two orders of magnitude
higher than the previously commonly assumed numbers. The positional offset
between the optical transient observed at the Keck telescope and the centroid
of the proposed host galaxy in the HST image is 0.14 -+0.07 arcsec. We find no
evidence in our deep HST image for a chance foreground galaxy superposed along
the line of sight to the proposed host at z=3.418. The morphology and
photometric properties of this galaxy, such as the total flux, morphology,
radial surface profile and scale length, are typical as compared to other,

have proved to be very difficult to explain with previous models. a) Very
low-lying magnetic field lines, down to the photospheric neutral line, can open
toward infinity during an eruption. b) The eruption is driven solely by
magnetic free energy stored in a closed, sheared arcade; consequently, the
magnetic energy of the closed state is well above that of the post-eruption
open state. The key new feature of our model is that CMEs occur in multi-polar
topologies, in which reconnection between a sheared arcade and neighboring flux
systems triggers the eruption. In this ``magnetic breakout'' model,
reconnection removes the unsheared field above the low-lying, sheared core flux
near the neutral line, thereby allowing this core flux to burst open. We
present numerical simulations which demonstrate that our model can account for
the energy requirements for CMEs. We discuss the implication of the model for
CME/flare prediction.

finished He core burning. That is, the massive star is in the supergiant stage,
which lasts only $\sim 10^4$ years, so effects of mass loss by He winds are
small. Since the removal of the hydrogen envelope of the massive star occurs so
late, it evolves essentially as a single star, rather than one in a binary.
Thus, we can use evolutionary calculations of Woosley & Weaver (1995) of single
stars. We find that the black holes in transient sources can be formed from

only slightly smaller than the He core mass, typically $\sim 7\msun$.

Our morphological analysis of the galaxies in the HDF indicates that the
spheroidal galaxies, defined here as galaxies with a dominant bulge profile,
make up for only a small fraction, namely 8% of the galaxy population down to
m$_{F814W}(AB)$ = 26.0. We show that the larger fraction of early-type systems
in the van den Bergh sample is primarily due to the difference in
classification of 40% of small round galaxies with half-light radii <

Given the existing large dataset of HDF galaxies with measured spectroscopic
redshifts, we are able to determine that the majority of distant galaxies

constrain the transport of magnetic field: the magnetic field components are
defined at grid interfaces with their advective fluxes on grid edges, while
other quantities are defined at grid centers. The magnetic field at grid
centers for the upwind step is calculated by interpolating the values from grid
interfaces. The advective fluxes on grid edges for the magnetic field evolution

quantities. The correctness of the code is demonstrated through tests comparing
numerical solutions either with analytic solutions or with numerical solutions
from the code using an explicit divergence-cleaning method. Also the robustness
is shown through tests involving realistic astrophysical problems.

entropic part of the free energy enhances the effective repulsive interactions
between the chains. This configurational contribution goes as the fourth root
of the direct interactions. Enhancement originates from the coupling between
bending fluctuations and the compressibility of the nematic array normal to the
average director. In the second part of the paper we use osmotic stress to
measure the equation of state for DNA liquid crystals in 0.1M to 1M NaCl
solutions. These measurements cover 5 orders of magnitude in DNA osmotic
pressure. At high osmotic pressures the equation of state, dominated by
exponentially decaying hydration repulsion, is independent of the ionic
strength. At lower pressures the equation of state is dominated by fluctuation
enhanced electrostatic double layer repulsion. The measured equation of state
for DNA fits well with our theory for all salt concentrations. We are able to
extract the strength of the direct electrostatic double layer repulsion. This
is a new and alternative way of measuring effective charge densities along
semiflexible polyelectrolytes.

difficult to account for in this picture, either individually or when taken
together. Resolutions of these paradoxes usually call for additional
assumptions on the nature of the rupture process (such as novel modes of
deformations and ruptures) prior to and/or during an earthquake, on the nature
of the fault and on the effect of trapped fluids within the crust at
seismogenic depths. We review the evidence for the essential importance of
water and its interaction with the modes of deformations. Water is usually seen
to have mainly the mechanical effect of decreasing the normal lithostatic
stress in the fault core on one hand and to weaken rock materials via
hydrolytic weakening and stress corrosion on the other hand. We also review the
evidences that water plays a major role in the alteration of minerals subjected
to finite strains into other structures in out-of-equilibrium conditions. This
suggests novel exciting routes to understand what is an earthquake, that

calculated nonperturbatively in the Model of the Stochastic Vacuum, with
appropriate wavefunctions. For the considered processes the dipoles have
extensions in the range of hadron sizes. We now extend this idea to small
dipoles and high energies. The energy dependence is modeled in a
phenomenological way: we assume that there a two pomerons, the soft- and the
hard-pomeron, each being a simple pole in the complex angular plane. We couple
dipoles of hadronic size to the soft-pomeron and small dipoles to the
hard-pomeron. For small dipoles we take the perturbative gluon exchange into
account. By that way we obtain an energy dependent dipole-dipole scattering
amplitude which can be used for all the processes with the same parameters. We
show that this approach can describe in addition to all the low energy results

possible effect of these discrepancies on the SM fit of the Higgs boson mass.
The scale factor fits increase the value of $sin^{2}\theta^{lepton}_{eff}$ by
as much as two standard deviations. The central value of the Higgs boson mass
increases as much as a factor of two, to $\simeq 200$ GeV, and the 95%

is based not simply on the discrepant measurements, as was the case in a

which one or more of a collection of measurements are in conflict with a

correlators derived in hep-ph/9709432 by restricting ourselves to a double
logarithmic region. In this region our evolution equation becomes local in
transverse momentum space and amenable to simple analysis. It provides a
complete nonlinear generalization of the GLR equation. We find that the full
double log evolution at high density becomes strikingly different from its
linear doubly logarithmic DGLAP counterpart. An effective mass is induced by
the nonlinear corrections which at high densities slows down the evolution
considerably. We show that at small values of impact parameter the gluonic
density grows as a logarithm of energy. At higher values of impact parameter
the growth is faster, since the density of gluons is lower and nonlinearities
are less important.

calculated within a large variety of constituent models and their values
related to the features of the interquark interaction picture. The r\^ole of

degrees of freedom give a quite sizeable contributions to both and the meson

tube, but it increases with exponential rapidity as one approaches the walls
formed by the current carrying wires. Hence, cold atoms passing through the
tube may be reflected by magnetic mirror effects near the walls. Applying this
technique to a free-falling cloud of magneto-optically cooled caesium atoms we
hope to construct atomic guides to facilitate the manipulation of cold atomic

guns with proper description of the photocathode bunch generation. The model
algorithm is based on a coupled integration of Newton and Maxwell equations
under a slowly varying envelope approximation for the time evolution of mode

for a set of bunch slices. In this way beam loading effects and higher order
