important fraction of star--formation be hidden in dust--enshrouded systems at
intermediate and high--redshift. We show that, according to such models,
galaxies cannot stand as important contributors to the background
hydrogen-ionizing flux at high-redshift unless neutral hydrogen absorption

the robustness of such a result.

and time scales of the Parker instability, we took three models of gravity,
uniform, linear and realistic ones. To make comparisons of the three gravity
models on a common basis, we first fixed the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas
pressure at $\alpha$ = 0.25, that of cosmic-ray pressure at $\beta$ = 0.4, and
the rms velocity of interstellar clouds at $a_s$ = 6.4 km s$^{-1}$, and then
adjusted parameters of the gravity models in such a way that the resulting
density scale heights for the three models may all have the same value of 160
pc. Performing linear stability analyses onto equilibrium states under the
three models with the typical ISM conditions, we calculate the maximum growth
rate and corresponding length scale for each of the gravity models. Under the
uniform gravity the Parker instability has the growth time of 1.2$\times10^{8}$
years and the length scale of 1.6 kpc for symmetric mode. Under the realistic
gravity it grows in 1.8$\times10^{7}$ years for both symmetric and
antisymmetric modes, and develops density condensations at intervals of 400 pc
for the symmetric mode and 200 pc for the antisymmetric one. A simple change of
the gravity model has thus reduced the growth time by almost an order of
magnitude and its length scale by factors of four to eight. These results
suggest that an onset of the Parker instability in the ISM may not necessarily
be confined to the regions of high $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Meissner effect (PME) has been investigated in detail. From the field-cooled
magnetization behavior, two well-defined temperatures can be associated with
the appearance of the PME: T_1 (< T_c) indicates the characteristic temperature
where the paramagnetic moment first appears and a lower temperature T_p (< T_1)
defines the temperature where the positive moment no longer increases. During
the subsequent warming, the paramagnetic moment begins to decrease at T_p and
then vanishes at T_1 with the magnitude of the magnetization change between
these two temperatures being nearly the same as that during cooling. This
indicates that the nature of the PME is reversible and not associated with flux
motion. Furthermore, the appearance of this paramagnetic moment is even
observable in fields as large as 0.2 T even though the magnetization does not
remain positive to the lowest temperatures. Magnetic hysteresis loops in the
temperature range between T_1 and T_p also exhibit a distinct shape that is
different from the archetypal shape of a bulk type-II superconductor. These
behaviors are discussed in terms of the so-called 'giant vortex state'.

two immiscible bulk phases, A and B. We consider general dynamical exponent
$z$, where $x_t\sim t^{1/z}$ is the rms diffusion distance after time $t$. At
short times the number of reactions per unit area, $R_t$, is {\em 2nd order} in
the far-field reactant densities $n_A^{\infty},n_B^{\infty}$. For spatial
dimensions $d$ above a critical value $d_c=z-1$, simple mean field (MF)
kinetics pertain, $R_t\sim Q_b t n_A^{\infty} n_B^{\infty}$ where $Q_b$ is the
local reactivity. For low dimensions $d<d_c$, this MF regime is followed by 2nd
order diffusion controlled (DC) kinetics, $R_t \approx x_t^{d+1} n_A^{\infty}
n_B^{\infty}$, provided $Q_b > Q_b^* \sim (n_B^{\infty})^{[z-(d+1)]/d}$.
Logarithmic corrections arise in marginal cases. At long times, a cross-over to
{\em 1st order} DC kinetics occurs: $R_t \approx x_t n_A^{\infty}$. A density
depletion hole grows on the more dilute A side. In the symmetric case
($n_A^{\infty}=n_B^{\infty}$), when $d<d_c$ the long time decay of the
interfacial reactant density, $n_A^s$, is determined by fluctuations in the
initial reactant distribution, giving $n_A^s \sim t^{-d/(2z)}$.
Correspondingly, A-rich and B-rich regions develop at the interface analogously
to the segregation effects established by other authors for the bulk reaction
$A+B\to\emptyset$. For $d>d_c$ fluctuations are unimportant: local mean field
theory applies at the interface (joint density distribution approximating the
product of A and B densities) and $n_A^s \sim t^{(1-z)/(2z)}$. We apply our
results to simple molecules (Fickian diffusion, $z=2$) and to several models of
short-time polymer diffusion ($z>2$).

to reconsider the problem in a dynamical framework, which does not require
replicas, although the equilibrium properties should be recovered in the large

a dynamical picture. In this note we show that in fact new interactions are
also generated in the stochastic approach. Similarly these interactions are
found to be singular below dimension eight. These critical singularities
require the introduction of a time origin $t_0$ at which initial data are
given. The dynamical properties are thus dependent upon the waiting time. It is
shown here that one can indeed find a complete correspondence between the
equilibrium singularities in the $n=0$ limit, and the singularities in the
dynamics when the initial time $t_0$ goes to minus infinity, with $n$ replaced
by $-\frac{1}{t_0}$. There is thus complete coherence between the two
approaches.

ubiquitous, whereas vortices form a dilute gas of closed vortex loops and

percolation temperature turns out to be roughly independent of the lattice

very strong on the low-temperature side. The percolation transition is a

collapses while in the case of spatially flat expanding universe its fate
depends on the rate of expansion. If the universe is inflationary, then there
is a possibility that texture will expand eternally; in the case of exponential
inflation the texture may also shrink or expand eternally to a finite limiting
size, although this behavior is degenerate. In the case of power law
noninflationary expansion topological texture eventually collapses. In a cold
matter dominated universe we find that texture which is formed comoving with
the universe expansion starts collapsing when its spatial size becomes
comparable to the Hubble size, which result is in agreement with the previous
considerations. In the nonlinear sigma-model approximation we consider also the
final stage of the collapsing ellipsoidal topological texture. We show that
during collapse of such a texture at least two of its principal dimensions
shrink to zero in a similar way, so that their ratio remains finite. The third
dimension may remain finite (collapse of cigar type), or it may also shrink to
zero similar to the other two dimensions (collapse of scaling type), or shrink
to zero similar to the product of the remaining two dimensions (collapse of
pancake type).

study is the correlation function of the nucleon interpolating field, where the
matrix element is taken with respect to the one-nucleon state. The dispersion
integral of the correlation function around the nucleon threshold is
investigated in detail. It turns out that the integral can be identified as a
measure of the nucleon-nucleon interaction strength, which is proportional to
the scattering length in the small scattering length limit and to one half of
the effective range in the large scattering length limit. New operators must be
taken into account in the OPE of the correlation function. There behavior
operators do not vanish when the matrix element is taken with respect to the
spin-nonaveraged one-nucleon state. The Wilson coefficients of such operators
are calculated. The sum rules obtained in this manner relate the spin-dependent
nucleon-nucleon interaction strengths with the spin-dependent nucleon matrix
elements of the quark-gluon composite operators. The sum rules imply that the
interaction is stronger in the spin-triplet channel than in the spin-singlet
channel, but that the spin-dependence of the nucleon-nucleon interactions is
rather small. In the spin-singlet channel the calculated strength is in
qualitative agreement with the empirical strength, which is estimated by the
empirical low energy scattering observables.

generalizations of the dispersionless Toda hierarchy, is studies for systems
derived from a rational Lax function. One consequence of having a rational
rather than a polynomial Lax function is that the corresponding bi-Hamiltonian
structures are degenerate, i.e. the metric which defines the Hamiltonian
structure has vanishing determinant. Frobenius manifolds provide a natural
setting in which to study the bi-Hamiltonian structure of certain classes of
hydrodynamic systems. Some ideas on how this structure may be extanded to
include degenerate bi-Hamiltonian structures, such as those given in the first
part of the paper, are given.
