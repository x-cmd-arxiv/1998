Games are simulated between cognitive players who build the opponent's internal
model and decide their next strategy from predictions based on the model. In
this paper, internal models are constructed by the recurrent neural network
(RNN), and the iterated prisoner's dilemma game is performed. The RNN allows us
to express the internal model in a geometrical shape. The complicated
transients of actions are observed before the stable mutually defecting
equilibrium is reached. During the transients, the model shape also becomes
complicated and often experiences chaotic changes. These new chaotic dynamics
of internal models reflect the dynamical and high-dimensional rugged landscape

Beyond 3 r_eff along the major axis of the galaxy light, these globular

an equally substantial spin (lambda ~ 0.18). The present appearance of M87 is
most likely the product of a single major merger, since this event is best able
to account for so sizable a spin. A rotation this large makes improbable any
significant accretion of material after this merger, since that would have
diluted the rotation signature. We see weak evidence for a difference between
the kinematics of the metal-poor and metal-rich population, in the sense that
the metal-poor globular clusters appear to dominate the rotation. If, as we
suspect, the last major merger event of M87 was mainly dissipationless and did
not trigger the formation of a large number of globular clusters, the kinematic
difference between the two could reflect their orbital properties in the
progenitor galaxies; these differences would be compatible with these
progenitors having formed in dissipational mergers. However, to put strong
kinematic constraints on the origin of the globular clusters themselves is
difficult, given the complex history of the galaxy and its last dominant merger
event.

well-defined period-luminosity relation, allowing us to readily distinguish
between overtone and fundamental pulsators in nearly every case. Unlike RR Lyr
stars, the pulsation mode turns out to be uncorrelated with light-curve shape,
nor do the overtone pulsators tend towards shorter periods compared to the
fundamental pulsators. Using the period-luminosity (PL) relations from Nemec et

in both the QPO and the broad-band variability leads us to hypothesize that the
QPO is due to interaction between the physical components which dominate the

conclude that these QPO should be observed from BHCs during transition between

diffuse gas makes a sizeable contribution to the total visible mass) as it does

Hbeta emission lines and the radio luminosity. However, our observations are
not easily reconciled with the idea that these correlations are caused by the
increase in the power of the photoionizing quasar as the jet power increases,
with average ISM properties not changing appreciably with redshift or radio
power: not only do we find that the scatter in the L_[OIII] vs. L_radio
correlation is significantly larger than in L_[OII]} vs. L_radio and L_Hbeta
vs. L_radio correlations, but the ionization state deduced from the emission
lines does not increase with radio power as predicted by the simple, constant
ISM, photionization model. We conclude that: (a) there exists a considerable
range in the quasar ionizing luminosity at a given redshift; and (b) that the
mean density of the emission line clouds is larger in the high redshift/high
power radio sources. The latter density enhancement may either be a consequence
of the increased importance of jet-cloud interactions or, alternatively, due to
a higher pressure in the confining hot ISM, in the high redshift objects. Deep
spectra show that many of the sources in our sample are broad line radio
galaxies (BLRG). The fact that the BLRG are observed out the redshift limit of
the survey, overlapping in redshift with the quasars, argues against the idea
that BLRG are simply the low radio power counterparts of high power, high

electric field and Schwarzchild-like spacetimes. Both problems can be reduced
to solving an effective one-dimensional Schrodinger equation with a potential
barrier. In the electric field case, the potential is that of an inverted
oscillator -x^2 while in the case of Schwarchild-like spacetimes, the potential
is of the form -1/x^2 near the horizon. The transmission and reflection
coefficients can easily be obtained for both potentials. To describe particle
production, these coefficients have to be suitably interpreted. In the case of
the electric field, the standard Bogoliubov coefficients can be identified and
the standard gauge invariant result is recovered. However, for
Schwarzchild-like spacetimes, such a tunnelling interpretation appears to be
invalid. The Bogoliubov coefficients cannot be determined by using an
identification process similar to that invoked in the case of the electric
field. The reason for such a discrepancy appears to be that, in the tunnelling
method, the effective potential near the horizon is singular and symmetric. We
also provide a new and simple semi-classical method of obtaining Hawking's
result in the (t,r) co-ordinate system of the usual standard Schwarzchild
metric. We give a prescription whereby the singularity at the horizon can be
regularised with Hawking's result being recovered. This regularisation
prescription contains a fundamental asymmetry that renders both sides of the
horizon dissimilar. Finally, we attempt to interpret particle production by the
electric field as a tunnelling process between the two sectors of the Rindler
metric.

have given evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations with large
mixing and $\Delta m^2$ in the range 10^{-3}-10^{-2} eV^2. In this work we
discuss critically some of the possible experimental strategies to confirm this
result and determine more accurately the neutrino oscillation parameters. A
possible method is the development of long-baseline accelerator neutrino beams.
The accelerator beams can have higher intensity and higher average energy than
the atmospheric flux, and if (\nu_\mu \leftrightarrow \nu_\tau) oscillations
are indeed the cause of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly, they can produce a
measurable rate of $\tau$ leptons for most (but not all) of the values of the
oscillation parameters that are a solution to the atmospheric data. On the
other hand measurements of atmospheric neutrinos with large statistics and/or
better experimental resolutions, can also provide convincing evidence for
oscillations, thanks to unambiguous detectable effects on the energy, zenith
angle and L/E_\nu distributions of the events. The study of these effects can
provide a precise determination of the oscillations parameters. The range of
L/E_\nu available for atmospheric neutrinos is much larger than in
long-baseline accelerator experiments, and the sensitivity extends to lower
values of \Delta m^2.

In the generic case with NS-NS and R-R charges, the S^3 not only becomes
S^3/Z_p but is also squashed, with a squashing parameter that is related to the
values of the charges. Similar results apply if we regard AdS_3 as a bundle
over AdS_2 and T-dualise along the fibre. We show that Hopf T-dualities relate
different black holes, and that they preserve the entropy. The AdS_3 x S^3

nondegenerate to fully degenerate nonrelativistic or relativistic electrons.
The calculations are based on the linear-response theory for the electron-ion
interaction, including the local-field corrections in the electronic dielectric
function. The thermodynamic quantities are calculated in the framework of the
N-body hypernetted-chain equations and fitted by analytic expressions. We
present also accurate analytic approximations for the free energy of the ideal
electron gas at arbitrary degeneracy and relativity and for the excess free
energy of the one-component plasma of ions (OCP) derived from Monte Carlo
simulations.
  The extension to multi-ionic mixtures is discussed within the framework of
the linear mixing rule. These formulae provide a completely analytic, accurate
description of the thermodynamic quantities of fully ionized electron-ion
Coulomb plasmas, a useful tool for various applications from liquid state
theory to dense stellar matter.

these discoveries. The present paper is an historical account of the
circumstances in which she discovered and proved these theorems which
physicists refer to collectively as Noether's Theorem. The work was done soon
after Hilbert's discovery of the variational principle which gives the field
equations of general relativity. The failure of local energy conservation in
the general theory was a problem that concerned people at that time, among them
David Hilbert, Felix Klein, and Albert Einstein. Noether's theorems solved this
problem. With her characteristically deep insight and thorough analysis, in
solving that problem she discovered very general theorems that have profoundly
influenced modern physics.

good starting point to obtain systematically fast Fourier transforms for

space imposed by the qubit architecture suggests to consider groups of order
2^n first (where n is the number of qubits). As an example, fast quantum
Fourier transforms for all 4 classes of non-abelian 2-groups with cyclic normal
subgroup of index 2 are explicitly constructed in terms of quantum circuits.
The (quantum) complexity of the Fourier transform for these groups of size 2^n

quantum-dynamical systems in continuous space. Each member of the class is
characterized by a Hamiltonian which is the sum of two parts. While one part is
deterministic, time-independent and quadratic, the Weyl-Wigner symbol of the
other part is a homogeneous Gaussian random field which is delta correlated in
time, but smoothly correlated in position and momentum. The averaged dynamics
of the resulting white-noise system is shown to be a monotone mixing increasing
quantum-dynamical semigroup. Its generator is computed explicitly. Typically,
in the course of time the mean energy of such a system grows linearly to
infinity. In the second part of the paper an extended model is studied, which,
in addition, accounts for dissipation by coupling the white-noise system
linearly to a quantum-mechanical harmonic heat bath. It is demonstrated that,
under suitable assumptions on the spectral density of the heat bath, the mean
energy then saturates for long times.
