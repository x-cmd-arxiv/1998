gravitational distortion maps, from 2.5' to 10 degree scales, for different

non-parametric least square method after noise due to the galaxy intrinsic
ellipticities has been added on. The shearing of the galaxies is performed
using the full lensing equation, without any hypothesis like the weak lensing
approximation, or other linearization. It is shown that, in the reconstructed
maps the noise acts as a perfect uncorrelated Poisson noise, with no
propagation at large scales. The measured power spectrum and first four moments
of the convergence can be corrected accurately for this source of noise. Using
60 realizations for each model, we show that a weak lensing survey of 5x5
degrees with a typical sheared background population of 30 gal/arcmin^2 at a
redshift z_s=1, is able to probe the amplitude of the power spectrum with a few
percents accuracy. Such a survey would lead to a 6 sigma separation between
open (Omega=0.3) and flat (Omega=1) model. This separation is shown to be
robust against different hypothesis for the normalization or the shape of the
power spectrum, and does not require very deep surveys. The observational
strategy for an optimal measurement of the power spectrum and the moments of
the convergence is discussed.

the explosion is spherically symmetric, whereas Cas A is famous for the
asymmetric form of the remnant. Recently, Nagataki et al. (1997) calculated the
explosive nucleosynthesis of axisymmetrically deformed collapse-driven

the stronger alpha-rich freezeout in the polar region. In this paper, we apply

years and the intervening space is transparent to the gamma-ray line from the
decay of $^{44}$Ti. On the other hand, we show the axisymmetric explosion
models can solve the problem. We expect the same effect from a three

will also occur in that case in the region where the larger energy is
deposited.

$\lambda_\odot=116.5^\circ$). Maximal Zenithal Hourly Rates (ZHRs) are equal to
$3.6\pm1.2$. The structure of the radiant analyzed by {\sc radiant} software is
most compact for geocentric velocity of the events equal to 41 km/s, and for
the drift of the radiant (in units $^\circ$/day) equal to $\Delta\alpha=+0.6$
$\Delta\delta=+0.2$. Center of the radiant for the moment of maximum is

stream. Comparing the velocity distributions of 754 possible $\alpha$-Cygnids
and 4339 sporadic events by $\chi^2$ and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests we conclude
that both distributions are different with probability very close to 1.0.

located in the stagnation region of the bow-shock cools to produce a high

Redshift Survey. Every quasar with a low-frequency (151 MHz) radio flux-density
S_151 > 0.5 Jy in two regions of the sky covering 0.013 sr is included; 23 of
these have sufficient extended flux to meet the selection criteria, 18 of these
have steep radio spectra (hereafter denoted as SSQs). The key advantage of this
sample over most samples of RLQs is the lack of an optical magnitude limit. By
combining the 7C and 3CRR samples, we have investigated the properties of RLQs
as a function of redshift z and radio luminosity L_151.
  We derive the radio luminosity function (RLF) of RLQs and find that the data
are well fitted by a single power-law with slope alpha_1=1.9. We find that
there must be a break in the RLQ RLF at log_10(L_151 / W Hz^-1 sr^-1) < 27, in
order for the models to be consistent with the 7C and 6C source counts. The
z-dependence of the RLF follows a one-tailed gaussian which peaks at z=1.7. We
find no evidence for a decline in the co-moving space density of RLQs at higher
redshifts.
  A positive correlation between the radio and optical luminosities of SSQs is
observed, confirming a result of Serjeant et al. (1998). We are able to rule
out this correlation being due to selection effects or biases in our combined
sample. The radio-optical correlation and best-fit model RLF enable us to
estimate the distribution of optical magnitudes of quasars in samples selected
at low radio frequencies. We conclude that for samples with S_151 < 1 Jy one
must use optical data significantly deeper than the POSS-I limit (R approx 20),
in order to avoid severe incompleteness.

engine - a black hole of several solar masses accreting matter from a disk at a
rate 0.01 to 10 solar masses per second. Using a numerical model for
relativistic disk accretion, we have studied steady-state accretion at these
high rates. Inside a radius ~ 10**8 cm, for accretion rates greater than about
0.01 solar masses per second, a global state of balanced power comes to exist
between neutrino losses, chiefly pair capture on nucleons, and dissipation.
Energy emitted in neutrinos is less, and in the case of low accretion rates,
very much less, than the maximum efficiency factor for black hole accretion
(0.057 for no rotation; 0.42 for extreme Kerr rotation) times Mdot c**2. The
efficiency for producing a pair fireball along the rotational axis by neutrino
annihilation is calculated and found to be highly variable and very sensitive
to the accretion rate. For some of the higher accretion rates studied, it can
be several per cent or more; for accretion rates less than 0.05 solar masses
per second, it is essentially zero. The efficiency of the Blandford-Znajek
mechanism in extracting rotational energy from the black hole is also
estimated. In light of these results, the viability of various gamma-ray burst
models is discussed and the sensitivity of the results to disk viscosity, black
hole rotation rate, and black hole mass explored. A diverse range of GRB
energies seems unavoidable and neutrino annihilation in hyper-accreting black
hole systems can explain bursts up to 10**52 erg. Larger energies may be
inferred for beaming systems.

sigma(R) is the same for mass, varies from 2.6 at 1 h^{-1} Mpc to 1.2 at 30
h^{-1} Mpc. Including the dependence of the galaxy density on local gas
temperature as well as on local mass density can fully account for this scale
dependence. Galaxy density depends on temperature because gas which is too hot
cannot cool to form galaxies; this causes scale dependence of b(R) because
local gas temperature is related to the gravitational potential, and thus
contains information about the large scale density field. We show that
temperature dependence generally causes b(R) to vary on quasilinear and
nonlinear scales, indicating that scale dependence of bias may be a generic
effect in realistic galaxy formation scenarios. We find that the relationship
between the galaxy and mass density fields is also a function of galaxy age. On
large scales, the older galaxies are highly biased (b ~ 1.7) and highly
correlated (r ~ 1.0) with the mass density field; younger galaxies are not
biased (b ~ 0.8) and are poorly correlated (r ~ 0.5) with the mass. We argue
that linear bias is inadequate to describe the relationship between galaxies

`breakdown' phenomena. For antiferromagnetic coupling, majority and minority
spins are interchanged from one magnetic layer to the next. Cyclotron orbits
are also traveled in opposite directions, producing a compensation-like effect

In the sixties, an analytic approach was developed for the investigation of
scattering from such potentials, with emphasis on the polydromy of the wave
function in the r variable. The present paper extends those early results to an
arbitrary number of spatial dimensions. The Hill-type equation which leads, in
principle, to the evaluation of the polydromy parameter, is obtained from the
Hill equation for a two-dimensional problem by means of a simple change of
variables. The asymptotic forms of the wave function as r tends to zero and as
r tends to infinity are also derived. The Darboux technique of intertwining
operators is then applied to obtain an algorithm that makes it possible to
solve the Schrodinger equation with a singular potential containing many
negative powers of r, if the exact solution with even just one term is already
known.

interactions on a molecular scale, with the goal of gaining insight into the
molecular origins of hydrophobic effects. The model is based on the fundamental
relation between the probability for cavity formation in bulk water resulting
from molecular-scale density fluctuations, and the hydration free energy of the
simplest hydrophobic solute, a hard particle. This probability is estimated
using an information theory (IT) approach, incorporating experimentally
available properties of bulk water -- the density and radial distribution
function. The IT approach reproduces the simplest hydrophobic effects:
hydration of spherical nonpolar solutes, the potential of mean force between
methane molecules, and solvent contributions to the torsional equilibrium of
butane. Applications of this approach to study temperature and pressure effects
provide new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding.
The IT model relates the hydrophobic-entropy convergence observed in protein
unfolding experiments to the macroscopic isothermal compressibility of water. A
novel explanation for pressure denaturation of proteins follows from an
analysis of the pressure stability of hydrophobic aggregates, suggesting that
water penetrates the hydrophobic core of proteins at high pressures. This
resolves a long-standing puzzle, whether pressure denaturation contradicts the
hydrophobic-core model of protein stability. Finally, issues of ``dewetting''
of molecularly large nonpolar solutes are discussed in the context of a
recently developed perturbation theory approach.
