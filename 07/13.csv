Our results disagree with recent claims that current GRB observations can be
used to strongly constrain the cosmic star formation history. Instead, we find
that relaxing the assumption that GRBs are standard candles renders a very
broad range of models consistent with the BATSE number-flux relation. We
explicitly construct two sample distributions, one tracing the star formation
history and one with a constant comoving density. We show that both
distributions are compatible with the observed fluxes and redshifts of the

required to distinguish the two models.

effects, (1) tidal force from the potential well of the cluster, (2) increase
of external pressure when the galaxy plows into the intracluster medium, (3)
high-speed encounters between galaxies, are investigated. General analysis
indicates that the star formation rate increases significantly when the
pressure of molecular clouds rises above $\sim 3\times 10^5 cm^{-3} K$ in $\sim
10^8$ yr. The tidal force from the potential well of the cluster increases
pressures of molecular clouds in a disk galaxy infalling towards the cluster
center. Before the galaxy reaches the cluster center, the star formation rate
reaches a maximum. The peak is three to four times larger than the initial
value. If this is the main mechanism of the Butcher-Oemler effect, blue
galaxies are expected to be located within $\sim 300$ kpc from the center of
the cluster. However this prediction is inconsistent with the recent
observations. The increase of external pressure when the galaxy plows into the
intracluster medium does not change star formation rate of a disk galaxy
significantly. The velocity perturbation induced by a single high-speed
encounter between galaxies is too small to affect star formation rate of a disk
galaxy, while successive high-speed encounters (galaxy harassment) trigger star
formation activity because of the accumulation of gas in the galaxy center.
Therefore, the galaxy harassment remains as the candidate for a mechanism of
the Butcher-Oemler effect.

method, using WordNet (Miller et al. 1990), produced multiple
cross-classification of articles, primarily due to the bushy nature of the verb
tree coupled with the sense disambiguation problem. Our second approach using
English Verb Classes and Alternations (EVCA) Levin (1993) showed that
monosemous categorization of the frequent verbs in WSJ made it possible to
usefully discriminate documents. For example, our results show that articles in
which communication verbs predominate tend to be opinion pieces, whereas
articles with a high percentage of agreement verbs tend to be about mergers or
legal cases. An evaluation is performed on the results using Kendall's Tau. We
present convincing evidence for using verb semantic classes as a discriminant
