Expressions for the diffusion coefficients appropriate for general relativistic

diffusion coefficients are evaluated using a field-theoretical finite
temperature EOS that includes the possible presence of hyperons. The variation
of the diffusion coefficients is studied as a function of EOS and compositional
parameters. We present results from numerical simulations of protoneutron star

X-ray background observed with ROSAT. The bulk of these nonthermal X-rays are
due to line emission from fast O ions of energies around 1 MeV/nucleon. This is
the typical energy per particle in the ejecta of the supernova which is thought
to have energized the bubble. We find that there is sufficient total energy in
the ejecta to produce X-rays of the required intensity, subject to the details
of the evolution of the fast particle population since the supernova explosion
(about 3 10$^5$ years ago based on the age of the Geminga pulsar). The
unequivocal signature of lines from deexcitations in fast ions is their large
width ($\delta E/E$~0.1 for O lines), which will clearly distinguishes them
from X-ray lines produced in a hot plasma. If a small fraction of the total
ejecta energy is converted into accelerated particle kinetic energy (>~30
MeV/nucleon), the gamma-ray line emission produced in the boundary shell of the
local hot bubble could account for the recently reported COMPTEL observations
of nuclear gamma-ray lines from a broad region towards the Galactic center.

D58 (1998) 105022","10.1103/PhysRevD.58.105022","UCONN-98-13","hep-th",,"  We apply the resolvent technique to the computation of the QED effective
action in time dependent electric field backgrounds. The effective action has
both real and imaginary parts, and the imaginary part is related to the pair
production probability in such a background. The resolvent technique has been
applied previously to spatially inhomogeneous magnetic backgrounds, for which
the effective action is real. We explain how dispersion relations connect these
two cases, the magnetic case which is essentially perturbative in nature, and
the electric case where the imaginary part is nonperturbative. Finally, we use
a uniform semiclassical approximation to find an expression for very general
time dependence for the background field. This expression is remarkably similar
in form to Schwinger's classic result for the constant electric background.

terms of a Schr\""odinger-picture path integral, then a local expansion for (the
logarithm of the) VWF is used. The integral is regulated with an explicit
momentum cut-off, $\Lambda$. The resulting series is not expected to converge
for $\Lambda$ larger than the mass-gap but studying the domain of analyticity
of the VEVs allows us to use analytic continuation to estimate the
large-$\Lambda$ limit. Scalar theory in 1+1 dimensions is analyzed, where (as
in the case of Yang-Mills) we do not expect boundary divergences.

extracted from the IIB superstring effective action around the AdS5*S5
background. This is in line with the suggested AdS/Yang-Mills correspondence.
The relation between Yang--Mills instantons and D-instantons is further
confirmed by the explicit form of the classical D-instanton solution in the
AdS5*S5 background and its associated supermultiplet of zero modes.
Speculations are made concerning instanton effects in the large-N_c limit of
the SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory.
