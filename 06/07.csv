energy density of the current universe. One potential difficulty with this idea
is that couplings to ordinary matter, even if suppressed by the Planck scale,
should lead to observable long-range forces and time dependence of the
constants of nature. I explore the possibility that an approximate global
symmetry serves to suppress such couplings even further. Such a symmetry would
allow a coupling of $\phi$ to the pseudoscalar $F_{\mu\nu}\widetilde
F^{\mu\nu}$ of electromagnetism, which would rotate the polarization state of
radiation from distant sources. This effect is fairly well constrained, but it
is conceivable that future improvements could lead to a detection of a
cosmological scalar field.

cluster luminosity function (LF) and study the cluster white dwarfs (WDs). Our
photometry is offset by V = 0.052 (fainter) from Sandage (1962) and Eggen &
Sandage (1969). All published photometry for the past three decades have been
based on these two calibrations, which are in error by 0.05 +- 0.01. We employ
the Pinsonneault etal (1998) fiducial main sequence to derive a cluster
distance modulus of 11.43 +- 0.08. We report observations that are >= 50%
complete to V = 24.6 and find that the cluster central-field LF peaks at M_I ~
3 to 4. This is unlike the solar neighborhood LF and unlike the LFs of
dynamically unevolved portions of open and globular clusters, which rise
continuously until M_I ~ 9.5. Although we find that >= 50% of the unresolved
cluster objects are multiple systems, their presence cannot account for the
shape of the NGC 188 LF. For theoretical reasons (Terlevich 1987; Vesperini &
Heggie 1997) having to do with the survivability of NGC 188 we believe the
cluster is highly dynamically evolved and that the missing low luminosity stars
are either in the cluster outskirts or have left the cluster altogether. We
identify nine candidate WDs, of which we expect three to six are bona fide
cluster WDs. The luminosities of the faintest likely WD indicates an age
(Bergeron, Wesemael, & Beauchamp 1995) of 1.14 +- 0.09 Gyrs. This is a lower
limit to the cluster age and observations probing to V = 27 or 28 will be
necessary to find the faintest cluster WDs and independently determine the
cluster age. While our age limit is not surprising for this ~6 Gyr old cluster,
our result demonstrates the value of the WD age technique with its very low
internal errors. (abridged)

absorption lines (BALs) require extremely high metallicities and phosphorus
overabundances -- apparently in conflict with other abundance diagnostics. Here
I use HST spectroscopy of the BALQSO PG 1254+047 to argue that the BALs
abundance estimates are incorrect, because partial line-of-sight coverage of
the continuum source(s) has led to gross underestimates of the line optical
depths and column densities. I claim that the significant presence of PV
1118,1128 absorption in this and other BALQSOs identifies the saturated
absorption-line spectrum. This interpretation implies that the total column
densities are at least ten times larger than previous estimates, namely log
N_H(cm-2) > 22. The outflowing BAL gas, at velocities from -15,000 to -27,000
km/s in PG 1254+047, is therefore a strong candidate for the X-ray absorber in
BALQSOs. If this high-column density outflow is radiately accelerated, it must
originate <0.1 pc from the QSO.

two dual descriptions which apply in the Higgs and Coulomb phases of the theory

features seen on the macroscopic scale, in situations where the short--distance
scale at which the system's basic variables are defined is taken to zero. Among
the challenging questions are the construction of the limit, and the
explanation of some of the emergent properties, in particular the behavior
under conformal maps as discussed in [LPS 94]. A descriptive account of the
project, and some related open problems, is found in ref. [A] and in [AB]
(joint work with A. Burchard) where tools are developed for establishing a
curve--regularity condition which plays a key role in the construction of the
limit. The formulation of the scaling limit as a random Web measure permits to
formulate the question of uniqueness of measure(s) describing systems of random
curves satisfying the conditions of independence, Euclidean invariance, and
regularity. The uniqueness question remains open; progress on it could shed
light on the purported universality of critical behavior and the apparent
conformal invariance of the critical measures. The random Web yields also
another perspective on some of the equations of conformal field theory which
have appeared in this context, such as the equation proposed by J. Cardy [C].
