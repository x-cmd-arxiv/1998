parameter in a photoionized environment, and one of the most fundamental
physical quantities one can measure. We outline a method of determining
luminosity for any emission-line region using only infrared data. In dusty
environments, grains compete with hydrogen in absorbing continuum radiation.
Grains produce infrared emission, and hydrogen produces recombination lines. We
have computed a very large variety of photoionization models, using ranges of
abundances, grain mixtures, ionizing continua, densities, and ionization
parameters. The conditions were appropriate for such diverse objects as H II
regions, planetary nebulae, starburst galaxies, and the narrow and broad line
regions of active nuclei. The ratio of the total thermal grain emission
relative to H$\beta$ (IR/H$\beta$) is the primary indicator of whether the
cloud behaves as a classical Str\""{o}mgren sphere (a hydrogen-bounded nebula)
or whether grains absorb most of the incident continuum (a dust-bounded
nebula). We find two global limits: when $IR/H\beta<100$ infrared recombination
lines determine the source luminosity in ionizing photons; when
$IR/H\beta\gg100$ the grains act as a bolometer to measure the luminosity.

  C. M. Gaskell, W. N. Brandt, M. Dietrich, D. Dultzin-Hacyan, and M. Eracleous",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We describe the motivation and features of a multiwavelength spectroscopic
campaign on broad absorption line (BAL) QSO PG~0946+301. The main goal of this
project is to determine the ionization equilibrium and abundances (IEA) in BAL
outflows. Previous studies of IEA in BALQSOs were based on the assumption that
the BALs are not saturated so that the column densities inferred from the
apparent optical depths are realistic. This critical assumption is at odds with
several recent observations and with analysis of existing data which indicate
that the absorption troughs are heavily saturated even when they are not black.
In addition, X-ray observations, which are important for constraining the
ionizing continuum, were not available for those objects that had UV spectral
data. Quantifying the level of saturation in the BALs necessitates UV
spectroscopy with much higher S/N and broader spectral coverage than currently
exist. After taking into account the capabilities of available observatories,
our best hope for a substantial improvement in understanding the IEA in BALQSOs
is to concentrate considerable observational resources on the most promising
object. Our studies of available HST and ground-based spectra show that
PG~0946+301 is by far the best candidate for such a program. This BALQSO is at
least five times brighter, shortward of 1000 A rest frame, than any other
object, and due to its low redshift it has an especially sparse Lya forest. At
the same time PG~0946+301 is a typical BALQSO and therefore its IEA should be
representative. To this effect we are developing a multiwavelength
spectroscopic campaign (UV, FUV, X-ray and optical) on BALQSO PG 0946+301. We
discuss the goals and feasibility of each observational component: HST, FUSE,
ASCA and ground-based.

requiring that the dwarf galaxy is sufficiently robust to survive tidal

interaction are compromised in our simulations by the lack of a live Galactic
halo, we find that for model masses > 5x10^9 M_Sun, prominent spiral arms and a
substantial lopsidedness in the outer disk are produced. Furthermore, a
noticeable warp-like structure is induced in the disk. Thus the Sgr dwarf may
have significantly affected the star formation history and structure of the

accretion flow and turbulence. We adopt the Novikov and Thorne (1973) solution,
and find that within this framework, turbulent broadening is the dominant new
effect. The most prominent change in the skewed, double-horned line profiles is
a substantial reduction in the maximum flux at both red and blue peaks. The
effect is most pronounced when the inclination angle is large, and when the
accretion rate is high. Thus, the effects discussed here may be important for
future detailed modeling of high quality observational data.

at different times from an evolving self-consistent model galaxy consisting of
a two-component disk (stars+gas) and a live halo. The results are compared with
a pure stellar model, subject to nearly identical initial conditions, which are
chosen as to make the models develop a large scale stellar bar. The bars are
also subject to hose-pipe (buckling) instability which modifies the vertical
structure of the disk. The diverging morphological evolution of both models is
explained in terms of gas radial inflow, the resulting change in the
gravitational potential at smaller radii, and the subsequent modification of
the main families of orbits, both in and out of the disk plane.
  We find that dynamical instabilities become milder in the presence of the gas
component, and that the stability of planar and 3D stellar orbits is strongly
affected by the related changes in the potential -- both are destabilized with
the gas accumulation at the center. This is reflected in the overall lower
amplitude of the bar mode and in the substantial weakening of the bar, which
appears to be a gradual process. The vertical buckling of the bar is much less
pronounced and the characteristic peanut shape of the galactic bulge almost
disappears when there is a substantial gas inflow towards the center. Milder
instability results in a smaller bulge whose basic parameters are in agreement
with observations. We also find that the overall evolution in the model with a
gas component is accelerated due to the larger central mass concentration and
resulting decrease in the characteristic dynamical time.

absorption systems are the same as observed in the DLA system, we find that the
observed N(CIV)/N(MgII) ratios imply ionization parameters of log\Gamma=-2.95
to -2.35. Consequently, these clouds should be small (0.5-1.6 kpc with a
hydrogen density n_H<=0.01 cm-3) and relatively highly ionized. The absorption
systems to B are found to have a metallicity 0.63 times lower than the

which OVI, but only weak CIV absorption occurs. In this state, log\Gamma>=-1.2

particles in a two-dimensional, doubly periodic domain. The probability
distribution function of vortex velocity, p_N, has a slow-velocity Gaussian
component and a significant high-velocity tail caused by close vortex pairs. In
the limit for N -> oo, p_N tends to a Gaussian. However, the form of the
single-vortex velocity causes very slow convergence with N; for N ~ 10^6 the
non-Gaussian high-velocity tails still play a significant role. At finite N,
the Gaussian component is well modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic
process with variance sigma_N = sqrt{N ln N /2 pi}. Considering in detail the
case N=100, we show that at short times the velocity autocorrelation is
dominated by the Gaussian component and displays an exponential decay with a
short Lagrangian decorrelation time. The close pairs have a long correlation
time and cause nonergodicity over at least the time of the integration. Due to
close vortex dipoles the absolute dispersion differs significantly from the OU
prediction, and shows evidence of long-time anomalous dispersion. We discuss
the mathematical form of a new stochastic model for the Lagrangian dynamics,
consisting of an OU model combined with long-lived close same-sign vortices
engaged in rapid rotation and long-lived close dipoles engaged in ballistic
motion. From a dynamical-systems perspective this work indicates that systems
of dimension O(100) can have behavior which is a combination of both
low-dimensional behavior, i.e. close pairs, and extremely high-dimensional

Vol. 5, 271 (1998)",,,"cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio",,"  Two headed motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, hidrolyze
environmental ATP in order to propel unidirectionally along cytoskeletal
filaments such as microtubules. In the case of kinesin, protein heads bind
primarily on the alpha tubulin site of asymmetric alpha-beta 8nm-long tubulin
dimers that constitute the microtubular protofilaments. Kinesin dimers overcome
local binding forces up to 5pN and are known to move on protofilaments with ATP
concentration-dependent speeds while hydrolizing on average one ATP molecule
per 8nm step. The salient features of protein trajectories are the distinct
abrupt usually 8nm-long steps from one tubulin dimer to the next interlaced
with long quiescent binding periods at a tubulin site. Discrete walks of this
type are characterized by substantially reduced variances compared to pure
biased random walks, and as a result rule out flashing-type ratchet models as
possible mechanisms for motor movement. On the other hand, simple additive
correlated brownian ratchets that present exactly these discrete trajectory
patterns with reduced variances are compatible with the general features of
protein motion. In the simplest such model the protein is simplified to a
single particle moving in a periodic non-symmetric tubulin-derived potential
and the environmental and ATP interaction is included in a correlated additive
noise term. For this model we show that the resulting protein walk has features
resembling experimental data. Furthermore, in more realistic mechanical models
of two masses connected by a spring we find qualitative agreement with recent
experimental facts related to motion of protein chimaeras formed through
kinesin motor domains with non-claret disjunctional (ncd) neck regions.

On a short time scale this traditional separation does not seem to be

participants are professional traders and cannot be separated into ""smart"" and

of these solutions that was begun in a Physical Review Letter, and supplies
complete proofs. We identify a physically interesting subclass where the Ernst
potential is everywhere regular except at a closed surface which might be
identified with the surface of a body of revolution. The corresponding
spacetimes are asymptotically flat and equatorially symmetric. This suggests
that they could describe the exterior of an isolated body, for instance a
relativistic star or a galaxy. Within this class, one has the freedom to
specify a real function and a set of complex parameters which can possibly be
used to solve certain boundary value problems for the Ernst equation. The
solutions can have ergoregions, a Minkowskian limit and an ultrarelativistic
limit where the metric approaches the extreme Kerr solution. We give explicit
formulae for the potential on the axis and in the equatorial plane where the
expressions simplify. Special attention is paid to the simplest non-static

  The primordial spectrum must be sufficiently flat at low frequency and
sufficiently steeper at high frequency. For a steep and/or long enough
high-frequency branch of the spectrum the bounds imposed by COBE's
normalization allow axion masses of the typical order for a
Peccei--Quinn--Weinberg--Wilczek axion. We provide a particular example in
which an appropriate axion spectrum is obtained from a class of backgrounds
satisfying the low-energy string cosmology equations.

sound velocity of the stiff plasma governing the evolution of the geometry. The
duration of the stiff phase is crucially determined by the backreaction of the
GW leaving the horizon during the de Sitter phase and re-entering during the
stiff phase. Therefore, the maximal (inflationary) curvature scale has to be
fine-tuned to a value smaller than the limits set by the large scale
measurements ($H_{dS}\laq 10^{-6}~M_{P}$) in order to a have a sufficiently
long stiff phase reaching an energy scale of the order of the $1~{\rm TeV}$ and
even lower if we want the stiff phase to touch the hadronic era (corresponding
to $T_{had}\sim 140~{\rm MeV}$). By looking more positively at our exercise we
see that, if an inflationary phase is followed by a stiff phase, there exist an
appealing possibility of ""graviton reheating"" whose effective temperature can
be generally quite low.

Copenhagen vacuum). We argue that this spontaneous instability does not occur
at high temperature when the induced field strength gB ~ Lambda^2 is much
weaker than the magnetic mass squared (g^2T)^2. At high temperature
oscillations of gauge fields acquire a thermal mass M ~ gT and we show that
this mass stabilizes a magnetic field which is constant over length scales
shorter than the magnetic screening length (g^2T)^{-1}. We therefore conclude
that there is no indication for any spontaneous generation of weak non-abelian
magnetic fields in the early universe.

radii, magnetic and quadrupole moments, and decay widths of the light vector
mesons rho^+, K^{*+} and K^{*0} are calculated in a Lorentz-covariant,
Dyson-Schwinger equation based model using algebraic quark propagators that
incorporate confinement, asymptotic freedom, and dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking, and vector meson Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes closely related to the
pseudoscalar amplitudes obtained from phenomenological studies of pi and K
mesons. Calculated static properties of vector mesons include the charge radii
and magnetic moments: r_{rho+} = 0.61 fm, r_{K*+} = 0.54 fm, and r^2_{K*0} =
-0.048 fm^2; mu_{rho+} = 2.69, mu_{K*+} = 2.37, and mu_{K*0} = -0.40. The
calculated static limits of the rho-meson form factors are similar to those
obtained from light-front quantum mechanical calculations, but begin to differ
above q^2 = 1 GeV^2 due to the dynamical evolution of the quark propagators in
our approach.

and collaborators (called R/W in short) and those based on Brown-Rho scaling
(called B/R), as applied to reproduce the dileptons measured by the CERES
collaboration in the CERN experiments. In both theories the large number of
dileptons at invariant masses $\sim$~$m_\rho/2$ are shown to be chiefly
produced by a density-dependent $\rho$-meson mass. In R/W the medium dependence
is dynamically calculated using hadronic variables defined in the matter-free
vacuum. In B/R scaling it follows from movement towards chiral symmetry
restoration due to medium-induced vacuum change, and is described in terms of
constituent (or quasiparticle) quarks. We argue that the R/W description should
be reliable up to densities somewhat beyond nuclear density, where hadrons are
the effective variables. At higher density there should be a crossover to
constituent quarks as effective variables scaling according to B/R. In the
crossover region, the two descriptions must be ``dual''.

two, dense systems for which fluctuations are treated on top of the ""vacuum""
defined at a given density, with masses and coupling constants varying as
function of matter density (""Brown-Rho scaling""). Based on an intricate -- as
yet mostly conjectural -- connection between the in-medium structure of chiral
Lagrangian field theory which is a beautiful effective theory of QCD and that
of Landau Fermi liquid theory which is an equally beautiful and highly
successful effective theory of many-body systems, it is suggested that a chiral
Lagrangian with Brown-Rho scaling in the mean field is equivalent to
Fermi-liquid fixed point theory. I make this connection using electroweak and
strong responses of nuclear matter up to nuclear matter density and then
extrapolating to higher densities encountered in heavy-ion collisions and
compact stars.

analytic as well as numerical work is based on a reaction-diffusion model of
this reaction. We focus on the role of initial density fluctuations in the
creation of the macroscopic patterns that lead to the well-known kinetic
anomalies in this system. In particular, we discuss the role of the long
wavelength components of the initial fluctuations in determining the long-time
behavior of the system. We note that the frequently studied random initial
distribution is but one of a variety of possible distributions leading to
interesting anomalous behavior. Our discussion includes an initial distribution
with correlated A-B pairs and one in which the initial distribution forms a
fractal pattern. The former is an example of a distribution whose long
wavelength components are suppressed, while the latter exemplifies one whose
long wavelength components are enhanced, relative to those of the random
distribution.

DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included in various curricula. An
alternative introduction to DFT is presented here, drawing on ideas which are
well-known from thermodynamics, especially the idea of switching between
different independent variables. The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that
it is possible and beneficial to replace the dependence on the external
potential v(r) by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented
as a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform from the
chemical potential (\mu) to the number of particles (N). This approach is used
here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional and to obtain the
corresponding theorems, using classical nonuniform fluids as simple examples.
The energy functional for electronic systems is considered next, and the
Kohn-Sham equations are derived. The exchange-correlation part of this
functional is discussed, including both the local density approximation to it,
and its formally exact expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A
very brief survey of various applications and extensions is included.
