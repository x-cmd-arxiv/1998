According to the commonly acceptable phasing of the binary cycle, the
systematically varying minimum corresponds to inferior conjunction of the red

redshifts from observations using a small number of broad-band filters.
However, the accuracy with which redshifts can be determined is sensitive to
the star formation history of the galaxy, for example the effects of age,
metallicity and on-going star formation. We present a photometric classifier
that explicitly takes into account the degeneracies implied by these
variations, based on the flexible stellar population synthesis code of Kodama &
Arimoto. The situation is encouraging since many of the variations in stellar
populations introduce colour changes that are degenerate. We use a Bayesian
inversion scheme to estimate the likely range of redshifts compatible with the
observed colours. When applied to existing multi-band photometry for Abell 370,
most of the cluster members are correctly recovered with little field
contamination. The inverter is focussed on the recovery of a wide variety of
galaxy populations in distant (z~1) clusters from broad band colours covering
the 4000 angstrom break. It is found that this can be achieved with impressive
accuracy ($|\Delta z| < 0.1$), allowing detailed investigation into the

The new algorithm will become essential when comparing the observational
results of the next generation of CMB experiments with theoretical predictions.
The parameter space of the models is so large that an exhaustive exploration to
find the best fit model will only be feasible with this new type of algorithm.
We also investigate the polarization properties of the CMB field. We develop a
new formalism to describe the statistics of the polarization variables that
takes into account their spin two nature (Chapter 2). In Chapter 4 we explore
several physical effects that create distinct features in the polarization
power spectrum. We study the signature of the reionization of the universe and
a stochastic background of gravitational waves. We also describe how the
polarization correlation functions can be used to test the causal structure of
the universe. Finally in Chapter 5 we quantify the amount of information the
next generation of satellites can obtain by measuring both temperature and
polarization anisotropies. We calculate the expected error bars on the
cosmological parameters for the specifications of the MAP and Planck satellite
missions.

the redshift interval 0.0 to \sim 1.5 based upon a sample of 987 lines
identified in the spectra of 63 QSOs obtained with the Faint Object
Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. Fits to the number of absorbers per
unit redshift dN/dz = A \times (1+z)^\gamma yield values of \gamma in the range
0.1 to 0.3, decidedly flatter than results from groundbased data pertaining to
the redshift range z > 1.7. The combination of the space and groundbased data
suggest a marked transition in the rate of evolution of the Ly alpha lines at a
redshift of about 1.7. The distribution in redshift is well represented by a
power law and the distribution of equivalent widths above a rest equivalent
width of 0.1 \AA is fit well by an exponential. The sample of Ly alpha systems
which has ions from heavy elements has a much larger value of \gamma than a
sample of lines of comparable strength without heavy elements. We argue that
this is not likely due to either line misidentification or incomplete spectral
coverage and suggest that it is due to rapid evolution of the very highest
column density systems, rather than differences in metallicity. We also find
evidence that the rate of evolution increases with increasing equivalent width.
We compare our results for the variation of line density with redshift to
recent numerical simulations of Ly alpha absorbers, and find fairly good
agreement. Our results for the stronger Ly alpha lines in our sample are
compatible with the recent analysis of the absorber--galaxy correlation by Chen
et al. 1998 but for the weaker lines our results suggest that the association
between absorbers and galaxies is different from that for the stronger lines.

  includes analysis of lensing due to matter continuously distributed in
  galaxies","Astrophys. J. 506 (1998) L1","10.1086/311631",,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  Gravitational lensing causes the distribution of observed brightnesses of
standard candles at a given redshift to be highly non-gaussian. The
distribution is strongly, and asymmetrically, peaked at a value less than the
expected value in a homogeneous Robertson-Walker universe. Therefore, given any
small sample of observations in an inhomogeneous universe, the most likely
observed luminosity is at flux values less than the Robertson-Walker value.
This paper explores the impact of this systematic error due to lensing upon
surveys predicated on measuring standard candle brightnesses. We re-analyze
recent results from the high-z supernova team (Riess et al. 1998), both when
most of the matter in the universe is in the form of compact objects
(represented by the empty-beam expression, corresponding to the maximal case of
lensing), and when the matter is continuously distributed in galaxies. We find
that the best-fit model remains unchanged (at Omega_m=0, Omega_Lambda=0.45),
but the confidence contours change size and shape, becoming larger (and thus
allowing a broader range of parameter space) and dropping towards higher values
of matter density, Omega_m (or correspondingly, lower values of the
cosmological constant, Omega_Lambda). These effects are slight when the matter
is continuously distributed. However, the effects become considerably more
important if most of the matter is in compact objects. For example, neglecting
lensing, the Omega_m=0.5, Omega_Lambda=0.5 model is more than 2 sigma away from
the best fit. In the empty-beam analysis, this cosmology is at 1 sigma.

(\delta/\delta^*)^2$ with $\delta^*=J/t$ (the ratio of typical exchange to
hopping). In the ``quantum critical regime'' $\epsilon_F^*<T<J$, several
physical quantities display Marginal Fermi Liquid behaviour : NMR relaxation
time $1/T_1\sim const.$, resistivity $\rho_{dc}(T) \propto T$, optical lifetime
$\tau_{opt}^{-1}\propto \omega/\ln(\omega/\epstar)$ and response functions obey
$\omega/T$ scaling, e.g. $J\sum_q \chi''(q,\omega) \propto \tanh (\omega/2T)$.

liquid theory in this regime with a $\sqrt{\omega}$ dependence of the inverse
single-particle lifetime and a $1/\sqrt{\omega}$ decay of the photoemission
intensity. On the basis of this model and of various experimental evidence, it
is argued that the proximity of a quantum critical point separating a glassy
Mott-Anderson insulator from a metallic ground-state is an important ingredient
in the physics of the normal state of cuprate superconductors (particularly the
Zn-doped materials). In this picture the corresponding quantum critical regime
is a ``slushy'' state of spins and holes with slow spin and charge dynamics

vertex corrections. In particular, satellite peaks are systematically broadened

say that torsion should play an important role in quantum gravity in the
formation of bubbles of spacetime foam. On the basis of the algebraic relation
between torsion and the classical spinor field in Einstein-Cartan gravity the
geometrical interpretation of the spinor field is considered as ``the square

of all flavors over several seconds, with average energies of 10--25 MeV. In
the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), which begins operations this year,
neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors can be detected by reactions which
break up the deuteron. For a future Galactic supernova at a distance of 10 kpc,
several hundred events will be observed in SNO. The $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$
neutrinos and antineutrinos are of particular interest, as a test of the
supernova mechanism. In addition, it is possible to measure or limit their
masses by their delay (determined from neutral-current events) relative to the
$\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos (determined from charged-current events). Numerical
results are presented for such a future supernova as seen in SNO. Under
reasonable assumptions, and in the presence of the expected counting
statistics, a $\nu_\mu$ or $\nu_\tau$ mass down to about 30 eV can be simply
and robustly determined. If zero delay is measured, then the mass limit is
independent of the distance $D$. At present, this seems to be the best
possibility for direct determination of a $\nu_\mu$ or $\nu_\tau$ mass within
the cosmologically interesting range. We also show how to separately study the
supernova and neutrino physics, and how changes in the assumed supernova
parameters would affect the mass sensitivity.

Rajaraman, we find that these terms vanish in Matrix theory. We show that the
absence of these terms is compatible with the classical supergravity theory
when the theory is compactified in a lightlike direction, resolving an apparent
discrepancy between the two theories. A brief discussion is given of how this
calculation might be generalized to compare the Matrix theory and supergravity
descriptions of an arbitrary 3-body system.

the worldvolume action as well as the target space solution. The worldvolume
action is given by a gauged sigma model which, via dimensional reduction and
duality, is shown to be related to the worldvolume actions of the branes of
ten- dimensional superstring theory. The effective tension of the M-9-brane
scales as (R_{11})^3, where R_{11} is the radius of an S^1-isometry direction.
This isometry enables us to add a cosmological constant to eleven-dimensional
supergravity. The target space solution corresponding to the M-9-brane is a
(wrapped) domain wall of massive eleven-dimensional supergravity. This solution
breaks half of the bulk supersymmetry. We consider both single M-9-branes as
well as a system of two M-9-branes. In both cases one can define regions in
spacetime, separated by the domain walls, with zero cosmological constant. In
these regions the limit R_{11}-> \infty can be taken in which case the
M-9-brane is unwrapped and a massless eleven-dimensional supergravity is
obtained.

studied with the aim of investigating velocity correlations between particles.
Two effects lead to such correlations: inelastic collisions help to build
localized correlations, while momentum conservation and diffusion produce long
ranged correlations. In the quasi-elastic limit, the velocity correlation is
weak, but it is still important since it is of the same order as the deviation
from uniformity. For system with stronger inelasticity, the pipe contains a
clump of particles in highly correlated motion. A theory with empirical
parameters is developed. This theory is composed of equations similar to the
usual hydrodynamic laws of conservation of particles, energy, and momentum.
Numerical results show that the theory describes the dynamics satisfactorily in
the quasi-elastic limit, however only qualitatively for stronger inelasticity.
