that these events come from Gpc distances and are the most powerful photon
emitters known in the Universe, with peak luminosities up to 10^52 erg/s. We
here report the discovery of an optical transient, in the BeppoSAX Wide Field
Camera error box of GRB980425, which occurred within about a day of the
gamma-ray burst. Its optical light curve, spectrum and location in a spiral arm
of the galaxy ESO 184-G82, at a redshift z = 0.0085, show that the transient is
a very luminous type Ic supernova, SN1998bw. The peculiar nature of SN1998bw is
emphasized by its extraordinary radio properties which require that the radio
emitter expand at relativistical speed. Since SN1998bw is very different from
all previously observed afterglows of GRBs, our discovery raises the
possibility that very different mechanisms may give rise to GRBs, which differ
little in their gamma-ray properties.

consideration of the systematic uncertainties of SNe Ia as standard candles, in

luminosities by adding weak lensing noise (using empirical fitting formulae)
and scatter in SN Ia absolute magnitudes to standard candles placed at random
redshifts. We show that flux-averaging is powerful in reducing the combined
noise due to gravitational lensing and scatter in SN Ia absolute magnitudes.
The SN number count is not sensitive to matter distribution in the universe; it
can be used to test models of cosmology or to measure the SN rate. The SN
pencil beam survey can yield a wealth of data which should enable accurate
determination of the cosmological parameters and the SN rate, and provide
valuable information on the formation and evolution of galaxies.
  The SN pencil beam survey can be accomplished on a dedicated 4 meter
telescope with a square degree field of view. This telescope can be used to
conduct other important observational projects compatible with the SN pencil

the mean star formation history of the universe. When accurately known, the
cosmic star formation rate could provide much information about Galactic
evolution, if the Milky Way's star formation rate is representative of the
average cosmic star formation history. A simple hypothesis is that our local
star formation rate is proportional to the cosmic mean. In addition, to specify
a star formation history, one must also adopt an initial mass function (IMF);
typically it is assumed that the IMF is a smooth function which is constant in
time. We show how to test directly the compatibility of all these assumptions,
by making use of the local (solar neighborhood) star formation record encoded
in the present-day stellar mass function. Present data suggests that at least
one of the following is false: (1) the local IMF is constant in time; (2) the
local IMF is a smooth (unimodal) function; and/or (3) star formation in the
Galactic disk was representative of the cosmic mean. We briefly discuss how to
determine which of these assumptions fail, and improvements in observations
which will sharpen this test.

dynamics we consider a model of the von K\'arm\'an vortex street, a time

that a fractal unstable manifold acts as a catalyst for the process, and the
products cover fattened-up copies of this manifold. This may account for the
observed filamental intensification of activity in environmental flows. The
reaction equations valid in the wake are derived either in the form of
dissipative maps or differential equations depending on the regime under
consideration. They contain terms that are not present in the traditional
reaction equations of the same active process: the decay of the products is
slower while the productivity is much faster than in homogeneous flows. Both
effects appear as a consequence of underlying fractal structures. In the long
time limit, the system locks itself in a dynamic equilibrium state synchronized
to the flow for both types of reactions. For particles of finite size an
emptying transition might also occur leading to no products left in the wake.

non-equilibrium state. An interesting phase transition, controlled by the drift
away from the trap, takes place: from a non-trivial steady state, when the
drift is weak, to a trivial steady state (the vacuum), as the drift increases
beyond some critical point. Surprisingly, regardless of the drift strength, the
computed IPDF resembles that of an homogeneous equilibrium system, without the
trap. We suggest that this is due to ""shielding"": the particle nearest to the

LEP, LEP2 and RunI Tevatron experimental searches for excess events in the jets

length of the gluino in the detector, the amount of energy it deposits in each
hadronic collision, and the probability for the gluino to fragment to a
pseudo-stable charged hadron after a given hadronic collision. We explore how
the range of excluded gluino mass depends upon these ingredients, concluding
that for non-extreme cases the range $3\gev\lsim\mgl\lsim 130-150\gev$ can be

bosonic particle system with two-body $\delta$-function interaction with the
reversed role of strong and weak couplings.

to the same results as the standard first quantization of this system. For
this, the diffusion constant governing the process has to be proportional to
\alpha ', the Regge slope parameter, which is the only constant, along with the
velocity of light, needed to describe the motion of a string.

"quant-ph/9806045","Peter David Drummond","P.D. Drummond and M. Hillery","Quantum theory of dispersive electromagnetic modes",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.59.691",,"quant-ph",,"  A quantum theory of dispersion for an inhomogeneous solid is obtained, from a
starting point of multipolar coupled atoms interacting with an electromagnetic
field. The dispersion relations obtained are equivalent to the standard
classical Sellmeir equations obtained from the Drude-Lorentz model. In the
homogeneous (plane-wave) case, we obtain the detailed quantum mode structure of
the coupled polariton fields, and show that the mode expansion in all branches
of the dispersion relation is completely defined by the refractive index and
the group-velocity for the polaritons. We demonstrate a straightforward
procedure for exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in one, two or
three-dimensional environments, even in the presence of longitudinal
phonon-exciton dispersion, and an arbitrary number of resonant transitions with
different frequencies. This is essential, since it is necessary to include at
least one phonon (I.R.) and one exciton (U.V.) mode, in order to accurately
represent dispersion in transparent solid media. Our method of diagonalization
does not require an explicit solution of the dispersion relation, but relies
instead on the analytic properties of Cauchy contour integrals over all
possible mode frequencies. When there is longitudinal phonon dispersion, the
relevant group-velocity term is modified so that it only includes the purely
electromagnetic part of the group velocity.

quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\""odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  In this third part of our series we investigate the bundle analogues of the
conventional pictures of motion. In particular, there are found the state
sections and bundle morphisms corresponding to state vectors and observables
respectively. The equations of motion for these quantities are derived too.
Using the results obtained, we consider from the bundle view-point problems
concerning the integrals of motion. An invariant (bundle) necessary and
sufficient conditions for a dynamical variable to be an integral of motion are
found.
