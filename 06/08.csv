subsequent gravitational lensing of the CMB disturbs its Gaussianity. Knowledge
of the specific signature of lensing is necessary to distinguish a lensed
Gaussian sky from an intrinsically non-Gaussian one. In this paper we
investigate the pattern of non-Gaussian features in the CMB resulting from
gravitational lensing, both analytically and numerically. We describe the
lensed CMB temperature distribution using the formalism of generating
functionals and obtain the complete picture of emerging non-Gaussian effects.
To test for the signature of lensing in practice, we propose a scale-dependent
statistic based on cumulants of the CMB temperature, and we compute that
statistic numerically for typical inflationary models. The effect is expected
to be most significant at angular scales $\sim 10^\prime$ and its magnitude is
within observational capabilities of future satellite missions.

formed in clusters of galaxies.
  We here propose that the major mechanism for the S0 creation is galaxy
merging between two spirals with unequal mass.
  Our numerical simulations demonstrate that galaxy merging exhausts a large
amount of interstellar medium of two gas-rich spirals owing to the moderately
enhanced star formation, and subsequently transforms the two into one gas-poor
S0 galaxy with structure and kinematics strikingly similar to the observed
ones.
  This secondary S0 formation with enhanced star formation explains a smaller
fraction of S0 population recently observed in some distant clusters of
galaxies.
  Unequal-mass galaxy mergers thus provide an evolutionary link between a
larger number of blue spirals observed in intermediate redshift clusters and
red S0s prevalent in the present-day ones.

compact. They have sizes (from less than 100 pc to a few hundred pc) much
smaller and closer to the nucleus than that seen in the prototype Seyfert 2

the estimated bolometric luminosities of their obscured Seyfert 1 nuclei, and
thus they contribute in the same amount to the overall energetics of these

  Our trail formation model includes an equation of motion, an equation for

functions, which are specified according to the characteristics of the
considered animals or pedestrians. Not only the kind of environmental changes
differs: Whereas pedestrians leave footprints on the ground, ants produce
chemical markings for their orientation. Nevertheless, it is more important
that pedestrians steer towards a certain destination, while ants usually find
their food sources by chance, i.e. they reach their destination in a stochastic
way. As a consequence, the typical structure of the evolving trail systems
depends on the respective species. Some ant species produce a dendritic trail
system, whereas pedestrians generate a minimal detour system.
  The trail formation model can be used as a tool for the optimization of
pedestrian facilities: It allows urban planners to design convenient way

temperature and energy are complementary in the same way as position and
momentum in quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking, their idea was that a definite
temperature can be attributed to a system only if it is submerged in a heat
bath, in which case energy fluctuations are unavoidable. On the other hand, a
definite energy can only be assigned to systems in thermal isolation, thus
excluding the simultaneous determination of its temperature.
  Rosenfeld extended this analogy with quantum mechanics and obtained a
quantitative uncertainty relation in the form (Delta U) (Delta (1/T)) >= k
where k is Boltzmann's constant. The two `extreme' cases of this relation would
then characterize this complementarity between isolation (U definite) and
contact with a heat bath (T definite). Other formulations of the
thermodynamical uncertainty relations were proposed by Mandelbrot (1956, 1989),
Lindhard (1986) and Lavenda (1987, 1991). This work, however, has not led to a
consensus in the literature.
  It is shown here that the uncertainty relation for temperature and energy in
the version of Mandelbrot is indeed exactly analogous to modern formulations of
the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. However, his relation holds only
for the canonical distribution, describing a system in contact with a heat
bath. There is, therefore, no complementarity between this situation and a
thermally isolated system.

that are slightly larger than the one-loop results. Accurate knowledge of these
functions is needed for testing the renormalization-group prediction of
critical-point universality along the \lambda-line of superfluid He(4).
Combining the three-loop result for F- with a recent five-loop calculation of
the additive renormalization constant of the specific heat yields excellent
agreement between the calculated and measured universal amplitude ratio A+/A-
of the specific heat of He(4). In addition we use our result for f_phi to
calculate the universal combination R_C of the amplitudes of the order
parameter, the susceptibility and the specific heat for n=2 and n=3. Our
Borel-resummed three-loop result for R_C is significantly more accurate than
the previous result obtained from the \epsilon-expansion up to O(\epsilon^2).

  Function for Graphs","AMSTeX, to appear in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc",,,,"math.CO",,"  We derive combinatorial proofs of the main two evaluations of the
Ihara-Selberg Zeta function associated with a graph. We give three proofs of
the first evaluation all based on the algebra of Lyndon words. In the third
proof it is shown that the first evaluation is an immediate consequence of
Amitsur's identity on the characteristic polynomial of a sum of matrices. The
second evaluation of the Ihara-Selberg Zeta function is first derived by means
of a sign-changing involution technique. Our second approach makes use of a
short matrix-algebra argument.

representation of Gal$(M/Q)$ with an upper triangular image, where $M$ is the
maximal abelian pro-$p$-extension of $F_{\infty}$ unramified outside a finite
set of places S, $F_{\infty}$ being a free pro-$p$-extension of a subextension
$F$ of the field $K$ fixed by the kernel of the representation. We establish a
link between the latter universal deformation ring and the universal
deformation ring of the representation of Gal$(K_S/Q)$, where $K_S$ is the
maximal pro-$p$-extension of $K$ unramified outside $S$. We then give some
examples.

$N^{*}$(1440) resonance is developed based on an effective Lagrangian of
baryons interacting through mesons.
  The equation is consistent with that of nucleon's and delta's which we
derived before. Thus, we obtain a set of coupled equations for the $N$,
$\Delta$ and $N^{*}$(1440) distribution functions.
  All the $N^{*}$(1440)-relevant in-medium two-body scattering cross sections
within the $N$, $\Delta$ and $N^{*}$(1440) system are derived from the same
effective Lagrangian in addition to the mean field and presented analytically.
Medium effects on the cross sections are discussed.

Assembly Lifecycles) project is delivering a software system to facilitate the
management of the engineering data collected at each stage of production of
CMS. CRISTAL captures all the physical characteristics of CMS components as
each sub-detector is tested and assembled. These data are retained for later
use in areas such as detector slow control, calibration and maintenance.
CRISTAL must, therefore, support different views onto its data dependent on the
role of the user. These data viewpoints are investigated in this paper. In the
recent past two CMS Notes have been written about CRISTAL. The first note, CMS
1996/003, detailed the requirements for CRISTAL, its relationship to other CMS
software, its objectives and reviewed the technology on which it would be
based. CMS 1997/104 explained some important design concepts on which CRISTAL
is and showed how CRISTAL integrated the domains of product data man- agement
and workflow management. This note explains, through the use of diagrams, how
CRISTAL can be established for detector production and used as the information
source for analyses, such as calibration and slow controls, carried out by
physicists. The reader should consult the earlier CMS Notes and conference
papers for technical detail on CRISTAL - this note concentrates on issues
surrounding the practical use of the CRISTAL software.

classical continuous system. The fractal dimension of geometrical sets was
introduced by Mandelbrot as a new criterion to analyze the complexity of these
sets. The Epsilon-entropy and the fractal dimension of a state in general
quantum system were introduced by one of the present authors in order to
characterize chaotic properties of general states.
  In this paper, we show that Epsilon-entropy of a state includes Kolmogorov
Epsilon-entropy, and the fractal dimension of a state describe fractal
structure of Gaussian measures.

A connection, as well as a metric on state space, can be obtained from a metric
on the purification space. We include a condition, with which this
correspondence becomes one-to-one. Our methods are borrowed from elementary
*-representation and fibre space theory. We lift, as an example, solutions of a
von Neumann equation, write down holonomy invariants for cyclic ones, and ``add
noise'' to a curve of pure states.

  Symposium on Theory of Computation (STOC)'', pages 20-30, 1997",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We define the model of quantum circuits with density matrices, where
non-unitary gates are allowed. Measurements in the middle of the computation,
noise and decoherence are implemented in a natural way in this model, which is
shown to be equivalent in computational power to standard quantum circuits.
  The main result in this paper is a solution for the subroutine problem: The
general function that a quantum circuit outputs is a probabilistic function,
but using pure state language, such a function can not be used as a black box
in other computations. We give a natural definition of using general
subroutines, and analyze their computational power.
  We suggest convenient metrics for quantum computing with mixed states. For
density matrices we analyze the so called ``trace metric'', and using this
metric, we define and discuss the ``diamond metric'' on superoperators. These
metrics enable a formal discussion of errors in the computation.
  Using a ``causality'' lemma for density matrices, we also prove a simple
lower bound for probabilistic functions.
