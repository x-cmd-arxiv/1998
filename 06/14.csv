Vega-like star HR 4796A. Images of the thermal dust emission at $\lambda = 18
\mu$m show an elongated structure approximately 200 AU in diameter surrounding
the central A0V star. The position angle of the disk, $30^{\circ} \pm
10^{\circ}$, is consistent to the position angle of the M companion star,
$225^{\circ}$, suggesting that the disk-binary system is being seen nearly
along its orbital plane. The surface brightness distribution of the disk is
consistent with the presence of an inner disk hole of approximately 50 AU
radius, as was originally suggested by Jura et al. on the basis of the infrared
spectrum. HR 4796 is a unique system among the Vega-like or $\beta$ Pictoris
stars in that the M star companion (a weak-emission T Tauri star) shows that
the system is relatively young, $\sim 8 \pm 3$ Myr. The inner disk hole may
provide evidence for coagulation of dust into larger bodies on a timescale
similar to that suggested for planet formation in the solar system.

we obtain a good fit to a Schechter function with $H^*=11.13$ and
$\alpha=-0.78$. These luminosity function parameters are similar to those
measured for field galaxies in the infrared, which is surprising considering
the very different environmental densities and, presumably, merger histories
for field galaxies. For fainter galaxies, we use two independent techniques to
correct for field galaxy contamination in the cluster population: the $B-R$
color-magnitude relation and an estimate for the level of background and
foreground contamination from the literature. Using either method we find a
steep upturn for galaxies with $14 < H < 16$, with slope $\alpha \simeq 1.7$.

continuum is the integrated light from the host galaxy, which does not affect
the UV continuum. Therefore, we expect any curvature in a linear plot of the UV
continuum flux versus the simultaneous optical flux to represent a true change
in the spectral index alpha; the y-intercept provides an estimate of the host
galaxy contribution in the optical region. We measured the continuum fluxes at
1350A (rest frame) from the NEWSIPS-extracted spectra and adopted the optical
continuum determinations of Wanders & Peterson (1996). The data confirm that
the curvature in the F_{lambda}(5100) -- F_{lambda}(1350) plot is real, and
that the spectral index is a function of luminosity. Hence for NGC 5548, the
continuum does get harder as it gets brighter. However, the relationship
between the optical and UV continuum flux is more complicated than the models

  The study of these star formation histories is a multi-parameter problem:
Ages, metallicities, population fractions, and spatial variations must be
determined, which depend crucially on the knowledge of reddening and distance.
  Even the lowest-mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies can show significant spatial
variations in star formation, ages, and metallicities. All Local Group dwarf

their subpopulations even within the same morphological type. Star formation

the fluid behind the shock. Using this detailed model, we derive expressions

measuring cosmological parameters, such as regression of light versus mass, the
analysis of redshift distortions, measures involving skewness and the cosmic
virial theorem. The common linear and deterministic relation g=b*d between the
density fluctuation fields of galaxies g and mass d is replaced by the
conditional distribution P(g|d) of these random fields, smoothed at a given
scale at a given time. The nonlinearity is characterized by the conditional
mean <g|d>=b(d)*d, while the local scatter is represented by the conditional
variance s_b^2(d) and higher moments. The scatter arises from hidden factors
affecting galaxy formation and from shot noise unless it has been properly
removed. For applications involving second-order local moments, the biasing is
defined by three natural parameters: the slope b_h of the regression of g on d,
a nonlinearity b_t, and a scatter s_b. The ratio of variances b_v^2 and the
correlation coefficient r mix these parameters. The nonlinearity and the
scatter lead to underestimates of order b_t^2/b_h^2 and s_b^2/b_h^2 in the
different estimators of beta (=Omega^0.6/b_h). The nonlinear effects are
typically smaller. Local stochasticity affects the redshift-distortion analysis
only by limiting the useful range of scales, especially for power spectra. In
this range, for linear stochastic biasing, the analysis reduces to Kaiser's
formula for b_h (not b_v), independent of the scatter. The distortion analysis
is affected by nonlinear properties of biasing but in a weak way. Estimates of
the nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on simulations and
toy models, and strategies for measuring them are discussed. They may partly
explain the range of estimates for beta.

possible explanation of the observed behavior of (TaSe4)2I in its conducting
phase - namely the existence of large quasi-static fluctuations of structural
order, which however remain of finite extent above the charge density wave
transition temperature. These fluctuations produce a pseudogap in the density
of states. We compute the temperature dependence of the optical and DC
conductivities of (TaSe4)2I in its conducting phase, the nature of its core
hole spectra, and the NMR relaxation rate. Predictions for these quantities are
made on the basis of a Lee, Rice and Anderson model. This model represents the
simplest theory of a pseudogap, and gives satisfactory agreement with
experiment in the cases where comparisons can be made. In contrast, the
predictions of a strongly correlated (Luttinger Liquid) model appear to to
contradict the data. The chief remaining discrepancy is that the gap appearing
in transport quantities is less than that observed in photoemission. We discuss
some possibilities for resolving this issue.
