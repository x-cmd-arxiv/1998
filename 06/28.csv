  http://sol.stsci.edu/~marel/abstracts/abs_R23.html",,"10.1086/300730","1305 (STScI 1998)","astro-ph",,"  The surface brightness profiles of early-type galaxies have central cusps.
Two characteristic profile types are observed with HST: `core' profiles have a
break at a resolved radius and logarithmic cusp slope gamma < 0.3 inside that
radius; `power-law' profiles have no clear break and gamma > 0.3. With few
exceptions, galaxies with M_V < -22 have core profiles, and galaxies with M_V >
-20.5 have power-law profiles. Both profile types occur in galaxies with -22 <
M_V < -20.5. We show that these results are consistent with the hypothesis
that: (i) all early-type galaxies have black holes (BHs) that grew
adiabatically in homogeneous isothermal cores; and (ii) these `progenitor'
cores followed scaling relations similar to those of the fundamental plane.
  The models studied here are the ones first proposed by Young. Models with BH
masses and progenitor cores that obey established scaling relations predict (at
Virgo) that galaxies with M_V < -21.2 have core profiles and galaxies with M_V
> -21.2 have power-law profiles. This reproduces both the sense and the
absolute magnitude of the observed transition. Intrinsic scatter in BH and
galaxy properties can explain why both types of galaxies are observed around
the transition magnitude. The observed bimodality in cusp slopes may be due to
a bimodality in M_bh/L, with rapidly rotating disky galaxies having larger
M_bh/L than slowly rotating boxy galaxies.
  Application to individual galaxies with HST photometry yields a roughly
linear correlation between BH mass and V-band galaxy luminosity, log M_bh =
-1.83 + log L (solar units). This agrees with the average relation for nearby
galaxies with kinematically determined BH masses, and also with predictions
from quasar statistics (shortened abstract).

range where the magnetic susceptibility is suppressed by the spin-Peierls

separate the signals of the S=1/2- and S=1 defects of the spin-Peierls phase.
The value of g-factor of these signals is close to that of the Cu-ion. The
additional line of the magnetic resonance is characterized by an anomalous
value of the g-factor and by the threshold-like increase of the microwave
susceptibility when the microwave power is increasing. The ESR signals are
supposingly attributed to two types of the planar magnetic defects, arising at
the boundaries of the domains of the spin-Peierls state with the different
values of the phase of the dimerization.

coframe field on a space-time, was recently proposed to describe the gravity
field. This equation has a unique static, spherical-symmetric,
asymptotically-flat solution, which leads to the viable Yilmaz-Rosen metric. We
show that the wave type field equation is satisfied by the pseudo-conformal
frame if the conformal factor is determined by a scalar 3D-harmonic function.
This function can be related to the Newtonian potential of classical gravity.
So we obtain a direct relation between the non-relativistic gravity and the
relativistic model: every classical exact solution leads to a solution of the
field equation. With this result we obtain a wide class of exact, static
metrics. We show that the theory of Yilmaz relates to the pseudo-conformal
sector of our construction. We derive also a unique cosmological (time
dependent) solution of the described type.
