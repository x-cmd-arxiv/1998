counter-rotating disks and off-center collisions. Pure stellar intruders do not
produce gaseous plumes similar to those seen in the Cartwheel and VII Zw466
complexes of interacting galaxies; the presence of gas in an intruder galaxy
and radiative cooling are important for the formation of a gaseous plume
extending from the disk of a target galaxy. A noticeable plume structure can be
formed if the mass of an intruder is a few percent of the mass of the primary.
  The halo of the intruder is stripped in the collision, and dispersed
particles form a broad stellar bridge connecting the two galaxies. The fraction
of the intruder's halo dispersed in the collision depends on the total mass of
the intruder, and low-mass intruders lose most of their mass.

growth of the superbubble DEM 192? To examine this possibility, we investigate
the stellar contents and star formation history, and model the evolution of the
shell. H-R diagrams constructed from UBV photometry and spectral
classifications indicate highly coeval star formation, with the entire massive
star population having an age of ~< 2-3 Myr. However, LH 54 is constrained to
an age of ~3 Myr by the presence of a WR star, and the IMF for LH 51 suggests a
lower-mass limit implying an age of 1-2 Myr. There is no evidence of an earlier
stellar population to create the superbubble, but the modeled shell kinematics
are consistent with an origin due to the strongest stellar winds of LH 54. It
might therefore be possible that LH 54 created the superbubble, which in turn
may have triggered the creation of LH 51. Within the errors, the spatial
distribution of stellar masses and IMF appear uniform within the associations.
  We reinvestigate the estimates for stellar wind power L_w(t), during the
H-burning phase, and note that revised mass-loss rates yield a significantly
different form for L_w(t), and may affect stellar evolution timescales. We also
model superbubble expansion into an ambient medium with a sudden, discontinuous
drop in density, and find that this can easily reproduce the anomalously high
shell expansion velocities seen in many superbubbles.

an agreement strongly supports the interpretation of the observed time
stretching as time dilation caused by the cosmological expansion, rather than
physical selection effects. We fit the result to cosmological models with
$\Lambda = 0$, $\Omega_{0}$ from 0.2 to 1.0, and contrained the standard candle

enhanced effective coupling in the scattering with phonons. This weakening of
the exchange interaction can be obtained by lowering the density of the

includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses,
assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a

Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a
syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all
consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of
diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a
consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence
known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard
variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in
NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure
does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF
which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show
a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the

macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem

The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros
that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the
search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro
learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros.
This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros.
Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The
only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local
minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several
domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on

\Lambda. Standard dynamics of gauge unified theories (including fermions) and
their SSB appear if a four index field strength condensate is present. At a
vacuum state there is exact balance to zero of the gauge fields condensate and
the original scalar fields potential. As a result it is possible to combine the
solution of the \Lambda problem with inflation and transition to a \Lambda =0
phase without fine tuning after a reheating period. The model opens new
possibilities for a solution of the hierarchy problem.

relativistic and rapidly rotating neutron stars, using several realistic
equations of state (EOSs) for neutron star matter. The zero-frequency modes
signal the onset of the gravitational radiation-driven instability. We find
that the l=m=2 (bar) f-mode is unstable for stars with gravitational mass as
low as 1.0 - 1.2 M_\odot, depending on the EOS. For 1.4 M_\odot neutron stars,
the bar mode becomes unstable at 83 % - 93 % of the maximum allowed rotation
rate. For a wide range of EOSs, the bar mode becomes unstable at a ratio of
rotational to gravitational energies T/W \sim 0.07-0.09 for 1.4 M_\odot stars
and T/W \sim 0.06 for maximum mass stars. This is to be contrasted with the
Newtonian value of T/W \sim 0.14. We construct the following empirical formula
for the critical value of T/W for the bar mode,
  (T/W)_2 = 0.115 - 0.048 M / M_{max}^{sph}, which is insensitive to the EOS to
within 4 - 6 %. This formula yields an estimate for the neutral mode sequence
of the bar mode as a function only of the star's mass, M, given the maximum
allowed mass, M_{max}^{sph}, of a nonrotating neutron star. The recent
discovery of the fast millisecond pulsar in the supernova remnant N157B,
supports the suggestion that a fraction of proto-neutron stars are born in a
supernova collapse with very large initial angular momentum. Thus, in a
fraction of newly born neutron stars the instability is a promising source of
continuous gravitational waves. It could also play a major role in the
rotational evolution (through the emission of angular momentum) of merged
binary neutron stars, if their post-merger angular momentum exceeds the maximum
allowed to form a Kerr black hole.

spectra of various hadrons and clusters (e.g. pi, K, N, Phi, Lambda, d, He) in

We discuss the sensitivity of these spectra with respect to the initial
transverse density profile as well as to the choice of ``freeze-out''
hypersurface. For SPS energy and pT<2 GeV, overall good agreement of the pT
distributions with data is found when freeze-out occurs along the T=130 MeV
isotherm. Even high-pT neutral pion data can be described for a particular
choice of the initial transverse density profile. It is shown that the average
transverse velocity <vT> of heavy hadrons and hadronic clusters is a good
measure for the collective flow velocity. The latter is found to be rather
similar for SPS and RHIC energies, due to the ``stall'' of the flow within the
long-lived mixed phase at RHIC. In case of thermalization and hydrodynamical
expansion, the mean transverse momentum <pT> increases linearly with the hadron
mass. In contrast, the string model FRITIOF7.02, which does not account for
rescattering of secondary hadrons, predicts a strong dependence of <pT> on the
quark composition of the hadron. Due to the different sensitivity to hard
processes, hadrons with charm (anti-)quarks acquire significantly more
transverse momentum than hadrons without c (or even without s) quarks.

integer function can not be sped up for functions chosen randomly. Any other
algorithm acting in substantially shorter time $o(\sqrt{2^n})$ gives incorrect
answer for the functions with the single point of maximum chosen randomly with
probability converging to 1. The lower bound as $\Omega (\sqrt{2^n /b})$ was
established for the quantum search for solution of equations $f(x)=1$ where $f$
is a Boolean function with $b$ such solutions chosen at random with probability
converging to 1.

  ""Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics""","Stud.Hist.Philos.Mod.Phys. 30 (1999) 237-259",,"UMCP-CHPS-1001","quant-ph",,"  Recent authors have raised objections to the counterfactual interpretation of
the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule of time symmetrized quantum theory
(TSQT). I distinguish between two different readings of the ABL rule,
counterfactual and non-counterfactual, and confirm that TSQT advocate L.
Vaidman is employing the counterfactual reading to which these authors object.
Vaidman has responded to the objections by proposing a new kind of
time-symmetrized counterfactual, which he has defined in two different ways. It
is argued that neither definition succeeds in overcoming the objections, except
in a special case previously noted by Cohen and Hiley. In addition, a
connection is made between TSQT and Price's concept of `advanced action', which
further supports the special case discussed.
