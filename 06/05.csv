from deep K-band image by the KPNO-IRIM camera, by applying a rigorous
morphological classification scheme based on quantitative analyses of the
surface brightness profiles. The broad-band spectra of the sample galaxies
allow us to date their dominant stellar populations. The majority of bright
early-types in this field are found at redshifts z<1.3 to display colors
indicative of a fairly wide range of ages (typically 1.5 to 3 Gyrs). We find
that the major episodes of star-formation building up typical M_star galaxies
have taken place during a wide redshift interval 1<z<4 for q_0=0.5, which
becomes 1<z<3 for q_0=0.15. Our estimated galactic masses, for a Salpeter IMF,
are found in the range from a few billion to a few 10^{11} solar masses already
at z=1. So the bright end of the E/S0 population is mostly in place by that
cosmic epoch, with space densities, masses and luminosities consistent with
those of the local field E/S0 population. What distinguishes the present sample
is a remarkable absence of objects at z>1.3, which should be detectable during
the luminous star-formation phase expected to happen at these redshifts.
Obvious solutions are a) that the merging events imply perturbed morphologies
which prevent selecting them by our morphological classification filter, or b)
that a dust-polluted ISM obscures the (either continuous or episodic) events of
star-formation. We conclude that the likely solution is a combination thereof,
i.e. a set of dust-enshrouded merging-driven starbursts occurring during the
first few Gyrs of the galaxy's lifetime.

of the Halpha /[NII] line blend has enabled us to distinguish emission from the

preferentially magnifying the side of the inner narrow-line region between the
AGN and the observer, and the other side is both less magnified and partially
obscured by the torus. The hydrogen densities of clouds in this region are high
enough to make the Balmer lines optically thick and to suppress forbidden
emission lines with low critical densities. We have deduced the column density
of both ionised and neutral gas in the narrow-line clouds, and the density of
the ionised gas. Using these we have been able to estimate the mass of the
inner narrow-line clouds to be ~ 1 solar mass, and show that the gas:dust ratio
NH/E(B-V) in these clouds must be ~1.3x10^{27}m^{-2}mag^{-1}, significantly
higher than in the Milky Way. The cloud properties are consistent with the
those of the warm absorbers seen in the X-ray spectra of Seyfert-1 galaxies.

and B abundances as a function of iron observed in metal poor halo stars. In
both cases, this linearity indicates that freshly synthesized C and O are
accelerated by Type II supernovae and subsequently fragmented into Be and B.
One mechanism advocates shock acceleration in the gaseous phase of superbubbles
excavated by collective SNII explosions. Because of their short lifetimes, only
the most massive stars (with an initial mass greater than 60\msun) do not drift
out of superbubbles, and participate in BeB production. The second mechanism is
based on the acceleration of the debris of grains formed in the ejecta of all
SNIIs (originating from stars with initial mass greater than 8\msun). Here
again, fresh C and O are sped up to cosmic ray energies by shocks. We propose a
possible test to discriminate between the two scenarios. If supernovae of all
masses are involved in BeB production, the Be/Fe ratio is constant, since both
elements are produced in the same events. Alternatively, when only the most
massive stars are involved in Be production, Be/Fe is enhanced at very early
times because of the shorter lifetimes of these stars. This predicted
difference in the behavior of Be/Fe could be tested by high quality
observations at [Fe/H] $\lsim -3$. We also note that the solution invoking only
the most massive supernovae mimics a flat evolution of both Be/H and B/H as a
function of Fe/H at low metallicity, and could thus resemble a ""plateau"" for
these elements despite a lack of a primordial Big Bang nucleosynthesis origin.
Consequently, there may be no need to invoke inhomogeneous Big Bang models to
explain the initial production of BeB should a plateau be discovered.

expressed by a self-similar solution. The central density increases greatly in
a finite time scale and reaches a density at which an opaque core is formed at
the center. After that, matter accretes to the newly formed core (accretion
phase). In this stage, a rotationally supported disk is formed in a cloud core
without magnetic fields. In contrast, the disk continues to contract in the
magnetized cloud core, since the magnetic fields transfer angular momentum from
the disk. Its rotation motion winds up the threading magnetic field lines.
Eventually, strong toroidal magnetic fields are formed and begin to drive the

molecular outflows observed in protostar candidates are naturally explained by
this model.

accreting compact stars. Our estimates are based on approximations that
facilitate back-of-the-envelope calculations. We discuss two different cases:
  1) For recycled millisecond pulsars we argue that the r-mode instability may
be active at rotation periods longer than the Kepler period (which provides the
dynamical limit on rotation) as long as the core temperature is larger than
about $2\times10^5$ K. Our estimates suggest that the instability may have
played a role in the evolution of the fastest spinning pulsars, and that it may
be presently active in the recently discovered 2.49 ms X-ray pulsar SAX
J1808.4-3658 as well as the rapidly spinning neutron stars observed in low mass
X-ray binaries. This provides a new explanation for the remarkably similar
rotation periods inferred from kHz quasi-periodic oscillations in the LMXBs.
The possibility that the rotation of recycled pulsars may be
gravitational-radiation limited is interesting because the gravitational waves
from a neutron star rotating at the instability limit may well be detectable
with the new generation of interferometric detectors. 2) We also consider white
dwarfs, and find that the r-mode instability may possibly be active in short
period white dwarfs. Our order of magnitude estimates (for a white dwarf of
$M=M_\odot$ and $R=0.01 R_\odot$ composed of $C^{12}$) show that the
instability could be operating for rotational periods shorter than $P\approx
27-33$ s. This number is in interesting agreement with the observed periods
($>28$ s) of the rapidly spinning DQ Herculis stars. However, we find that the
instability grows too slowly to affect the rotation of these stars
significantly .

  We show that many observations of W44, a supernova remnant in the galactic
plane at a distance of about 2500 pc, are remarkably consistent with the
simplest realistic model. The model remnant is evolving in a smooth ambient
medium of fairly high density, about 6 cm^-3 on average, with a substantial
density gradient. At the observed time it has an age of about 20,000 years,
consistent with the age of the associated pulsar, and a radius of 11 to 13 pc.
Over most of the outer surface, radiative cooling has become important in the
post shock gas; on the denser end there has been sufficient compression of the
cooled gas to develop a very thin dense half shell of about 450 M_sun,
supported against further compression by nonthermal pressure. The half shell
has an expansion velocity of about 150 km s^-1, and is bounded on the outer
surface by a radiative shock with that speed.
  We provide several analytic tools for the assembly of models of this type. We
review the early evolution and shell formation analyses and their
generalizations to evolution in a density gradient. We also calculate the
density and temperature that should be present in the hot interior of a remnant
with thermal conduction. We supply the van der Laan mechanism in a particularly
useful form for the calculation of radio continuum from radiative remnants.
Finally, we demonstrate a simple technique for estimating the optical emission
expected. These tools are employed to choose parameters of models which we then
explore with our 1d and 2d hydrocodes, providing, respectively, the detailed
x-ray spectra and dynamical characteristics.

torus doubling to chaos via SNA, torus breaking to chaos via SNA and period
doubling bifurcations of fractal torus are demonstrated with the aid of the two
parameter ($f-\epsilon$) phase diagram. More interestingly, in order to
approach the strange nonchaotic attractor, the existence of several new
bifurcations on the torus corresponding to the novel phenomenon of torus
bubbling are described. Particularly, we point out the new routes to chaos,
namely, (1) two frequency quasiperiodicity $\to$ torus doubling $\to$ torus

approximation of the relativistic kinetic energy terms in the spinless Salpeter
equation by expressions of the nonrelativistic form M+\epsilon+p^2/2M for each

we generate energy spectra for q\bar{q} mesons composed of two light or two

taking M fixed at the value M_q=\sqrt{<p^2> +m_q^2}, or allowing M_q to vary in
the fit. The energies of the lowest few c\bar{s} states are then predicted with
similar accuracy. The reasons for the success of the nonrelativistic

flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC's) are allowed, but must be reasonably
suppressed at low energies of probes. It has been known that the existing
hierarchies of quark masses render this suppression at low energies rather
natural. On the other hand, the model has been regarded by many as unnatural
because of the absence of any symmetry that would ensure persistence of this
suppression as the energy of probes increases. The opinion has been based on
the expectation that the mentioned FCNC's would increase by large factors at
increasing energies. We performed a numerical analysis of the flow of these FCN
coupling parameters as governed by the one-loop renormalization group equations
(RGE's), in a simplified case when Yukawa couplings of the first quark
generation are neglected. The analysis shows a remarkable persistence of the
mentioned FCNC suppression and thus indicates that the model is not unnatural

constructed up to any precision with respect to h, h-->0.

Quantum Mechanics which involve real superpotentials to complex
superpotentials. This allows to deal with a large class of non-hermitean
Hamiltonians and to study in general the isospectrality between complex
potentials. In very specific cases we can construct in a natural way
""quasi-complex"" potentials which we define as complex potentials having a
global property such as to lead to a Hamiltonian with real spectrum. We also
obtained a class of complex transparent potentials whose Hamiltonian can be
intertwined to a free Hamiltonian. We provide a variety of examples both for
the radial problem (half axis) and for the standard one-dimensional problem
(the whole axis), including remarks concerning scattering problems.

the radial hydrogen-like Hamiltonian. An algebraic intertwining technique
involving such factorization energies leads to derive $n$-parametric families

Hamiltonians. The construction of SUSY partner Hamiltonians with ground state
energies greater than the corresponding ground state energy of the initial
Hamiltonian is also explicitly performed.
