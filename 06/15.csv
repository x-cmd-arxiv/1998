spectral-energy-distributions (MIR SEDs) of galaxies into models for the number
counts and redshift distributions of MIR surveys. A three-component model, with
empirically determined MIR SED templates of (1) a cirrus/PDR component (2) a
starburst component and (3) an AGN component, is developed for infrared
(3--120\micron) SEDs of galaxies. The model includes a complete IRAS 25\micron
selected sample of 1406 local galaxies ($z \leq 0.1$; Shupe et al. 1998a).
Results based on these 1406 spectra show that the MIR emission features cause
significant effects on the redshift dependence of the K-corrections for fluxes
in the WIRE 25\micron band and ISOCAM 15\micron band. This in turn will affect
deep counts and redshift distributions in these two bands, as shown by the
predictions of two evolution models (a luminosity evolution model with
$L\propto (1+z)^3$ and a density evolution model with $\rho\propto (1+z)^4$).
The dips-and-bumps on curves of MIR number counts, caused by the emission
features, should be useful indicators of evolution mode. The strong emission
features at $\sim 6$--8\micron will help the detections of relatively high
redshift ($z\sim 2$) galaxies in MIR surveys. On the other hand, determinations
of the evolutionary rate based on the slope of source counts, and studies on
the large scale structures using the redshift distribution of MIR sources, will
have to treat the effects of the MIR emission features carefully. We have also
estimated a 15\micron local luminosity function from the predicted 15\micron
fluxes of the 1406 galaxies using the bivariate (15\micron vs. 25\micron
luminosities) method. This luminosity function will improve our understanding
of the ISOCAM 15\micron surveys.

Galactic center is now very compelling. There is no question that the stellar
and gas kinematics within 0.01 pc is dominated by under-luminous matter in the
form of either a massive black hole, a highly condensed distribution of stellar
remnants, or a more exotic source of gravity. The unique, compact radio source
Sgr A* appears to be coincident with the center of this region, but its size
(less than 3x10^14 cm at lambda=1.35cm) is still significantly smaller than the
current limiting volume enclosing this mass. Sgr A* may be the black hole, if
the dark matter distribution is point-like. If not, we are left with a puzzle
regarding its nature, and a question of why this source should be so unique and
lie only at the Galactic center. Here, we examine an alternative to the black
hole paradigm---that the gravitating matter is a condensed cluster of stellar
remnants---and study the properties of the Galactic center wind flowing through
this region. Some of this gas is trapped in the cluster potential, and we study
in detail whether this hot, magnetized gas is in the proper physical state to
produce Sgr A*'s spectrum. We find that at least for the Galactic center
environment, the temperature of the trapped gas never attains the value
required for significant GHz emission. In addition, continuum (mostly
bremsstrahlung) emission at higher frequencies is below the current
measurements and upper limits for this source. We conclude that the cluster
potential is too shallow for the trapped Galactic center wind to account for
Sgr A*'s spectrum, which instead appears to be produced only within an
environment that has a steep-gradient potential like that generated by a black
hole.

the rate of spurious background present in any experiment. The problem is
solved by placing an upper bound to the unmodulated part of the signal using
the best exclusion plot. We find that the lowest backgrounds achieved result in

  The overall X/gamma spectrum is found to be strongly angle-dependent. When
the accretion disc is seen with a nearly edge-on orientation the reflection
hump is weak, while a face-on viewing angle leads to a proeminent reflection
hump with an equivalent reflection coefficient R close to 50. Such reflection
dominated Seyfert 1s galaxies are not observed. By fitting observed X/gamma

  Although the model succeed in reproducing individual observed spectra, it
requires all the Seyfert 1s observed in the X-ray band to be seen with large

we show that the ionisation of a fair part of the reflecting disk could
represent an interesting improvement of the model, consistent with the data and

even assuming a nuclear obscuration up to 10^{28} m^{-2} (10^{24} cm^{-2}).
This is at least an order of magnitude lower than the estimated past activity,

kinematical structure of the metal absorptions makes this system ideal to
discuss the [O/Si] and [N/O] ratios. We find [O/H] ~ -2.7 and -2.7 < [Si/H] <
-2.2. By combining these data with information gathered in the literature, we
study the kinematics of the low and high ionization phases in a sample of 26
damped Ly-alpha systems in the redshift range 1.17-4.38. We note a strong
correlation between the velocity broadenings of the SiII,1808 and FeII,1608
lines whatever the line optical depth, implying that the physical conditions
are quite homogeneous in the sample. Statistically this shows that large
variations of abundance ratios and thus large variations of depletion into dust
grains are unlikely. The velocity broadening of the absorption lines, Delta V,
is correlated with the asymmetry of the lines for Delta V < 150 km/s. The
broader the line the more asymmetric it is, as expected in case rotation
dominates the line broadening. However this correlation does not hold for
larger Delta V suggesting that evidence for rotational motions is restricted to
velocity broadenings Delta V < 150 km/s. The systems with Delta V > 200 km/s
are peculiar with kinematics consistent with random motions. They show
sub-systems as those expected if the objects are in the process of merging

a weak localization correction reminiscent of quasi-one-dimensional metallic

increasing energy over a scale set by the Thouless energy. This crossover

asymmetries in hadron-hadron scattering; in so doing we bring to light a novel
factorisation property. As already known, the requirement of an imaginary part
leads to consideration of twist-three contributions that are also related to
transverse spin in deep-inelastic scattering. In particular, when an external
line becomes soft in contributions arising from three-parton correlators, the
imaginary part of an internal propagator may be exposed. As shown here, it is
precisely this kinematical configuration that permits the factorisation. An
important feature is the resulting simplification: the calculation of tens of
Feynman diagrams normally contributing to such processes is reduced to the
evaluation of products of the simple factors derived here and known two-body
helicity amplitudes. We thus find clarifying relations between the
spin-dependent and spin-averaged cross-sections and formulate a series of
selection rules. In addition, the kinematical dependence of such asymmetries,
is rendered more transparent.

by a mass scale $E_c \sim F^2/\Sigma_0 L^2$ (with $F$ the pion decay constant,
$\Sigma_0$ the chiral condensate and $L$ the size of the box). In the ergodic

of Damgaard's relation between the spectral density and the finite volume

square well or barrier in the Dirac equation. It is shown that spontaneous
positron emission occurs for a well if the potential is strong enough. The
vacuum charge and lifetime of the well are estimated. If the well is wide
enough, a seemingly constant current is emitted. These phenomena are transient
whereas the tunnelling first calculated by Klein is time-independent. Klein
tunnelling is a property of relativistic wave equations, not necessarily
connected to particle emission. The Coulomb potential is investigated in this
context: it is shown that a heavy nucleus of sufficiently large $Z$ will bind
positrons. Correspondingly, it is expected that as $Z$ increases the Coulomb
barrier will become increasingly transparent to positrons. This is an example
of Klein tunnelling.
