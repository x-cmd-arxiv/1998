angular distribution of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We show that the
spectrum of extragalactic cosmic rays with energies below $\sim 10^{20}$ eV may
be due to the diffusive propagation in the Local Supercluster with fields of
$\sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ Gauss. Above $\sim 10^{20}$ eV, cosmic rays propagate
in an almost rectilinear way which is evidenced by the change in shape of the
spectrum at the highest energies. The fit to the spectrum requires that at
least one source be located relatively nearby at $\sim 10-15$ Mpc away from the
Milky Way. We discuss the origin of magnetic fields in the Local Supercluster
and the observable predictions of this model.

If the galaxy is a cluster member then its redshift is $z=0.46$. The images of
the source appear unresolved in the WFC implying that the source is a quasar.
We have modeled the lens as both a single galaxy and a galaxy plus a cluster.
The latter model yields excellent fits to the image positions along with
reasonable parameters for the galaxy and cluster making HST 1411+5211 a likely

source discovered by King et al. (1995) at 1700 A. This source is resolved,
with r_{1/2} approx0.2 pc. It dominates the nucleus at 3000 A, and is
consistent with late B-early A stars. This probable cluster may consist of
young stars and be an older version of the cluster of hot stars at the center
of the Milky Way, or it may consist of heavier stars built up from collisions
in a possible cold disk of stars orbiting P2. In M32, the central cusp rises
into the HST limit with gamma approx0.5, and the central density
rho_0>10^7M_sol pc^-3. The V-I and U-V color profiles are flat, and there is no
sign of an inner disk, dust, or any other structure. This total lack of

should come from blue stragglers. InM33, the nucleus has an extremely steep
gamma=1.49 power-law profile for 0.05""<r<0.2"" that becomes shallower as the HST

rho_0 > 2 10^6M_sol pc^-3, and the implied relaxation time is only ~3 X 10^6

solution of large, multidimensional structural or slowly-evolving problems
(rotating stars, interacting binaries, thick advective accretion disks, four
dimensional spacetimes, etc.). The technique employed is the Finite Element
Method (FEM), commonly used to solve engineering structural problems. The
approach developed herein has the following key features:
  1. The computational mesh can extend into the time dimension, as well as
space, perhaps only a few cells, or throughout spacetime.
  2. Virtually all equations describing the astrophysics of continuous media,
including the field equations, can be written in a compact form similar to that
routinely solved by most engineering finite element codes.
  3. The transformations that occur naturally in the four-dimensional FEM
possess both coordinate and boost features, such that
  (a) although the computational mesh may have a complex, non-analytic,
curvilinear structure, the physical equations still can be written in a simple
coordinate system independent of the mesh geometry.
  (b) if the mesh has a complex flow velocity with respect to coordinate space,
the transformations will form the proper arbitrary Lagrangian- Eulerian
advective derivatives automatically.
  4. The complex difference equations on the arbitrary curvilinear grid are
generated automatically from encoded differential equations.
  This first paper concentrates on developing a robust and widely-applicable
set of techniques using the nonlinear FEM and presents some examples.

temperature and abundance are spatially rather constant, although the cool
emission component is reconfirmed in the central region. The azimuthally-
averaged radial X-ray surface brightness profiles are very similar between soft
(0.7--3 keV) and hard (3--10 keV) energy bands, and neither can be fitted with
a single-$\beta$ model due to a strong data excess within $\sim5'$ of the
cluster center. In contrast, double-$\beta$ models can successfully reproduce
the overall brightness profiles both in the soft and hard energy bands, as well
as that derived with the \ROSAT PSPC. Properties of the central excess
brightness are very similar over the 0.2--10 keV energy range spanned by \ROSAT
and \ASCA. Thus, the excess X-ray emission from the core region of this cluster
is confirmed for the first time in hard X-rays above 3 keV. This indicates that
the shape of the gravitational potential becomes deeper than the King-type one
towards the cluster center. Radial profiles of the total gravitating matter,
calculated using the double-$\beta$ model, reveal an excess mass of $\sim 3

to the cD galaxy and the entire cluster.

from the cyclic properties ($S^1$ homotopy) of the topological manifold
$Q=2T^3\oplus 3S^1\times S^2$ which has 23 intrinsic degrees of freedom,
discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\times Z_3$ internal groups, an SU(5) or SO(10) gauge
group, and leads to an anomalous U(1) symmetry on a lattice. These properties
can in principle reproduce the standard model with a stable proton. The general
equation of motion for the unified theory is derived up to the Planck energy
and leads to a Higgs field with possible inflation. The thermodynamic
properties of $Q$ are discussed and yield a consistent amplitude for the cosmic
microwave background fluctuations. The manifold $Q$ possesses internal energy
scales which are independent of the field theory defined on it, but which
constrain the predicted mass hierarchy of such theories. In particular the
electron and its neutrino are identified as particle ground states and their

volumes of ideal tetrahedra, corresponding to 1-loop massless triangle

complementary to a hyperbolic knot. In the case that the knot is positive, and
hence implicated in field theory, ease of ideal reduction correlates with
likely appearance in counterterms. Volumes of knots relevant to the number

the RMC pair spectrometer at the TRIUMF cyclotron. Currently, only an
experimental upper limit of B.R.<= 5.5E-4 is available for the two-gamma
capture mode. Our new data will critically test the theoretical calculations
and the intriguing predicted dominance of the pi pi --> gamma gamma
annihilation graph. More speculatively, since crossing symmetry relates pi pi
--> gamma gamma to gamma pi --> gamma pi, this threshold reaction may be a
novel probe of the pion's electric polarizability.
  We show results of our 1997 engineering run and Monte Carlo studies for the
two photon capture mode of pionic hydrogen and carbon. We also present our
preliminary upper limit for the pi- p --> gamma gamma n B.R. <= 2.8E-4.

acid (CDIMA) reaction-diffusion system is investigated numerically using a
realistic model of this system. We analyze the one-dimensional patterns formed
along the gradients imposed by boundary feeds, and study their linear stability
to symmetry-breaking perturbations (Turing instability) in the plane transverse
to these gradients. We establish that an often-invoked simple local linear
analysis which neglects longitudinal diffusion is inappropriate for predicting
the linear stability of these patterns. Using a fully nonuniform analysis, we
investigate the structure of the patterns formed along the gradients and their
stability to transverse Turing pattern formation as a function of the values of
two control parameters: the malonic acid feed concentration and the size of the
reactor in the dimension along the gradients. The results from this
investigation are compared with existing experiments.

breaking patterns in a single layer is numerically determined. We find this
transition to be discontinuous. We make connection with earlier results and
discuss prospects for future work.

mechanics are analyzed and it is shown that both theories employ a formal
approach to microphysics. By using a realistic approach it can be established
that the internal structures of extended particles comply with a wave-equation.
Including external potentials yields the Schrodinger equation, which, in this
context, is arbitrary due to internal energy components. The statistical
interpretation of wave functions in quantum theory as well as Heisenberg's
uncertainty relations are shown to be an expression of this, fundamental,
arbitrariness. Electrons and photons can be described by an identical
formalism, providing formulations equivalent to the Maxwell equations.
Electrostatic interactions justify the initial assumption of electron-wave
stability: the stability of electron waves can be referred to vanishing
intrinsic fields of interaction. The theory finally points out some fundamental
difficulties for a fully covariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics,
which seem to be related to the existing infinity problems in this field.
