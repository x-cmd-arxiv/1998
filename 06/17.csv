  The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/306431",,"astro-ph",,"  We present the first results from a program of near-infrared spectroscopy
aimed at studying the familiar rest-frame optical emission lines from the H II
regions of Lyman break galaxies at z = 3. By targeting redshifts which bring
the lines of interest into gaps between the strong OH sky emission, we have
been successful in detecting Balmer and [O III] emission lines in all five
galaxies observed so far with CGS4 on UKIRT. For a Salpeter IMF and a H_0 = 70
km/s/Mpc, q_0 = 0.1 cosmology, the Hbeta luminosities uncorrected for dust
extinction imply star formation rates of 20 - 270 solar masses per year. On the
basis of the present limited sample it appears that an extinction of 1 - 2
magnitudes at 1500 A may be typical of Lyman break galaxies. This value is
consistent with recent estimates of dust obscuration in star forming galaxies
at z < 1, and does not require a substantial revision of the broad picture of
star formation over the Hubble time proposed by Madau et al. (1996). In four
out of five cases the velocity dispersion of the emission line gas is sigma =
70 km/s, while in the fifth the line widths are nearly three times larger.
Virial masses in the range from 1 x 10^{10} to 5 x 10^{10} solar masses are
suggested, but both velocities and masses could be higher because our
observations are only sensitive to the brightest cores of these systems where
the line widths may not sample the full gravitational potential. The relative
redshifts of interstellar absorption, nebular emission, and Lyman alpha
emission lines differ by several hundred km/s and suggest that large-scale
outflows may be a common characteristic of Lyman break galaxies.

of orbiting Kuiper belt-like objects. Here we present the
Orbiting-Evaporating-Bodies scenario in which the disk is a gigantic
multi-cometary tail supplied by slowly evaporating bodies like Chiron. If dust
is produced by evaporation, a planet with an eccentric orbit can explain the
observed asymmetry of the disk, because the periastron distribution of the
parent bodies are then expected to be non-axisymmetric. We investigate the
consequence for the Kuiper belt-like objects of the formation and the migration
of an outer planet like Neptune in Fernandez's scheme (1982). We find that
bodies trapped in resonance with a migrating planet can significantly
evaporate, producing a Beta Pic-like disk with similar characteristics like
opening angle and asymmetry.
  We thus show that the Beta Pic disk can be a transient phenomenon. The
circumstellar disks around main sequence stars can be the signature of the
present formation and migration of outer planets.

(LMXB) dipping source XB 1916-053. The source joins the small group of LMXB
detected at energies ~100 keV. The non-dip spectrum is well fitted by an
absorbed blackbody with a temperature of 1.62+/-0.05 keV and an absorbed
cut-off power law with a photon index of 1.61+/- 0.01 and a cut-off energy of
80+/-10 keV. Below 10 keV, where photoelectric absorption is dominant, the
dramatic spectral changes observed during dips can be simply modelled by
progressive covering of the blackbody and cut-off power law components. The
blackbody component is very rapidly absorbed during dips, consistent with it
being point-like, while the cutoff power law is more gradually absorbed,
consistent with it being extended. The most likely locations for the blackbody
component are the surface of the neutron star or the boundary layer between the
neutron star and the accretion disk. The extended emission most probably
originates in an accretion disk corona. Above 10 keV, dipping is detected up to
\~40 keV, and there is some evidence for an energy-independent reduction in
intensity of up to 15%. This reduction could be caused by electron scattering
or obscuration. In the first case, the change is consistent with an electron
column density of ~2.9e23cm^-2, several times smaller than the average hydrogen

resolution echelle spectroscopic observations taken in 12-21th January 1998
exhibit a dramatic increase in the chromospheric emissions (H_alpha and CaII
IRT lines) that we interpret as a flare based on: the temporal evolution of the
event, the broad component observed in the H_alpha line profile, the detection
of the HeI D_3 in emission and a filled-in HeI 6678 A. During these obsevations
we detect a LiI 6708 A line enhancement which is clearly related with the
temporal evolution of the flare. The maximum LiI enhancement occurs just after
the maximum chromospheric emission observed in the flare. A significant
increase of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is also detected. From all this we
suggest that this LiI enhancement is produced by spallation reactions during
the flare. This is the first time that such LiI enhancement associate with a
stellar flare is reported, and probably the long-duration of this flare is a
key factor for this detection. A large fraction of the stellar surface seems to
be covered by starspots during the event, as we deduce for the analysis of the
TiO 7055 A band. Thus taking into account that LiI line is very temperature
sensitive, we can not discard that the LiI variations are related the presence
of starspots. However, the correlation with the temporal evolution of the
flare, lack of detection of changes in the other photospheric absorption lines,
and the large changes observed in the core of the LiI, as predict the models,
argue in favour of the hypothesis that the LiI is produced during the flare.

mark a difference with respect to the SVP data, where a steeper power law below
0.5 keV, an absorption feature at 0.6 keV, and a more prominent fluorescence
iron line have been found. The weakening of cold/warm matter signatures in our

the featureless continuum produced in a relativistic jet overwhelms any thermal
and/or reprocessed radiation, while the two components were almost comparable

the absence of reliable information on the temperature structure of the
intracluster gas, most analyses have been carried out under the assumption of
isothermality. We combine X-ray data from the ROSAT PSPC and the ASCA GIS

there is strong evidence to suggest that the cluster departs from a simple

central galaxy velocity dispersion is too high to allow a physical solution for
the galaxy orbits. The quality of the radio and X-ray data do not at present

microlensing experiments using medium and high resolution spectroscopy
(resolution > 6000). Since the radial velocity of the lens and lensed source
typically differs by ~100km/s, the spectral lines from the lens and source will
be shifted relative to each other by (1-2)A in the optical. We simulate
realistic composite spectra assuming different spectral types for the lens and
source and study the lens detectability as a function of the signal-to-noise
ratio, spectral resolution and lens-to-source light ratio. We show that it is
possible to measure the difference in radial velocity from an unequivocal
signature in the difference of cross- and auto-correlation functions calculated
from two spectra obtained at different magnifications. If the lens is brighter
than 10% of the unmagnified source we find that a spectral resolution of ~6000
and a signal-to-noise of 50 (at magnification maximum) are sufficient to
determine the relative radial velocity of the lens. At resolution ~40000, the
spectral resolution of high resolution spectrographs of 8-10m class telescopes,
the lens could even be detected at a brightness of ~3% of the source. Radial
velocities higher than 50km/s can be measured with an accuracy of a few km/s.

parameters are well known and which were observed with the same instrument. In
order to obtain a meaningful comparison between target and reference spectra,
all features which are not intrinsic to the objects must be removed. This
treatment involves the correction of the blaze efficiency for each order,
cosmic rays hits and telluric line removal, convolution of the spectra to a
common spectral resolution, wavelength scale and flux level adjustment. The
library available at the present time covers the effective temperature range
[4000K, 6300K], the metallicity range [-2.9, +0.35] and the gravities of both

that, for quite a wide range of amount of anisotropy in the system, the
critical value of the concentration of the system (defined as the ratio of the
tidal to the King core radius of the system) is approximately constant and
equal to the corresponding value for isotropic systems. Only for very
anisotropic systems the critical value of the concentration starts to change
and it decreases significantly as the anisotropy increases and penetrates the
inner parts of the system. For Wilson models the decrease of the concentration
of critical models is preceded by an intermediate regime in which critical
concentration increases, it reaches a maximum and then it starts to decrease.
The critical value of the central potential always decreases as the anisotropy
increases.

oxygen overabundance with respect to [Fe/H] is similar to that seen in previous
works based on OI IR triplet data (Abia and Rebolo 1989; Tomkin et al. 1992;
Cavallo, Pilachowski, and Rebolo 1997). Contrary to the previously accepted
picture, our oxygen abundances, derived from low-excitation OH lines, agree
well with those derived from high-excitation lines of the triplet. For nine
stars in common with Tomkin et al. we obtain a mean difference of 0.00+/-0.11
dex with respect to the abundances determined from the triplet using the same
stellar parameters and model photospheres. For four stars in our sample we have
found measurements of the [OI] 6300 A line in the literature, from which we
derive oxygen abundances consistent (average difference 0.09 dex) with those
based on OH lines, showing that the long standing controversy between oxygen
abundances from forbidden and permitted lines in metal-poor unevolved stars can
be resolved. Our new oxygen abundances show a smooth extension of the
Edvardsson et al.'s (1993) [O/Fe] versus metallicity curve to much lower
abundances, with a slope -0.31+/- 0.11 (taking into account the error bars in
both oxygen abundances and metallicities) in the range -3<[Fe/H]<-1.

combined with the feedback effect on the spin damping due to superconductivity
yields a Fermi-liquid form of the fermionic spectral function for $\omega < 2
\Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum value of the superconducting gap, and a
non-Fermi-liquid form for $\omega > 2 {\Delta}$. In the Fermi-liquid regime,
the spectral function $A({\bf k}_F,\omega)$ displays a quasiparticle peak at
$\omega = {\Delta}$; in the non-Fermi-liquid regime it possesses a broad
maximum (hump) at $\omega \gg {\Delta}$. In between the two regimes, the

seen in final-state observables, such as the charged particle multiplicity, the
magnitude of produced transverse energy, or the number of produced strange
hadrons.

theory. We use a local pseudopotential that has been adjusted to experimental
bulk properties and the atomic 3s level of sodium. Our studies have shown that
both the ionic structure of the ground state and the positions of the plasmon
resonances depend sensitively on the pseudopotential used in the calculation,
which stresses the importance of its consistent use in both steps.

molecules in water are reviewed. The hydration of imidazole and imidazolium
solutes is used to exemplify the theoretical issues. The treatment of
long-ranged electrostatic interactions in simulations is discussed extensively.
It is argued that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration
free energies in the thermodynamic limit from molecular calculations; and that
molecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions
can also be more efficient than many common alternatives. The Ewald treatment
permits a conclusive extrapolation to infinite system size. The picture that
emerges from testing of simple models is that the most prominent failings of
the simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that
lead to non-gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most
favorable cases for the second-order perturbation theories are monoatomic
positive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, continuum or gaussian theories
are less accurate. The appreciation of the specific deficiencies of those
simple models have led to new concepts, multistate gaussian and quasi-chemical
theories, that address the cases for which the simpler theories fail. It is
argued that, relative to direct dielectric continuum treatments, the
quasi-chemical theories provide a better theoretical organization for the
computational study of the electronic structure of solution species.

fermions and renormalized diabatic phonons. Simple calculations on $H_{2}$,
$HD$, and $D_{2}$ systems are performed and compared with previous approaches.

  neuro-sys archive which was never publicly announced (was 9806001)",,,"LA-UR-97-4813","q-bio.NC q-bio.QM",,"  We present a new approach to the electromagnetic inverse problem that
explicitly addresses the ambiguity associated with its ill-posed character.
Rather than calculating a single ``best'' solution according to some criterion,
our approach produces a large number of likely solutions that both fit the data
and any prior information that is used. While the range of the different likely
results is representative of the ambiguity in the inverse problem even with
prior information present, features that are common across a large number of
the different solutions can be identified and are associated with a high degree
of probability. This approach is implemented and quantified within the
formalism of Bayesian inference which combines prior information with that from
measurement in a common framework using a single measure. To demonstrate this
approach, a general neural activation model is constructed that includes a
variable number of extended regions of activation and can incorporate a great
deal of prior information on neural current such as information on location,
orientation, strength and spatial smoothness. Taken together, this activation
model and the Bayesian inferential approach yield estimates of the probability
distributions for the number, location, and extent of active regions. Both
simulated MEG data and data from a visual evoked response experiment are used
to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach.

nondispersive, i.e. energy-independent, phase shifts in interferometers is
generalized in a new proof which shows that the precise condition for
nondispersivity is a force-free interaction. The converse theorem is disproved
by a conceptual counter example. Applications to several nondispersive
interference phenomena are reviewed briefly. Those fall into two classes which
are objectively distinct from each other in that in the first class phase
shifts depend only on the topology of the interfering beam paths while in the
second class force-free physical interactions take place at identifiable points
along the path. Apparent disagreements in the literature about the topological
nature of the phenomena in the second class stem from differing definitions.
