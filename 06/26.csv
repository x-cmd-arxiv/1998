NGC1068. We have measured the Br_gamma fluxes in a number of star forming

We investigate the star forming histories of these regions and find that a
short burst of star formation occured co-evally throughout the ring within the
last 30-40 Myr, and perhaps as recently as 4-7 Myr ago. The 1-0 S(1) flux and
S(1)/Br_gamma ratios indicate that as well as fluorescence, shock excited H_2
emission contributes to the total flux. There is excess H_2 flux to the
North-West where the ionisation cone crosses the ring, and we have shown it is
possible that the non-stellar continuum from the Seyfert nucleus which produces
the high excitation lines could also be causing fluorescence at the edges of
molecular clouds in the ring. The nuclear 1-0 S(1) is more extended than
previously realised but only along the bar's major axis, and we consider
mechanisms for its excitation.

Circinus X-1 through an extensive series of observational studies with the
Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite and through theoretical computer models I
developed to explore mass transfer and evolution in an eccentric binary. I
modeled the evolution of the energy spectrum during intensity dips with a
variably absorbed bright component plus a fainter unabsorbed component. I show
that variability not attributable to absorption dips is related to the
spectral/intensity states of the ``Z source'' class of low-mass X-ray binaries
(LMXBs), namely motion along (or shifts of) the horizontal, normal, and flaring
branches of the ``Z'' track in color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams. I
found rapid X-ray variability properties associated with each
spectral/intensity state: On the horizontal branch, quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) in the X-ray intensity shift in frequency from 1.3 to 35 Hz. On the
normal branch, a different QPO occurs at about 4 Hz. On the flaring branch only
strong aperiodic variability occurs. I also modeled the evolution of the energy
spectra associated with each of these branches. To study mass transfer in an
eccentric binary, I developed computer codes for transfer via Roche-lobe
overflow and from a stellar wind. I derive theoretical mass accretion profiles
and compare them to the observed profile of the X-ray intensity. In order to
explore the possible evolutionary history of Circinus X-1, I developed a
binary-evolution computer code for a neutron-star and low-mass companion in an
eccentric orbit. I use this code in a population-synthesis study to show that
the number of systems in the Galaxy expected to resemble Cir X-1 is of order
unity, consistent with its unique status as an LMXB with high eccentricity.

context of the upcoming MAP mission. We first survey the major extragalactic
foregrounds and show that discrete sources, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect,
and gravitational lensing are the most dominant ones for MAP. We then show that
MAP will detect (>5 sigma) about 46 discrete sources and 10 SZ clusters
directly with 94 GHz fluxes above 2 Jy. The mean SZ fluxes of fainter clusters
can be probed by cross-correlating MAP with cluster positions extracted from
existing catalogs. For instance, a MAP-XBACs cross-correlation will be
sensitive to clusters with S(94GHz)>200mJy, and will thus provide a test of
their virialization state and a measurement of their gas fraction. Finally, we
consider probing the hot gas on supercluster scales by cross-correlating the
CMB with galaxy catalogs. Assuming that galaxies trace the gas, we show that a
cross-correlation between MAP and the APM catalog should yield a marginal
detection, or at least a four-fold improvement on the COBE upper limits for the

release supernova energy, conserving dark and baryonic matter. Using a
potential appropriate to the large elliptical NGC 4472, we follow the evolution
of intergalactic and interstellar gas to the present time when the computed gas
density and temperature agree with X-ray observations of NGC 4472. If the hot
gas and dark matter halos are subject to differential tidal truncations or mass
exchanges between group members, then the correlation between $L_x/L_B$ and the
relative sizes of galactic X-ray images can be generated. The physical

almost all the gaseous content of the halo fragmented into massive clouds,

from the literature are employed to determine absolute values of fgas within
spheres encompassing density contrast 500 and 200 with respect to the critical

the hydrostatic, betamodel (BM), we find a temperature-dependent discrepancy in
fgas between the two methods caused by sytematic variation of the outer slope
parameter beta with temperature. There is evidence that cool clusters have a
lower mean gas fraction that hot clusters, but it is not possible to assess the
statistical significance of this effect in the present dataset. The temperature
dependance of the ICM density structure, coupled with the increase of the gas
fraction with T in the VT aproach, explains the steepening of the Lx-T
relation. The small variation about the mean gas fraction within this majority
sub-population of clusters presents an important constraint for theories of
galaxy formation and supports arguments against an Einstein-deSitter universe
based on the population mean gas fraction and primordial nucleosynthesis. The
apparent trend of lower gas fractions and more extended atmospheres in low T

  http://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/~noguchi/ftp/bulge-paper/",,"10.1086/306932","GA-98-01","astro-ph",,"  A new idea is proposed for the origin of bulges in spiral galaxies. Numerical
simulations for the protogalactic collapse suggest strongly that galactic
bulges have been assembled from massive clumps formed in the galactic disks in
their early evolutionary phase. These clumps result from the gravitational
instability of the gas-rich disks of young galaxies. Those massive clumps,
individual masses of which can be as large as one billion solar masses, are
able to spiral toward the galactic center owing to dynamical frictions within a
few Gyr. Inward transport of disk matter by this process leads to the formation
of a galactic bulge. A simple analytical model has been constructed, in which
the clumpy evolution of a disk galaxy is controlled by two parameters; the
timescale with which the primordial gas in the halo accretes onto the disk
plane (i.e., collapse timescale) and the mass fraction of the primordial gas
relative to the galaxy total mass. Under plausible assumptions for the
variation of these parameters among spiral galaxies, the clumpy evolution model
can explain the observed trend that the bulge-to-disk ratio increases as the
total mass or the internal density of the galaxy increases. This success
suggests that the clumpy evolution of the galactic disk constitutes an
important ingredient of the disk galaxy evolution. Star formation in primeval
disk galaxies takes place mostly in the clumps. Resulting knotty appearance of
these systems may explain the peculiar morphology observed in a number of
high-redshift galaxies.

methods developed on the basis of the theory of deterministic chaos. The major
difficulties are pointed out that arise when the data cannot be assumed to be
purely deterministic and the potential that remains in this situation is
discussed. For signals with weakly nonlinear structure, the presence of
nonlinearity in a general sense has to be inferred statistically. The paper
reviews the relevant methods and discusses the implications for deterministic
modeling. Most field measurements yield nonstationary time series, which poses
a severe problem for their analysis. Recent progress in the detection and
understanding of nonstationarity is reported. If a clear signature of
approximate determinism is found, the notions of phase space, attractors,
invariant manifolds etc. provide a convenient framework for time series
analysis. Although the results have to be interpreted with great care, superior
performance can be achieved for typical signal processing tasks. In particular,
prediction and filtering of signals are discussed, as well as the
classification of system states by means of time series recordings.

sampling configurations from a given Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. The method
is not based on the Metropolis concept of establishing a Markov process whose
stationary state is the wanted distribution. Instead, it starts off building
instances according to a biased distribution, but corrects for this by cloning
""good"" and killing ""bad"" configurations. In doing so, it uses the fact that
nontrivial problems in statistical physics are high dimensional. Therefore,
instances are built step by step, and the final ""success"" of an instance can be
guessed at an early stage. Using weighted samples, this is done so that the
final distribution is strictly unbiased. In contrast to evolutionary
algorithms, the cloning/killing is done without simultaneously keeping a large
population in computer memory. We apply this in large scale simulations of
homopolymers near the theta and unmixing critical points. In addition we sketch
other applications, notably to polymers in confined geometries and to randomly
branched polymers. For theta polymers we confirm the very strong logarithmic
corrections found in previous work. For critical unmixing we essentially
confirm the Flory-Huggins mean field theory and the logarithmic corrections to
it computed by Duplantier. We suggest that the latter are responsible for some
apparent violations of mean field behavior. This concerns in particular the
exponent for the chain length dependence of the critical density which is 1/2
in Flory-Huggins theory, but is claimed to be $\approx 0.38$ in several
experiments.

used to give accurate estimates for the Ising-expansion coefficients for these

to the theory of high-temperature superconductivity. In particular, we argue
that in the regime of the couplings leading to the broken SU(2) phase, the

between the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting phases. In such a phase,
a fermion mass gap appears in the theory, but there is no phase coherence, due
to the Kosterlitz-Thouless mode of symmetry breaking. The absence of

hadrons. To keep only the valence degrees of freedom, the pair creation through
the Z graphs is deleted in the connected insertions; whereas, the sea quarks
are eliminated in the disconnected insertions. This is achieved with a new
``valence QCD'' lagrangian where the action in the time direction is modified
so that the particle and antiparticle decouple. The theory has the vector and
axial $U(2N_F)$ symmetry in the particle-antiparticle space. Through lattice
simulation, it appears that this is dynamically broken down to $U_q(N_F) \times
U_{\bar{q}}(N_F)$. Furthermore, the lattice simulation reveals spin degeneracy
in the hadron masses and SU(6) relations in the ratios of $F_A/D_A, F_S/D_S$,
and $\mu^n/\mu^p$. This leads to an approximate $U_q(2N_F) \times
U_{\bar{q}}(2N_F)$ symmetry which is the basis for the valence quark model. We
find that the masses of N, $\Delta, \rho, \pi, a_1$, and $a_0$ all drop
precipitously compared to their counterparts in the quenched QCD calculation.
This is interpreted as due to the disapperance of the `constituent' quark mass
which is dynamically generated through tadpole diagrams. Form the near
degeneracy between N and $\Delta$ for the quark masses we have studied (ranging
from one to four times the strange mass), we conclude that the origin of the
hyper-fine splitting in the baryon is largely attibuted to the Goldstone boson
exchanges between the quarks. These are the consequences of lacking chiral
symmetry in valence QCD. We discuss its implication on the models of hadrons.

$10^{-4} - 10^{-1} eV^2$, vacuum neutrino oscillations can take place between
the neutrino-sphere and the weak freeze-out radius in a type II supernova.
Requiring that such oscillations are consistent with the r-process
nucleosynthesis from supernovae one can constrain the mixing of $\nu_e$ with
$\nu_{\mu}$ (or $\nu_\tau$) down to $10^{-4} eV^2$. We first do a two-flavor
study and find that the neutron rich condition $Y_e < 0.5$ is satisfied for all
values of mixing angles. However if we take the criterion $Y_e < 0.45$ for a
successful r-process and assume $\nu_\mu - \nu_e$ oscillations to be operative
then this mode as a possible solution to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is
ruled out in accordance with the recent CHOOZ result. Furthermore since we can
probe mass ranges lower than CHOOZ the narrow range that was allowed by the
CHOOZ data at 99% C.L. is also ruled out. Next we do a three-generation
analysis keeping $\Delta m_{12}^2 \sim 10^{-5} eV^2$ or $10^{-11} eV^2$ (solar
neutrino range) and $\Delta m_{13}^2 \approx \Delta m_{23}^2 \sim 10^{-4} -
10^{-1} eV^2$ (atmospheric neutrino range) and use the condition $Y_e < 0.45$
to give bounds on the mixing parameters and compare our results with the CHOOZ
bound. We also calculate the increase in the shock-reheating obtained by such
oscillations.

scattered electrons per year with energies above the initial SuperKamiokande
threshold of 6.5 MeV, or about 6.7% of the total solar neutrino signal, for an
electron neutrino flux scaled to the current SuperKamiokande counting rate. We
explore whether this might complicate efforts to extract the neutrino spectrum
from elastic scattering events and whether there might be any prospect of
combining 18O and elastic scattering events to separate charged and neutral
current interactions. Under current operating conditions the answers are no, as
the Fermi, Gamow Teller, and forbidden contributions to the 18O cross section
conspire to produce a nearly isotropic cross section. Thus most of the events
are indistinguishable from background. This result is relevant to
SuperKamiokande detection of solar antineutrinos, which arise in certain

is restricted to inclusive reactions. The time--dependent mean field method, as
developed by Kerman, Levit and Negele as well as by Reinhardt, calculates the
density for specific transitions and thus applies to exclusive reactions. It
uses the Hubbard--Stratonovich transformation to express the full
time--development operator with two--body interactions as functional integral
over one--body densities. In stationary phase approximation and with Slater
determinants as initial and final states, it defines non--Hermitian,
time--dependent mean field equations to be solved self--consistently as
boundary value problem in time. The time--independent mean field method of
Giraud and Nagarajan is based on a Schwinger--type variational principle for
the resolvent. It leads to a set of inhomogeneous, non--Hermitian equations of
Hartree--Fock type to be solved for given total energy. All information about
initial and final channels is contained in the inhomogeneities, hence the
method is designed for exclusive reactions. A direct link is established
between the time--dependent and time--independent versions. Their relation is
non--trivial due to the non--linear nature of mean field methods.

the fundamentals of Einstein's special relativity theory. Its formulation based
on introducing an inertial reference system by rigid linking of clocks to a
free entity to define proper time is self-contradictory since the operation of
rigid linking involves interaction which is excluded by definition for a free
entity. The way to overcome this inconsistency is proposed by postulating that
each free entity (object, particle) has to be ideal clocks by itself, providing
ideal internal time standards defined by the only intrinsic feature of a free
entity, namely its proper mass which means that de Broglie's periodic
phenomenon has to be considered as a fundamental principle needed to built the
special relativity, along with the principle of indistinguishability allowing
to define the particle's proper mass with ideal accuracy. Further, the internal
distance standard is provided by passing to Compton wavelength and the velocity
standard is introduced by means of Hubble's law. It is proposed to interpret
the wave function as an internal system of reference undergoing distortion when
external interaction is included.
