emission from about 40-50 Active Galactic Nuclei. Theoretical models of this
emission based on the upscattering of thermal disk photons by cooling,
relativistic electrons can successfully account for the EGRET observations, but
they predict a considerably greater X-ray flux than that actually observed in a
majority of these sources. This inconsistency may be an indication that the
particles are energized during the Compton scattering process, since the X-ray
emission is produced by the lowest energy electrons, whose density may be
relatively small due to the acceleration. Such a situation may arise as a
result of resistive field generation in electromagnetic acceleration schemes,
which we here explore. A key feature of this model is the assumed existence of
a current associated with the azimuthal component B_phi of the underlying
magnetic field by a slight imbalance in the energy distributions of outwardly
moving, relativistic electrons and protons produced at the disk surface via
shock acceleration. The generation of an electric field (via magnetic field
line reconnection) is thus required to maintain the current in the presence of
a resistivity induced by the radiative drag on the relativistic electrons. We
show that the resulting spectrum can exhibit a significant deficit of X-rays
compared with gamma-rays. In addition, due to the uni-directional flow of the
current associated with B_phi, this model would predict that the electrons are
energized relative to the protons in the outflow only on one side of the disk.
They should be decelerated on the reverse side. As such, we would anticipate
that any given blazar should have a ~50% probability of being gamma-bright,
which appears to be consistent with the observed ratio.

currently suggest the existence of dark matter with an exotic equation of state
p/rho < -1/3 that accelerates the expansion of the universe. When combined with
CMB anisotropy measurements, SN or galaxy survey data can in principle
determine the equation of state and density of this component separately,
regardless of their value, as long as the universe is spatially flat. Combining
these pairs creates a sharp consistency check. If p/rho > -1/2, then the
clustering behavior (sound speed) of the dark component can be determined so as
to test the scalar-field ``quintessence'' hypothesis. If the exotic matter
turns out instead to be simply a cosmological constant (p/rho = -1), the
combination of CMB and galaxy survey data should provide a significant
detection of the remaining dark matter, the neutrino background radiation
(NBR). The gross effect of its density or temperature on the expansion rate is
ill-constrained as it is can be mimicked by a change in the matter density.
However, anisotropies of the NBR break this degeneracy and should be detectable
by upcoming experiments.

observational characteristics of pulsar radio emission. The instabilities are
due to the interaction of the fast particles from the primary beam and the tail
of the distribution with the normal modes of a strongly magnetized
one-dimensional electron-positron plasma. The waves emitted at these resonances
are vacuum-like, electromagnetic waves that may leave the magnetosphere
directly. In this model, the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability is responsible for

emission. The conditions for the development of the cyclotron-Cherenkov

that the streaming energy of the bulk plasma is not very high $\gamma_p \approx
10$. In a typical pulsar the cyclotron-Cherenkov and Cherenkov-drift resonances
occur in the outer parts of magnetosphere at $r_{res} \approx 10^9 cm$. This
theory can account for various aspects of pulsar phenomenology including the
morphology of the pulses, their polarization properties and their spectral

high-fluence gamma-ray bursts from known supernovae is small ($<$0.2%). For the
more numerous weaker bursts, the corresponding limiting fraction of 1.5% is
less constraining due to the imprecise locations of these events. This limit
($1.5% \simeq 18$ bursts) allows that a large fraction of the recent supernovae

interpretation is always possible, for junctions between different FQH states
the fractionally charged states involved in the tunneling process are not the
Laughlin quasiparticles of the isolated FQH states that make up the junction,
and should be regarded instead as solitons of the coupled system. The charge of
the soliton is, in units of the electron charge, the harmonic average of the
filling fractions of the individual Laughlin states, which also coincides with
the saturation value of the differential conductance of the QPC. For the
especially interesting case of a QPC between states at filling fractions

exactly for all voltages and temperatures and investigate the crossovers. These
results can be tested by noise experiments on $(1,{{1/3}})$ QPCs. We present a

is achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields with

vector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which the
$\beta$-function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalous
mass dimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has the
infrared stable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. The
modified effective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the possible
occurrence of dynamical breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. This phenomenon is
related to the modification of Electrodynamics by means of the Chern-Simons
(CS) interaction polarized along a constant CS vector. Its presence makes the
vacuum optically active that has been recently estimated from astrophysical
data. We examine two possibilities for the CS vector to be time-like or
space-like, under the assumption that it originates from v.e.v. of some
pseudoscalar matter and show that only the latter one is consistent in the
framework of the AWZ model, because a time-like CS vector makes the vacuum
unstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with the finite vacuum
decay rate.

is represented by a selection of contemporary studies that focus on solving the

light and heavy pseudoscalar mesons simultaneously, and the calculation of the
electromagnetic pion form factor and the vector meson electroproduction cross
sections. These applications emphasise the qualitative importance of the
momentum-dependent dressing of elementary Schwinger functions in QCD, which
provides a unifying connection between disparate phenomena. They provide a
solid foundation for an extension of the approach to nonzero temperature and
chemical potential. The essential, formal elements of this application are
described and four contemporary studies employed to exemplify the method and
its efficacy. They study the demarcation of the phase boundary for
deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration, the calculation of bulk
thermodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the response of pi- and
rho-meson observables to T and mu. Along the way a continuum order parameter
for deconfinement is introduced, an anticorrelation between the response of
masses and decay constants to T and their response to mu elucidated, and a
(T,mu)-mirroring of the slow approach of bulk thermodynamic quantities to their
ultrarelativistic limit highlighted. These effects too are tied to the
momentum-dependent dressing of the elementary Schwinger functions.

  error in our N = 3, m = 3 analysis, leading to a much simpler set of results.
  Also, we have added a section (the penultimate one) entitled, ""Parameterized
  Families of N^{m} x N^{m} Mean Density Matrices"", having observed that the
  choice by Zyczkowski et al (quant-ph/9804024) of a uniform distribution over
  the (N-1)-dimensional simplex spanned by the eigenvalues is somewhat
  arbitrary in nature, and can be replaced by any member of a family of
  (symmetric) Dirichlet distributions",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We extend to additional probability measures and scenarios, certain of the
recent results of Krattenthaler and Slater (quant-ph/9612043), whose original
motivation was to obtain quantum analogs of seminal work on universal data
compression of Clarke and Barron. KS obtained explicit formulas for the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 2^m x 2^m density matrices derived by
averaging the m-fold tensor products with themselves of the 2 x 2 density
matrices. The weighting was done with respect to a one-parameter (u) family of
probability distributions, all the members of which are spherically-symmetric
(SU(2)-invariant) over the ``Bloch sphere'' of two-level quantum systems. For u
= 1/2, one obtains the normalized volume element of the minimal monotone
(Bures) metric. In this paper, analyses parallel to those of KS are conducted,
based on an alternative ""natural"" measure on the density matrices recently
proposed by Zyczkowski, Horodecki, Sanpera, and Lewenstein (quant-ph/9804024).
The approaches of KS and that based on ZHSL are found to yield [1 + m/2]
identical SU(2) x S_{m}-invariant eigenspaces (but not coincident eigenvalues
for m > 3). Companion results, based on the SU(3) form of the ZHSL measure, are
obtained for the twofold and threefold tensor products of the 3 x 3 density
matrices. We find a rather remarkable limiting procedure (selection rule) for
recovering from these analyses, the (permutationally-symmetrized) multiplets of
SU(3) constructed from two or three particles. We also analyze the scenarios
(all for m = 2) N = 2 x 3, N= 2 x 3 x 2, N= 3 x 2 x 2 and N = 4 and, in
addition, generalize the ZHSL measure, so that it incorporates a family of
(symmetric) Dirichlet distributions (rather than simply the uniform
distribution), defined on the (N-1)-dimensional simplex of eigenvalues.

compare the strength of a classical computer that is allowed to ask two
questions to an NP-oracle with the strength of a quantum computer that is
allowed only one such query. It is shown that any decision problem that
requires two parallel (non-adaptive) SAT-queries on a classical computer can
also be solved exactly by a quantum computer using only one SAT-oracle call,
where both computations have polynomial time-complexity. Such a simulation is
generally believed to be impossible for a one-query classical computer. The
reduction also does not hold if we replace the SAT-oracle by a general
black-box. This result gives therefore an example of how a quantum computer is
probably more powerful than a classical computer. It also highlights the
potential differences between quantum complexity results for general oracles
when compared to results for more structured tasks like the SAT-problem.
