different quasi-linear dynamical schemes based on the Zel'dovich approximation,
a Hybrid dynamical-Gaussianization method and the Path Interchange Zel'dovich
Approximation (PIZA). The final evolved density field from an N-body simulation
constitutes our test case. We use a variety of statistical measures to compare
the initial density field recovered from it to the true initial density field,
using each of the six different schemes. These include point-by-point
comparisons of the density fields in real space, the individual modes in
Fourier space, as well as global statistical properties such as the genus, the
PDF of the density, and the distribution of peak heights and their shapes. We
find linear theory to be the most inaccurate of all the schemes. The
Gaussianization scheme is the least accurate after linear theory. The two
quasi-linear dynamical schemes are more accurate than Gaussianization, although
they break down quite drastically when used outside their range of validity -
the quasi-linear regime. The complementary beneficial aspects of the dynamical
and the Gaussianization schemes are combined in the Hybrid method. We find this
Hybrid scheme to be more accurate and robust than either Gaussianization or the
dynamical method alone. The PIZA scheme performs substantially better than the
others in all point-by-point comparisons. However, it produces an oversmoothed
initial density field, with a smaller number of peaks than expected, but
recovers the PDF of the initial density with impressive accuracy on scales as
small as 3Mpc/h.

five models differ in their cosmological parameters and in the shapes and
amplitudes of their mass power spectra, they predict remarkably similar galaxy
clustering at $z=2$, 3, and 4. The galaxy correlation functions show almost no
evolution over this redshift range, even though the mass correlation functions
grow steadily in time. Despite the fairly low circular velocity threshold of
the simulations, the high redshift galaxies are usually highly biased tracers
of the underlying mass distribution; the bias factor evolves with redshift and
varies from model to model. Predicted correlation lengths for the resolved
galaxy population are $2-3\hmpc$ (comoving) at $z=3$. More massive galaxies
tend to be more strongly clustered. These CDM models have no difficulty in
explaining the strong observed clustering of Lyman-break galaxies, and some may
even predict excessive clustering. Because the effects of bias obscure
differences in mass clustering, it appears that Lyman-break galaxy clustering
will not be a good test of cosmological models but will instead provide a tool

M_sun/yr, but does not dominate the HI dynamics. Mass model fits to the

than typically found in dwarf irregular galaxies, but similar to the only other

indicates that there is little evolution between dwarf irregular and blue

galaxies identified at high redshift ($z \ga 2$) are likely to be low-mass,
bursting satellite galaxies. The abundance of LBGs as a function of redshift
and the luminosity function of LBGs both appear to be in better agreement with
the data when the starburst mode is included, especially when effects of dust
extinction are considered. The objects that we identify as LBGs have observable
properties including low velocity dispersions that are in good agreement with
the available data. In this ``Bursting Satellite'' scenario, quiescent star
formation at $z\ga2$ is relatively inefficient and most of the observed LBGs
are starbursts triggered by satellite mergers within massive halos. In
high-resolution N-body simulations, we find that the most massive dark matter
halos cluster at redshift $z\sim 3$ much as the LBGs are observed to do. This
is true for both the $\Omega=1$ CHDM model and low-$\Omega$ \LCDM and OCDM

fitting a model of the emission from a flat dusty disk to an image at
lambda=20.8 microns, we derive a disk inclination, i = 72 +6/-9 deg from face
on, with the long axis of emission at PA 28 +/-6 deg. The intensity of emission
does not decrease with radius as expected for circumstellar disks but increases
outward from the star, peaking near both ends of the elongated structure. We
simulate this appearance by varying the inner radius in our model and find an
inner hole in the disk with radius R_in = 55+/-15 AU. This value corresponds to
the radial distance of our own Kuiper belt and may suggest a source of dust in
the collision of cometesimals. By contrast with the appearance at 20.8 microns,
excess emission at lambda = 12.5 microns is faint and concentrated at the
stellar position. Similar emission is also detected at 20.8 microns in residual
subtraction of the best-fit model from the image. The intensity and ratio of
flux densities at the two wavelengths could be accounted for by a tenuous dust
component that is confined within a few AU of the star with mean temperature of
a few hundred degrees K, similar to that of zodiacal dust in our own solar
system. The morphology of dust emission from HR 4796 (age 10 Myr) suggests that
its disk is in a transitional planet-forming stage, between that of massive
gaseous proto-stellar disks and more tenuous debris disks such as the one

somewhat less than in the ring, but higher than in the remainder of the disk.
The integrated far-infrared emission from NGC 891 is dominated by small
particles shortwards of 100 microns. Longwards of 100 micron, the emission can
be equally well fitted by a single population of large dust grains at 21 K, or
a bimodal population of grains at temperatures of 18 K and 27 K. The
circumnuclear disk is at a temperature of at least 50 K, and probably much
higher.

photospheric helium in mass fraction is 0.243 and the sound speed square
difference between the Sun and the model is < 1%. This model leads to a
reestimate of the neutrinos fluxes : 7.18 SNU for the chlorine experiment,

nuclear reaction rates, CNO abundances and microscopic diffusion. We conclude
that the standard model in side its inherent uncertainties, is robust in the
light of the present acoustic mode detection and that the neutrino fluxes
prediction is not well constrained.

short range interactions so that their magnetic moments are parallel or
antiparallel to each other at temperatures (T) much smaller than the coupling

crystal lattice, the molecules are well separated from each other and the
active part of the Hamiltonian at k_B*T << J is H=-D*S_z^2, so that up and down
spins states have identical energies, and S_z can escape from one state to the
other via either over-the-barrier motion, or tunneling. So far, the escape rate
Gamma in HSM was found to have smooth T dependence throughout the cooling
process from DS^2 << k_B*T to k_B*T << D*S^2. In this case, the transition from
the over-the-barrier motion to tunneling, is referred to as second-order
transition. In the present work, we use the muon spin relaxation technique to
show evidence for temperature-independent tunneling at k_B*T << D*S^2, in zero
applied magnetic field (ZF), in the HSM CrNi6. Moreover, the crossover from the
classical to quantum regime is sharp, and appears to be consistent with a first
order transition of the escape rate. In a first order transition,
over-the-barrier motion is abruptly replaced by tunneling between ground
states, as the temperature is lowered down to the barrier height.

the plot of their density profiles and the study of their overlaps with the
Jain wave functions in a meaningful basis. We find that the exact bulk and edge
excitations are very well reproduced by the Jain states; these, in turn, can be
described by the multi-component Abelian conformal theory. Most notably, we
observe that the edge excitations form sub-families of the low-lying states
with a definite pattern, which is explained by the W-infinity minimal conformal
theory. Actually, the two conformal theories are related by a projection
mechanism whose effects are observed in the spectrum. Therefore, the edge

angular momentum $L$ the system behaves as the original model, showing a
complete collapse at low energies and an entropy with a convex intruder. For
intermediate values of $L$ the collapse at low energies is not complete and the

equilibrium conductance shows a structure close to $0.7(2e^2/h)$, and in
consolidating our previous work [K.~J. Thomas et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 135
(1996)] this 0.7 structure has been investigated in a wide range of samples as
a function of temperature, carrier density, in-plane magnetic field
$B_{\parallel}$ and source-drain voltage $V_{sd}$. We show that the 0.7
structure is not due to transmission or resonance effects, nor does it arise
from the asymmetry of the heterojunction in the growth direction. All the 1D
subbands show Zeeman splitting at high $B_{\parallel}$, and in the wide channel
limit the $g$-factor is $\mid g \mid \approx 0.4$, close to that of bulk GaAs.
As the channel is progressively narrowed we measure an exchange-enhanced
$g$-factor. The measurements establish that the 0.7 structure is related to
spin, and that electron-electron interactions become important for the last few
conducting 1D subbands.

general-purpose detectors H1 and ZEUS in electron-proton interactions with 300
GeV center-of-mass energy at the HERA accelerator complex have stimulated great
interest in the question of whether perturbative QCD (pQCD) can provide an
accurate description of such diffractive processes. The high flux of quasi-real
photons from the 27.5 GeV electron beam has allowed high-statistics studies of
vector-meson photoproduction to be compared to the deeply inelastic processes
at high photon virtuality Q^2 >> \Lambda^2_QCD. Special-purpose electron
detectors at small scattering angle have been used to identify a transition
region, 0.2 < Q^2 < 2 GeV^2, where the pQCD prediction for the dominance of
point-like configurations of qqbar-pairs is verified. Data samples
characterized by high momentum transfer to the 820 GeV initial-state proton, 1
< |t| < 13 GeV^2, have now become available, and the results lend support to
the proposition that pQCD calculations should accurately describe the inelastic
vector-meson production processes in high-|t| photoproduction. Measurements of
the energy dependence and the t-dependence of the elastic cross sections for
rho, omega, phi, and J/psi production have provided tests of the proposal that
the mass (or size) of the vector meson provides a third scaling variable for
studying the transition to the domain of pQCD applicability. A preliminary
result on elastic upsilon production has also been announced by the ZEUS
collaboration. These issues of scale will be discussed in the context of
topical phenomenological models, comparing the HERA results and those from
fixed-target experiments at lower energy to the wealth of calculations

important ingredient for modeling high energy cosmic ray air showers. In this
paper, we present a new approach to simulate hadronic interactions, including
hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus scattering, in the energy
range roughly between 10^11 and 10^17 eV. Such collisions are very complex,
being composed of many components, and therefore some strategy is needed to
construct a reliable model. The central point of our approach is the
hypothesis, that the behavior of high energy interactions is universal
(universality hypothesis). So, for example, the hadronization of partons in
nuclear interactions follows the same rules as the one in electron-positron
annihilation ; the radiation of off-shell partons in hadronic collisions is
based on the same principles as the one in deep inelastic scattering. We
construct a model for hadronic interactions in a modular fashion. The
individual modules, based on the universality hypothesis, are identified as
building blocks for more elementary interactions (like e^+ e^-, lepton-proton),
and can therefore be studied in a much simpler context. With these building
blocks under control, we can provide a quite reliable model for
nucleus-nucleus, hadron-nucleus and hadron-hadron scattering, providing in
particular very useful tests for the complicated numerical procedures using
Monte Carlo techniques.

create a non-vanishing overlap with the wave function of physical quarkonium.
Several observed features that are difficult to understand in current models
find simple explanations. Transverse gluon exchange produces unpolarized

anomalous dependence of the J/psi cross section on the nuclear target size can

were found. The role of the offshell behaviour of nucleon-resonance couplings

Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for two equal mass spin 1/2 particles (like the
deuteron) is solved in the cm-frame for a covariant separable interaction
kernel. For that purpose the BSE is transformed to an eigenvalue problem which
is diagonalized numerically. The Bethe--Salpeter amplitudes (BSAs) are obtained
straightforwardly from the resulting eigenvectors. Only positive parity
solutions of the eigenvalue problem are considered. To correlate the BSAs to
standard quantum mechanical wavefunctions, the corresponding
equal-time-wavefunctions (ETWs) are calculated. A decomposition of BSAs and
ETWs in partial waves in angular momenta and parity is performed. As a first
application elastic electron-deuteron-scattering in the impulse approximation
(IA) is considered. The charge, magnetic and quadrupole formfactors $F_C(k^2)$,
$F_M(k^2)$, $F_Q(k^2)$ and tensor polarizations $\tilde{t}_{20}(k^2)$, $t_{20}
(k^2,\theta_e=70^{\circ})$ are obtained from three independent matrix elements
of the deuteron current in the Breit-frame of elastic
electron-deuteron-scattering. Additionally, the formfactors $A(k^2)$ and
$B(k^2)$ of the Rosenbluth formula are calculated.

nontrivial way. Assuming the particles as distinguishable, there are indeed
four modes of fragmentation into two clusters, while in the standard three-body
problem there are three possible two-cluster partitions and conversely the
four-body problem has seven different possibilities. It is shown how to
formulate the pion-three-nucleon collision problem through the
integral-equation approach by taking into account the proper fragmentation of
the system. The final result does not depend on the assumption of separability
of the two-body t-matrices. Then, the quasiparticle method a' la
Grassberger-Sandhas is applied and effective two-cluster connected-kernel
equations are obtained. The corresponding bound-state problem is also
formulated, and the resulting homogeneous equation provides a new approach
which generalizes the commonly used techniques to describe the three-nucleon
bound-state problem, where the meson degrees of freedom are usually suppressed.

physics. However, its application to turbulence faces several technical
difficulties, which have had to be circumvented by uncontrolled approximations.
Indeed, in view of the deterministic nature of the Navier-Stokes equations, it
is clear that the operation of averaging out the high-wavenumber modes while
keeping the low-wavenumber modes constant, cannot be done rigorously and in
itself can only be an approximation.
  With points like this in mind, we have recently adopted direct numerical
simulation as a tool for probing the basic feasibility of using RG techniques
to reduce the number of degrees of freedom requiring to be numerically
simulated. In this paper, we present some of the first results of this
approach.
