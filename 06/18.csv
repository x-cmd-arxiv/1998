  Reconstruction Method","72 pages including 33 figures, submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/306429","OSU-TA98-9","astro-ph",,"  In reconstruction analysis of galaxy redshift surveys, one works backwards
from the observed galaxy distribution to the primordial density field in the
same region, then evolves the primordial fluctuations forward in time with an
N-body code. This incorporates assumptions about the cosmological parameters,
the properties of primordial fluctuations, and the biasing relation between
galaxies and mass. These can be tested by comparing the reconstruction to the
observed galaxy distribution, and to peculiar velocity data. This paper
presents a hybrid reconstruction method that combines the `Gaussianization''
technique of Weinberg(1992) with the dynamical schemes of Nusser & Dekel(1992)
and Gramann(1993). We test the method on N-body simulations and on N-body mock
catalogs that mimic the depth and geometry of the Point Source Catalog Redshift
Survey and the Optical Redshift Survey. This method is more accurate than
Gaussianization or dynamical reconstruction alone. Matching the observed
morphology of clustering can limit the bias factor b, independent of Omega.
Matching the cluster velocity dispersions and z-space distortions of the
correlation function xi(s,mu) constrains the parameter beta=Omega^{0.6}/b.
Relative to linear or quasi-linear approximations, a fully non-linear
reconstruction makes more accurate predictions of xi(s,mu) for a given beta,
thus reducing the systematic biases of beta measurements and offering further
scope for breaking the degeneracy between Omega and b. It also circumvents the
cosmic variance noise that limits conventional analyses of xi(s,mu). It can
also improve the determination of Omega and b from joint analyses of redshift
  & peculiar velocity surveys as it predicts the fully non-linear peculiar
velocity distribution at each point in z-space.

core collapse by adopting three-body binary heating. Effects of the shocks are
included by adding the tidal shock diffusion coefficients to the ordinary
Fokker-Planck equation: the first order heating term, <dE>, and the second
order energy dispersion term, <dE^2>. As an example, we investigate the
evolution of models for the globular cluster NGC 6254. Using the Hipparcos
proper motions, we are now able to construct orbits of this cluster in the
Galaxy. Tidal shocks accelerate significantly both core collapse and the
evaporation of the cluster and shorten the destruction time from 24 Gyr to 18
Gyr. We examine various types of adiabatic corrections and find that they are
critical for accurate calculation of the evolution. Without adiabatic
corrections, the destruction time of the cluster is twice as short.
  We examine cluster evolution for a wide range of the concentration and tidal
shock parameters, and determine the region of the parameter space where tidal
shocks dominate the evolution. We present fitting formulae for the core
collapse time and the destruction time, covering all reasonable initial
conditions. In the limit of strong shocks, the typical value of the core
collapse time decreases from 10 t_{rh} to 3 t_{rh} or less, while the
destruction time is just twice that number. The effects of tidal shocks are
rapidly self-limiting: as clusters lose mass and become more compact, the
importance of the shocks diminishes. This implies that tidal shocks were more
important in the past.

and clumpy interstellar medium. Unlike typical dwarf irregular galaxies, these
Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies exhibit strong central concentrations in
their neutral gas distributions which may provide a clue to the origin of their
strong star-burst activity. Furthermore, while all of the systems do appear to
be rotating, based on observed velocity gradients, the kinematics are complex.
All systems have non-ordered kinematic structure at some level; some of the
extended gas is not necessarily kinematically connected to the main system.
  The observed gas distributions and kinematics place constraints on
evolutionary scenarios for BCDs. Evolutionary links between BCDs, dwarf
irregulars, and dwarf ellipticals have been postulated to explain their high
star formation rates and low luminosity, low metallicity nature. The BCDs
appear to have higher central mass concentrations in both gas and stellar
content than the dwarf irregulars, indicating that evolutionary scenarios
connecting these two classes will require mass redistribution. In addition, the
fact that BCDs are rotationally supported systems indicates that BCDs are
unlikely to evolve into dwarf ellipticals without substantial loss of angular
momentum. Thus, while such evolutionary scenarios may still be possible with
the aid of mergers or tidal interactions, the isolated nature of BCDs suggests
that the majority of BCDs will not fade to become objects similar to the
present day dwarf ellipticals.

search for the cosmic infrared background (CIB) radiation. Scattered light and
thermal emission from the interplanetary dust (IPD) are major contributors to
the diffuse sky brightness at most infrared wavelengths. Accurate removal of
this zodiacal light foreground is a necessary step toward a direct measurement
of the CIB. The zodiacal light foreground contribution in each of the 10 DIRBE
wavelength bands ranging from 1.25 to 240 microns is distinguished by its
apparent seasonal variation over the whole sky. This contribution has been
extracted by fitting the brightness calculated from a parameterized physical
model to the time variation of the all-sky DIRBE measurements over 10 months of
observations. The model brightness is evaluated as the integral along the line
of sight of the product of a source function and a three-dimensional dust
density distribution function. The dust density distribution is composed of
multiple components: a smooth cloud, three asteroidal dust bands, and a
circumsolar ring near 1 A.U. By using a directly measurable quantity which
relates only to the IPD cloud, we exclude other contributors to the sky
brightness from the IPD model. Using the IPD model described here, high-quality
maps of the infrared sky with the zodiacal foreground removed have been
generated. Imperfections in the model reveal themselves as low-level systematic
artifacts in the residual maps which correlate with components of the IPD. The
most evident of these artifacts are located near the ecliptic plane in the
mid-infrared, and are less than 2% of the zodiacal foreground brightness.
Uncertainties associated with the model are discussed, including implications

unambiguously owing to the sharpness of the first peak of the pair correlation
functions. Upon structural rearrangements, they break collectively in the form
of clusters whose sizes grow with lowering the temperature $T$. The bond life
time $\tau_b$, which depends on $T$ and the shear rate $\gdot$, is on the order
of the usual structural or $\alpha$ relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ in weak
shear $\gdot \tau_{\alpha} \ll 1$, while it decreases as $1/\gdot$ in strong
shear $\gdot\tau_{\alpha} \gg 1$ due to shear-induced cage breakage.
Accumulated broken bonds in a time interval ($\sim 0.05\tau_b$) closely
resemble the critical fluctuations of Ising spin systems. For example, their
structure factor is well fitted to the Ornstein-Zernike form, which yields the
correlation length $\xi$ representing the maximum size of the clusters composed
of broken bonds. We also find a dynamical scaling relation, $\tau_b \sim
\xi^{z}$, valid for any $T$ and $\gdot$ with $z=4$ in two dimensions and $z=2$
in three dimensions. The viscosity is of order $\tau_b$ for any $T$ and
$\gdot$, so marked shear-thinning behavior emerges. The shear stress is close
to a limiting stress in a wide shear region. We also examine motion of tagged
particles in shear in three dimensions. The diffusion constant is found to be
of order $\tau_b^{-\nu}$ with $\nu=0.75 \sim 0.8$ for any $T$ and $\gdot$, so
it is much enhanced in strong shear compared with its value at zero shear. This
indicates breakdown of the Einstein-Stokes relation in accord with experiments.
Some possible experiments are also proposed.

investigated by means of the variational Monte Carlo method. The energy gain of
the d-wave SC state, obtained as the difference of the minimum energy with a
finite gap and that with zero gap, was examined with respect to dependences on
U, electron density rho and next nearest neighbor transfer t' mainly on the 10
x 10 lattice. It was found to be maximized around U = 8 (in energy unit of t).
It sharply increased for negative values of t' and had a broad peak for t' ~
-0.10. For these values of t' the energy gain was a smooth increasing function
of rho almost independent of the shell structure in the region starting from ~
0.76 up to 0.92. This clearly indicates that the result is already close to the
value in the bulk limit. For t' = 0, the energy gain depended on the electronic
shell state. Competition between the SC and the SDW states was also
investigated. When t' = 0, the ground state is SDW in the range of rho \geq ~
0.84$. The SC region slightly extends up to ~ 0.87 for t' ~ -0.10. Consequently
the present results strongly indicate that the 2DH with t' ~ -0.1 drives SC by
itself in the rho region from ~ 0.76 to ~ 0.87. The energy gain in the SC state
with suitable parameters is found to be in reasonable agreement with the
condensation energy in the SC state of YBa2Cu3O7. The corresponding t-J model
proves to give an order-of-magnitude larger energy gain, which questions its
validity.

Our ability to investigate the thermodynamics relies heavily upon the

potential for the GUT modulus is generated at 2 loops, and slopes away from the
origin for a wide range of parameters. This potential is stabilized by
Planck-suppressed operators in the Kahler potential, and the GUT scale is fixed
to be of order M_* / (4\pi^2) (where M_* ~ 10^{18} GeV is the reduced Planck
scale) independently of the supersymmetry breaking scale. The cosmology of this
scenario is acceptable if there is an epoch of inflation with reheat
temperature small compared to the supersymmetry-breaking scale. We construct a

SU(6), and solves the doublet-triplet splitting problem by a sliding singlet
mechanism. The GUT sector contains no dimensionful couplings or tuned
parameters, and all mass scales other than the Planck scale are generated

We show that the sphaleron constraint can be evaded for m_H up to 100 GeV if a
B_Y\gsim 0.3 T^2 exists at the time of the EW phase transition, thus
resurrecting the possibility for baryogenesis within the minimal standard model
(provided enough CP violation can be obtained). We estimate that for m_H\gsim
100 GeV the Higgs condendsate behaves like a type II superconductor with
Z-vortices penetrating the bubble. Also, for such high Higgs masses the minimum

render the W-field unstable towards forming a condensate which changes the
simple picture of the symmetry breaking.

continuous invariant probability measure, where $a$ is in a certain positive

periodic attractors as well as non-periodic maps whose critical orbit is
absorbed by the continuation of any prescribed hyperbolic repeller of $f_a$. In
particular, Misiurewicz maps are dense in $\mathcal{A}$. Almost all maps $f_a$
in the quadratic family is known to possess a unique natural measure, that is,
an invariant probability measure $\mu_a$ describing the asymptotic distribution
of almost all orbits. We discuss weak*-(dis)continuity properties of the map
$a\mapsto \mu_a$ near the set $\mathcal{A}$, and prove that almost all maps in
$\mathcal{A}$ have the property that $\mu_a$ can be approximated with measures
supported on periodic attractors of certain nearby maps. On the other hand, for
any $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and any periodic repeller $\Gamma_a$ of $f_a$, the
singular measure supported on $\Gamma_a$ can also approximated with measures
supported on nearby periodic attractors. It follows that $a\mapsto \mu_a$ is

the value of the ratio $C_{P}/C_{A}$ by using the calculated matrix elements.
Surprisingly enough, all the abovementioned shell-model results suggest a very
small value ($\simeq 0$) for $C_{P}/C_{A}$, quite far from the PCAC prediction

disturbing anomaly is solved by employing effective transition operators. This

formation of the surface causes the growth of the GE during the process of
fragmentation. This quantity then characterizes the MF and confirms the crucial
role of deterministic chaos in filling the new available phase-space: at
variance with the exact time evolution, no entropy change is found when the
linear response is applied. Numerical simulations were used also to extract
information about final temperatures of the fragments. From a fitting of the
momentum distribution with a Fermi-Dirac function we extract the temperature of
the fragments at the end of the process. We calculate also the gas temperature
by averaging over the available phase space. The latter is a few times larger
than the former, indicating a gas not in equilibrium. Though the model is very
schematic, this fact seems to be very general and could explain the discrepancy
found in experimental data when using the slope of light particles spectra
instead of the double ratio of isotope yields method in order to extract the
nuclear caloric curve.
