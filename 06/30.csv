nearby radio quasar B2 1028+313, which is located in the cD galaxy at the
center of the Abell cluster A1030. We also analyze archival ROSAT PSPC
observations. We find that the X-ray emission is dominated by the quasar. The
flux varied by a factor of about two between the ROSAT HRI and ASCA
observations, which were about one year apart. The X-ray spectrum of the quasar
is fit by a single power-law, except at low energies where there is a soft
excess. Although the shape of the soft excess is not strongly constrained, it
can be fit by a blackbody with a temperature of about 30 eV. There was evidence
for extended X-ray emission, which contributed about 25% of the total flux.
However, this emission does not appear to be normal X-ray emission from
intracluster gas or a central cooling flow. The extended X-ray emission appears
to be quite soft; if its spectrum is modeled as thermal emission, the
temperature is ~0.2 keV, rather than the 5-10 keV expected for ICM emission.
The radial surface distribution of the emission was not fit by either the beta
model which usually describes ICM emission, or by a cooling flow model. The
ASCA and ROSAT spectra showed no convincing evidence for a thermal component
with a cluster-like temperature, either in the overall spectral shape or in
emission lines. In addition, the ROSAT PSPC image showed that the extended
X-ray emission was highly elongated to the NNW and SSE, in the same direction
as the extended radio emission from the quasar. We suggest that the extended
emission is inverse Compton emission from the extended radio lobes.

the molecular gas is in rotating nuclear rings or disks with radii 300 to 800
pc. Most of the CO flux comes from a moderate-density, warm, intercloud medium
rather than self-gravitating clouds. Gas masses of ~ 5 x 10^9 Msun, 5 times
lower than the standard method are derived from a model of the molecular disks.
The ratio of molecular gas to dynamical mass, is M_gas/M_dyn ~ 1/6 with a
maximum ratio of gas to total mass surface density of 1/3. For the galaxies
VIIZw31, Arp193, and IRAS 10565+24, there is good evidence for rotating
molecular rings with a central gap. In addition to the rotating rings a new
class of star formation region is identified which we call an Extreme
Starburst. They have a characteristic size of only 100 pc., about 10^9 Msun of
gas and an IR luminosity of ~3 x 10^11 Lsun. Four extreme starbursts are
identified in the 3 closest galaxies in the sample Arp220, Arp193 and Mrk273.
They are the most prodigious star formation events in the local universe, each
representing about 1000 times as many OB stars as 30 Doradus. In Arp220, the CO
and 1.3 mm continuum maps show the two ``nuclei'' embedded in a central ring or
disk and a fainter structure extending 3 kpc to the east, normal to the nuclear
disk. There is no evidence that these sources really are the pre-merger nuclei.
They are compact, extreme starburst regions containing 10^9 Msun of dense
molecular gas and new stars, but no old stars. Most of the dust emission and
HCN emission arises in the two extreme starbursts. The entire bolometric
luminosity of Arp~220 comes from starbursts, not an AGN. In Mrk231, the disk
geometry shows that the molecular disk cannot be heated by the AGN; the far IR
luminosity of Mrk~231 is powered by a starburst, not the AGN. (Abridged)

and $M_{\rm vir}$ of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), where $M_{\rm vir}$ and
$L$ are the virial mass and the total luminosity of a dSph, respectively. We
used 11 dSphs in the Local Group as the sample. We find two distinct sequences
on the $M_{\rm vir}/L$--$M_{\rm vir}$ plane: $M_{\rm vir}/L\propto M_{\rm
vir}^{2.0}$ for dSphs with $M_{\rm vir}<10^8M_\odot$, whereas $M_{\rm
vir}/L\simeq$ constant for $M_{\rm vir}>10^8M_\odot$. A ``discontinuity'' is
seen at $M_{\rm vir}\simeq 10^8M_\odot$. We interpret the ``discontinuity'' as
the threshold for the gas in dSphs to be blown away by successive supernovae.
If a dSph has virial mass (most of which is dark mass) less than $10^8M_\odot$,
the gas is blown away, while in a dSph of larger mass, the deep potential well
prevents the blow-away mechanism from working effectively. Thus, large mass
ratio of dark matter (DM) to baryonic matter (i.e., large $M_{\rm vir}/L$) is
realized in a low-mass ($M_{\rm vir}<10^8M_\odot$) dSph through the gas
depletion, whereas $M_{\rm vir}/L$ becomes lower in high-mass ($M_{\rm
vir}>10^8M_\odot$) dSphs. We further make an attempt to explain the above
relation for the low-mass dSphs, $M_{\rm vir}/L\propto M_{\rm vir}^{2.0}$,
based on estimate of cooling time, using the scaling laws of virial
temperature, virial mass and radius of a dSph and assuming that the heating by
OB-star radiation terminates the star formation activity. We succeed in
deriving the above relation for the mass-to-light ratio and luminosity.

mean ratio along 26 lines of sight of N(xray)/N(H,21cm) = 0.972 +- 0.022. This
is significantly less than the anticpated ratio of 1.23, which would occur if
He were half He I and half He II in the warm ionized component. We suggest that
the ionized component out of the plane is highly ionized, with He being mainly
He II and He III. In the limiting case that H is entirely HI, we place an upper
limit on the He abundance in the ISM of He/H <= 0.103.
  At column densities N(xray) > 5x10^20 cm^-2, which occurs at our lower
latitudes, the X-ray absorption column N(xray) is nearly double N(H,21cm). This
excess column cannot be due to the warm ionized component, even if He were
entirely He I, so it must be due to a molecular component. This result implies
that for lines of sight out of the plane with |b| ~ 30 degrees, molecular gas
is common and with a column density comprable to N(H,21cm).
  This work bears upon the far infrared background, since a warm ionized
component, anticorrelated with N(H,21cm), might produce such a background. Not
only is such an anticorrelation absent, but if the dust is destroyed in the
warm ionized gas, the far infrared background may be slightly larger than that
deduced by Puget et al. (1996).

deconvolution technique on these pre-COSTAR images to achieve post-COSTAR
quality. Three PNe imaged before and after COSTAR confirm the high reliability
of our deconvolution procedure. We derive morphological classes, dimensions,
and surface photometry for all these PNe. We have combined this sample with
HST/PC1 images of 15 MCPNe, three of which are in common with the FOC set,
acquired by Dopita et al. (1996), to obtain the largest MCPN sample ever
examined from the morphological viewpoint. By using the whole database,
supplemented with published data from the literature, we have analyzed the
properties of the MCPNe and compared them to a typical, complete galactic
sample. Morphology of the MCPNe is then correlated with PN density, chemistry,

to treat the structural instability of spatially localized and time-periodic
solutions associated with an unperturbed autonomous Hamiltonian.
  The mechanism of instability is radiative decay, due to resonant coupling of
the discrete modes to the continuum modes by the time-dependent perturbation.
This results in a slow transfer of energy from the discrete modes to the
continuum. The rate of decay of solutions is slow and hence the decaying bound
states can be viewed as metastable. The ideas are closely related to the
authors' work on (i) a time dependent approach to the instability of
eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectra, and (ii) resonances, radiation
damping and instability in Hamiltonian nonlinear wave equations. The theory is
applied to a general class of Schr\""odinger equations. The phenomenon of
ionization may be viewed as a resonance problem of the type we consider and we
apply our theory to find the rate of ionization, spectral line shift and local
decay estimates for such Hamiltonians.

that achieving textual economy imposes strong requirements on the

must support the generator's simultaneous consideration of syntax and

at any stage how the hearer will interpret the current sentence, with its

spin correlation develops that is consistent with the resonance between a

masses have the attractive property that they conserve baryon and lepton number
exactly in the Lagrangian. In this talk, I review the recent results valid for
a large class of minimal versions of the model that supersymmetry combined with
the requirement that the ground state of the model conserve electric charge
constrains the mass of the right handed $W_R$ boson to be in a certain range
i.e. $M_{W_R}\leq$ 10 TeV or $\geq 10^{10}$ GeV. In the former case (low
$M_{W_R}$), the vacuum breaks R-parity spontaneously and the latter case (high
$M_{W_R}$) is required if vacuum is to conserve R-parity. In the second case,
the effective low energy theory is the MSSM with exact R-parity, nonvanishing
neutrino masses and a pair of light doubly charged Higgs fields and their
fermionic partners. Exact R-parity conservation via see saw mechanism therefore
implies that the neutrino masses must be in the desired range to solve the

parallelism to what might be expected of M theory HS gauge theories describe
infinite towers of fields of all spins and possess naturally space-time SUSY
and Chan-Paton type inner symmetries. In this paper, we analyze at the level of
the equations of motion the simplest non-trivial HS model which describes HS
gauge interactions (on the top of the usual supergravitational and
(Chern-Simons) Yang-Mills interactions) of massive spin-0 and spin-1/2 matter
fields in d=2+1 AdS space-time. The parameter of mass of the matter fields is
identified with the vev of a certain auxiliary field in the model. The matter
fields are shown to be arranged into d3 N=2 massive hypermultiplets in certain
representations of $U(n)\times U(m)$ Yang-Mills gauge groups. Discrete
symmetries of the full system are studied, and the related N=1 supersymmetric
truncations with O(n) and Sp(n) Yang-Mills symmetries are constructed. The
simplicity of the model allows us to elucidate some general properties of the
HS models. In particular, a new result, which can have interesting implications
to the higher-dimensional models, is that our model is shown to admit an

quantum gravity where space-time is fractal: the intrinsic Hausdorff dimension
of usual 2d Euclidean quantum gravity is four, and not two. However, certain
aspects of quantum space-time remain two-dimensional, exemplified by the fact
that its so-called spectral dimension is equal to two.

is proposed. Its starting point is an effective Lagrangian of the interaction
between the vector meson and the quarks inside the baryon, which generates the
non-diffractive s- and u- channel resonance contributions. Additional t-channel
$\pi^0$ and $\sigma$ exchanges are included for the $\omega$ and $\rho^0$
production respectively to account for the large diffractive behavior in the
small $t$ region as suggested by Friman and Soyeur. The numerical results are
presented for the $\omega$ and $\rho$ productions in four isospin channels with
the same set of parameters, and they are in good agreement with the available
data not only in $\omega$ and $\rho^0$ productions but also in the charged
$\rho$ productions where the additional t-channel $\sigma$ exchange does not
contribute so that it provides an important test to this approach. The
investigation is also extended to the $\phi$ photoproduction, and the initial
results show that the non-diffractive behavior of the $\phi$ productions in the
large $t$ region can be described by the s- and u- channel contributions with
significantly smaller coupling constants, which is consistent with the findings
in the similar studies in the QHD framework. The numerical investigation has
also shown that polarization observables are essential for identifying
so-called ""missing resonances"".

mass numbers A = 100 - 132, in terms of the free nucleon--nucleon interaction
as obtained from meson--exchange theory. This amounts to first calculating an
effective interaction in which the free interaction is modified by the presence
of the appropriate nuclear medium. The short--range correlations are included
within the framework of Brueckner theory yielding the nuclear reaction matrix
and the long--range correlations by using the reaction matrix in many--body
perturbation theory to obtain an effective interaction. The resulting effective
interaction is then employed in calculating the nuclear properties. Particular
emphasis is placed on the ability of our calculation to describe systematic
trends of the properties of these nuclei. Both successful achievements and
problematic features are pointed out.

as the upper fluid, we find a square planform close to onset which undergoes a
secondary bifurcation to rolls at higher temperature differences. The scale of
the convection pattern is that of the thinner lower fluid layer for which
buoyancy and surface tension forces are comparable. The wavenumber of the
pattern near onset agrees with the prediction of the linear stability analysis
for the full two-layer problem. The square planform is in qualitative agreement
with recent one- and two-layer nonlinear theories, which fail however to
predict the transition to rolls.

incompressible flow with zero correlation time in Batchelor limit can be mapped
exactly to a certain quantum-mechanical system with a finite number of degrees
of freedom. The Schroedinger equation is derived and its solution is analyzed
for the case when at the beginning the scalar has Gaussian statistics with
correlation function of the form $e^{-|x-y|^2}$. Any equal-time correlation
function of the scalar can be expressed via the solution to the Schroedinger
equation in a closed algebraic form. We find that the scalar is intermittent
during its decay and the average of $|\theta|^\alpha$ (assuming zero mean value
of $\theta$) falls as $e^{-\gamma_\alpha Dt}$ at large $t$, where $D$ is a
parameter of the flow, $\gamma_\alpha=\alpha(6-\alpha)/4$ for $0<\alpha<3$, and
$\gamma_\alpha=9/4$ for $\alpha \geq 3$, independent of $\alpha$.

finite number of parties sharing a physical system of finite dimensional
Hilbert space a new entanglement magnitude is introduced for its pure and mixed
states: robustness. It corresponds to the minimal amount of mixing with locally
prepared states which washes out all entanglement. It quantifies in a sense the
endurence of entanglement against noise and jamming. Its properties are studied
comprehensively. Analytical expressions for the robustness are given for pure
states of binary systems, and analytical bounds for mixed states of binary
systems. Specific results are obtained mainly for the qubit-qubit system. As
byproducts local pseudomixtures are generalized, a lower bound for the relative
volume of separable states is deduced and arguments for considering convexity a
necessary condition of any entanglement magnitude are put forward.
