depth toward the galactic center on galactic model parameters is explored in
detail for a distribution of stars consisting of the Zhao (1996) bar and
nucleus and the Bahcall and Soneira (1980) double exponential disk. The high
sensitivity of these two microlensing measures to the circular velocity model,
velocity dispersions, bulge mass, direction of the line of sight, bar axis
orientation, star spatial distribution and the stellar mass function means no
single galaxy property can be constrained very well without constraining most
of the others. The model time scale frequency distributions are compared with
that determined empirically by the MACHO group throughout. Although the MACHO
empirical data are matched quite well with a nominal velocity model and with a
mass function only of hydrogen burning stars that varies as m^{-2.2} to
m^{-2.5} in the M star region, uncertainties in galactic structure, kinematics
and content together with the paucity of published microlensing data preclude
any claim of the model representing the real world. A variation of the mass
function \sim m^{-1} in the M star region obtained from recent star counts,
both local and in the galactic bulge, fails to yield a sufficient number of
short time scale events compared to the MACHO data. The high sensitivity of the
microlensing measures to the direction of the line of sight may mean that
sufficient microlensing data is already in hand to constrain the bar
distribution of stars. The procedure developed here for determining the time
scale frequency distribution is particularly convenient for rapidly
incorporating model changes as data from all sources continues to accumulate.

in eclipse minimum times excludes the presence of very massive planets with
periods of less than a few years. The lightcurve was visually scanned for the
presence of unusual events which may be indicative of transits of extrasolar
planets with 'massive earth' sizes. Six suspicious events were found which are
being followed up for future transits, by planets with sizes between 1.5 and
2.5 RE (Earth Radii). However, none of these events has amplitudes compatible
with planets larger than 2.5 RE. Coplanar planets larger than 2.5 RE and with
orbital periods of less than 60 days can therefore be ruled out with a
confidence of about 80%. Planets smaller than 1.5 RE cannot be detected in the
data without a sub-noise detection algorithm. A preliminary signal detection
analysis shows that there is a 50% detection confidence for 2 RE planets with a
period from 10 to 30 days with the current data. This data-set demonstrates
that it is possible to detect terrestrial sized planets with ground based
photometry, and that strong constraints on the sizes of planets orbiting in the

and are perturbations of linear dispersive equations. The unperturbed dynamical
system has a bound state, a spatially localized and time periodic solution. We
show that, for generic nonlinear Hamiltonian perturbations, all small amplitude
solutions decay to zero as time tends to infinity at an anomalously slow rate.
  In particular, spatially localized and time-periodic solutions of the linear
problem are destroyed by generic nonlinear Hamiltonian perturbations via slow
radiation of energy to infinity. These solutions can therefore be thought of as
metastable states.
  The main mechanism is a nonlinear resonant interaction of bound states
(eigenfunctions) and radiation (continuous spectral modes), leading to energy
transfer from the discrete to continuum modes.
  This is in contrast to the KAM theory in which appropriate nonresonance
conditions imply the persistence of invariant tori. A hypothesis ensuring that
such a resonance takes place is a nonlinear analogue of the Fermi golden rule,
arising in the theory of resonances in quantum mechanics. The techniques used
involve: (i) a time-dependent method developed by the authors for the treatment
of the quantum resonance problem and perturbations of embedded eigenvalues,
(ii) a generalization of the Hamiltonian normal form appropriate for infinite
dimensional dispersive systems and (iii) ideas from scattering theory. The
arguments are quite general and we expect them to apply to a large class of
systems which can be viewed as the interaction of finite dimensional and
infinite dimensional dispersive dynamical systems, or as a system of particles
coupled to a field.

possibility of substantial flavor symmetry breaking in the proton sea. This is
confirmed by pp and pD Drell-Yan processes measured at FNAL. Theoretical models
used to `prove' flavor symmetry breaking rely on the assumption of charge
symmetric parton distributions. Substantial charge symmetry violation [CSV]
could affect current tests of flavor symmetry. In this review we examine the
possibility of CSV for parton distributions. We first give definitions for
structure functions without making the usual assumption of charge symmetry.
Next we make estimates of CSV for both valence and sea quark distributions. We
list a set of relations which must hold if charge symmetry is valid, and review
current experimental limits on CSV. We propose a series of experimental tests
of charge symmetry. These tests could either detect CSV, or they could provide
stronger upper limits on CSV effects. We discuss CSV contributions to sum
rules, and we propose sum rules which could differentiate between flavor
symmetry, and charge symmetry violation in nuclear systems.

symmetry that is spontaneously broken by the Higgs sector. We study in detail
at the tree level models with three Higgs doublets, and with six Higgs doublets
comprising two weakly coupled sets of three. In a leading approximation of
$S_3$ cyclic permutation symmetry the three Higgs model gives a ``democratic''
mass matrix of rank one, while the six Higgs model gives either a rank one mass
matrix, or in the case when it spontaneously violates CP, a rank two mass
matrix corresponding to nonzero second family masses. In both models, the CKM
matrix is exactly unity in leading approximation. Allowing small explicit
violations of cyclic permutation symmetry generates small first family masses
in the six Higgs model, and first and second family masses in the three Higgs

second family quarks are naturally larger than mixings involving the third
family. Complete numerical fits are given for both models, flavor changing

symmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature, from a model which includes $\rho
$, $\sigma $, $\omega $ and $\pi $ mesons. The behavior of rho mesons inside
the medium is first discussed using different schemes to extract a finite
contribution from the vacuum polarization. These schemes give qualitatively
different results for the in-medium rho mass. The results are discussed in
connection with the non-renormalizability of the model. We next study the
modified potential as density increases. In the intermediate distance range, it
is qualitatively modified by matter and vacuum effects. In the long-distance
range ($r>2$ fm), one observes the presence of oscillations, which are not
present in free-space. Features on this distance range are insensitive to the
renormalization scheme.

features are studied by means of shell model calculations for nucleons in a
high-j intruder orbital. The presence of an odd-nucleon shifts the frequency of
the alignment of two nucleons of the other kind along the axis of rotation. It
is shown that the anomalous delayed crossing observed in nuclei with aligning
neutrons and protons occupying the same intruder subshell can be partly
attributed to these residual interactions.

$\gamma$, to virtual photons with $Q^2>0$. The dominant low energy cross
sections are represented in our calculation by one-pion-loop graphs of
relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory and the $\Delta(1232)$-resonance
excitation. For the proton we find good agreement of the calculated
$\Sigma_p(Q^2)$ with empirical values obtained from integrating up
electroproduction data for $Q^2<0.4 GeV^2$. The proton spin-polarizability
$\gamma_p(Q^2)$ switches sign around $Q^2= 0.4 GeV^2$ and it joins smoothly the
""partonic"" curve, extracted from polarized deep-inelastic scattering, around
$Q^2=0.7 GeV^2$. For the neutron our predictions of $\Sigma_n(Q^2)$ and
$\gamma_n(Q^2)$ agree reasonably well at $Q^2=0$ with existing determinations.
Upcoming (polarized) electroproduction experiments will be able to test the
generalized polarizability sum rules investigated here.

evolution, self-organised criticality and presents a model of his own to arrive
at a conclusion that self-organised criticality is not necessary for evolution.
Not only did he miss a key model (Ecolab) that has a clear self-organised
critical mechanism, but also Newman's model exhibits the same mechanism that
gives rise to power law behaviour as does Ecolab. Newman's model is, in fact, a
``mean field'' approximation of a self-organised critical system. In this
paper, I have also implemented Newman's model using the Ecolab software,
removing the restriction that the number of species remains constant. It turns
out that the requirement of constant species number is non-trivial, leading to
a global coupling between species that is similar in effect to the species
interactions seen in Ecolab. In fact, the model must self-organise to a state
where the long time average of speciations balances that of the extinctions,
otherwise the system either collapses or explodes. In view of this, Newman's
model does not provide the hoped-for counter example to the presence of
self-organised criticality in evolution, but does provide a simple, almost
analytic model that can used to understand more intricate models such as
Ecolab.

that equivalent results are provided by the theories of spontaneous

faster process of decoherence. We show that, as an additional benefit, the
assumption of spontaneous fluctuation makes it possible to genuinely derive
thermodynamics from mechanics, namely, without implicitly assuming
thermodynamics.
