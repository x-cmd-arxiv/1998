white dwarfs and M dwarfs has been studied. High-extinction areas towards the
Orion A, Serpens and rho Oph cloud complexes were observed, covering a volume
corresponding to 464 pc3 in the solar neighbourhood, complete to Mv=16.5.
Foreground stars were selected by VRI photometry and photometric parallaxes.
  The resulting foreground sample consists of 21 M dwarfs and 7 white dwarfs.
The derived M-dwarf luminosity function is consistent with previous studies,
showing no substantial upturn beyond Mv=16. The 7 white dwarfs imply a local
density of 0.013(+-0.005)Msun/pc3 (~15% of the dynamical mass in the solar
neighbourhood) supporting other recent results but obtained with a completely
different method.
  For the clouds, foreground-star data were used to derive independent cloud
distances, while the background stars and a simple model of the Milky Way gave
reliable cloud extinctions.

search for an isotropic CIB in ten photometric bands from 1.25 to 240 microns.
The results of that search are presented here. Conservative limits on the CIB
are obtained from the minimum observed brightness in all-sky maps at each
wavelength, with the faintest limits in the DIRBE spectral range being at 3.5
microns (\nu I_\nu < 64 nW/m^2/sr, 95% CL) and at 240 microns (\nu I_\nu < 28
nW/m^2/sr, 95% CL). The bright foregrounds from interplanetary dust scattering
and emission, stars, and interstellar dust emission are the principal
impediments to the DIRBE measurements of the CIB. These foregrounds have been
modeled and removed from the sky maps. Assessment of the random and systematic
uncertainties in the residuals and tests for isotropy show that only the 140
and 240 microns data provide candidate detections of the CIB. The residuals and
their uncertainties provide CIB upper limits more restrictive than the dark sky
limits at wavelengths from 1.25 to 100 microns. No plausible solar system or
Galactic source of the observed 140 and 240 microns residuals can be
identified, leading to the conclusion that the CIB has been detected at levels
of \nu I_\nu = 25+-7 and 14+-3 nW/m^2/sr at 140 and 240 microns respectively.
The integrated energy from 140 to 240 microns, 10.3 nW/m^2/sr, is about twice
the integrated optical light from the galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field,
suggesting that star formation might have been heavily enshrouded by dust at
high redshift. The detections and upper limits reported here provide new
constraints on models of the history of energy-releasing processes and dust
production since the decoupling of the cosmic microwave background from matter.

synchrotron peak frequency of the spectral energy distribution. The unification
scheme is based on the angle Theta that describes the orientation of the
relativistic jet and on the electron kinetic luminosity Lambda of the jet. We
assume that Lambda scales with the size of the jet r in a self-similar fashion
(Lambda propto r^2), as supported by observational data. The jets are
self-similar in geometry and have the same pressure and median magnetic field
at the inlet, independent of size. The self-similarity is broken for the
highest energy electrons, which radiate mainly at high frequencies, since for
large sources they suffer more severe radiative energy losses over a given
fraction of the jet length. We calculate the optically thin synchrotron
spectrum using an accelerating inner jet model based on simple relativistic gas
dynamics and show that it can fit the observed infrared to X-ray spectrum of
PKS 2155--304. We couple the accelerating jet model to the unification scheme
and compare the results to complete samples of
  BLs. The negative apparent evolution of X-ray selected BLs is explained as a
result of positive evolution of the jet electron kinetic luminosity
$\Lambda_{kin}$. We review observational arguments in favor of the existence of
scaled-down accretion disks and broad emission-line regions in BLs. The
proposed unification scheme can explain the lack of observed broad emission
lines in X-ray selected BLs, as well as the existence of those lines
preferentially in luminous radio-selected BLs. Finally, we review observational
arguments that suggest the extension of this unification scheme to all blazars.

quasar and the IRAS source is extremely unlikely and we argue that the optical

through main sequence stars at least as faint as $M_{V} = 13.5$. Stars this low
in luminosity have masses below $0.15 M_{\odot}$. A modest white dwarf (WD)
cooling sequence is also observed commencing slightly fainter than $M_V = 10$

terminating near $M_V = 14.6$. The observed WDs follow quite closely a
theoretical cooling sequence for $0.7 M_{\odot}$ pure carbon core WDs with
hydrogen-rich atmospheres (DA WDs). The cooling time to an $M_V$ of 14.6 for
such WDs is 4.3 Gyr which we take as the WD cooling age of the cluster. A fit
of a set of isochrones to the cluster CMD indicates a turnoff age of 4.0 Gyr.
The excellent agreement between these results suggests that ages derived from
white dwarf cooling should be considered as reliable as those from other dating
techniques. The WDs currently contribute about 9% of the total cluster mass but
the number seen appears to be somewhat low when compared with the number of

the initial linear power spectrum of density fluctuations contains a feature

Y_2Ba_4Cu_7O_{15} by means of a bilayer Hubbard model with inequivalent planes.
  We evaluate the spin response, effective interaction and the intra- and
interplane spin-spin relaxation times within the fluctuation exchange
approximation. We show that strong in-plane antiferromagnetic fluctuations are
responsible for a magnetic coupling between the planes, which in turns leads to
a tendency of the fluctuation in the two planes to equalize.
  This equalization effect grows whit increasing in-plane antiferromagnetic
fluctuations, i. e., with decreasing temperature and decreasing doping, while
it is completely absent when the in-layer correlation length becomes of the
order of one lattice spacing. Our results provide a good qualitative
description of NMR and NQR experiments in Y_2Ba_4Cu_7O_{15}.

in stoichiometric NaV2O5. This anomaly decreases and gradually disappears with
deviation from stoichiometry in Na(1-x}V2O5 (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04).
This behavior is compared with that of pure and Zn-doped CuGeO3 where only
modest kinks in the k(T) curves are observed at the spin-Peierls transition.
The change of k at critical temperature Tc could be partially attributed to the
opening of an energy gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum excluding the
scattering of thermal phonons on spin fluctuations. However, the reason for
such a strong anomaly in the k(T) may lie not only in the different energy
scales of CuGeO3 and NaV2O5, but also in the different character of the phase
transition in NaV2O5 which can have largely a structural origin, e.g. connected
with the charge ordering.

the decay B0_d(t) -> Lambda LambdaBar (BR ~ 10-6), Lambda -> p pi- these

the latter solving the discrete ambiguity alpha -> pi/2 -alpha. For beta one

can be useful in the search of CP violation beyond the Standard Model. Because
of the small total rates, the study of these modes could only be done in future
high statistics experiments. Also, in the most interesting case Lambda
LambdaBar the time dependence of the asymmetry can be difficult to reconstruct.

LambdaBar, is useful to look for CP violation in Lambda decay. We also discuss
B0_d(t) -> J/Psi K*0 -> l+ l- K_S pi0 where the secondary decays conserve
parity, and angular correlations allow to determine terms of the form
cos(delta)cos(2beta), delta being a strong phase. This phase has been measured
by CLEO, but we point out that a discrete ambiguity prevents to determine
sign(cos(2beta)). However, if one assumes small strong phases, like in
factorization and as supported by CLEO data, one could have information on
sign(cos(2beta)). Similar remarks can be done for cos(2alpha) in the decay

breakdown, space-time uncertainty principle, and background independence may
play an important role in constructing and understanding matrix models. First,
we show that the space-time uncertainty principle of string may be understood
as a manifestation of the breakdown of the topological symmetry in the large
$N$ matrix model. Next, we construct a new type of matrix models which is a
matrix model analog of the topological Chern-Simons and BF theories. It is of
interest that these topological matrix models are not only completely
independent of the background metric but also have nontrivial ""p-brane""
solutions as well as commuting classical space-time as the classical solutions.
In this paper, we would like to point out some elementary and unsolved problems
associated to the matrix models, whose resolution would lead to the more
satisfying matrix model in future.

a similarity transformation. Divergences in the similarity flow equations may
be handled with dimensional regularization in this approach, and the resulting
effective Hamiltonian is finite since states well-separated in energy are
uncoupled. Specific schemes developed several years ago by Glazek and Wilson
and contemporaneously by Wegner correspond to particular choices within this
framework, and the relative merits of such choices are discussed from this
vantage point. It is shown that a scheme for the transformation of Hamiltonians
introduced by Dyson in the early 1950's also corresponds to a particular choice
within the similarity renormalization framework, and it is argued that Dyson's
scheme is preferable to the others for ease of computation. As an example, it
is shown how a logarithmically confining potential arises simply at second
order in light-front QCD within Dyson's scheme, a result found previously for
other similarity renormalization schemes. Steps toward higher order and
nonperturbative calculations are outlined. In particular, a set of equations
analogous to Dyson-Schwinger equations is developed.

naturally isomorphic to a class of twisted modules representing quantum

classes using string duality arguments. These constructions yield simple proofs
of the O(d,d;Z) Morita equivalences between $d$-dimensional noncommutative tori

duality group of toroidally compactified string theory. We classify the
automorphisms of the twisted modules and construct the most general gauge
theory which is invariant under the automorphism group. We compute bosonic and
fermionic actions associated with these gauge theories and show that they are
explicitly duality-symmetric. The duality-invariant gauge theory is manifestly
covariant but contains highly non-local interactions. We show that it also
admits a new sort of particle-antiparticle duality which enables the

a magnetostatic trap of metastable neon atoms by spin-polarizing the atoms.
Suppression of the ionization is critical for the possibility of reaching
Bose-Einstein condensation with such atoms. We estimate the relevant long-range
interactions for the system, consisting of electric quadrupole-quadrupole and
dipole-induced dipole terms, and develop short-range potentials based on the
Na_2 singlet and triplet potentials. The auto-ionization widths of the system
are also calculated. With these ingredients we calculate the ionization rate
for spin-polarized and for spin-isotropic samples, caused by anisotropy of the
long-range interactions. We find that spin-polarization may allow for four
orders of magnitude suppression of the ionization rate for Ne. The results
depend sensitively on a precise knowledge of the interaction potentials,
however, pointing out the need for experimental input. The same model gives a
suppression ratio close to unity for metastable xenon in accordance with
experimental results, due to a much increased anisotropy in this case.

two-level atoms in a photonic bandgap material, each with an atomic resonant
frequency near the edge of the gap. In the limit of a low initial occupation of
the excited atomic state, our system is shown to possess novel atomic spectra
and population statistics. For a high initial excited state population, mean
field theory suggests a fractionalized inversion and a macroscopic polarization
for the atoms in the steady state, both of which can be controlled by an
external d.c. field. This atomic steady state is accompanied by a non--zero
expectation value of the electric field operators for field modes located in
the vicinity of the atoms. The nature of homogeneous broadening near the band
edge is shown to differ markedly from that in free space due to non-Markovian
memory effects in the radiation dynamics. Non-Markovian vacuum fluctuations are
shown to yield a partially coherent steady state polarization with a random
phase. In contrast with the steady state of a conventional laser, near a
photonic band edge this coherence occurs as a consequence of photon
localization in the absence of a conventional cavity mode. We also introduce a
classical stochastic function with the same temporal correlations as the

  Matrices""",,,,"quant-ph",,"  We apply and extend recent results of Krattenthaler and Slater
(quant-ph/9612043), who sought quantum analogs of seminal work on universal
data compression of Clarke and Barron. KS obtained explicit formulas for the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 2^m x 2^m density matrices gotten by
averaging the m-fold tensor products with themselves of the 2 x 2 density
matrices. The weighting was done with respect to a one-parameter family of
probability distributions, all the members of which are spherically-symmetric
over the ""Bloch sphere"" of two-level quantum systems. This family includes the
normalized volume element of the minimal monotone (Bures) metric. In this
letter, we conduct parallel analyses (for m =2,3,4), based on a natural measure
on the density matrices recently proposed by Zyczkowski, Horodecki, Sanpera and
Lewenstein (quant-ph/9804024) and find interesting similarities and differences
with the findings of KS. In addition, we are able to obtain exact analogous
results, based on the measure of ZHSL, for the twofold tensor products of the 3
x 3 density matrices.

was extensively done after Shannon by several authors like Kolmogor ov and
Gelfand. In quantum systems, there have been several definitions of t he mutual
entropy for classical input and quantum output. In 1983, the autho r defined
the fully quantum mechanical mutual entropy by means of the relati ve entropy
of Umegaki, and he extended it to general quantum systems by the relative
entropy of Araki and Uhlmann. When the author introduced the quantu m mutual
entropy, he did not indicate that it contains other definitions of the mutual
entropy including classical one, so that there exist several misu nderstandings
for the use of the mutual entropy (information) to compute the capacity of
quantum channels. Therefore in this note we point out that our quantum mutual
entropy generalizes others and where the m isuse occurs.

presented. Energy-time entangled photon-pairs are measured using two-channel
analyzers, leading to a violation of the inequalities by 16 standard deviations
without subtracting accidental coincidences. Subtracting them, a 2-photon
interference visibility of 95.5% is observed, demonstrating that distances up
to 10 km have no significant effect on entanglement. This sets quantum
cryptography with photon pairs as a practical competitor to the schemes based
on weak pulses.
