Shapley Concentration supercluster, is a chain formed by the ACO clusters
A3556, A3558 and A3562 and the two poor clusters SC 1327-312 and SC 1329-313.
  We find a large number of clumps, indicating that strong dynamical processes
are active. In particular, it is necessary to use a fully three-dimensional
sample(i.e. using the galaxy velocity as third coordinate) in order to recover
also the clumps superimposed along the line of sight. Even if a great number of
detected substructures were already found in a previous analysis (Bardelli et
al. 1998), this method is more efficient and faster when compared with the use
of a wide battery of tests and permits the direct estimate of the detection
significance. Almost all subclusters previously detected by the wavelet
analyses found in the literature are recognized by DEDICA.
  On the basis of the substructure analysis, we also briefly discuss the origin
of the A3558 complex by comparing two hypotheses: 1) the structure is a
cluster-cluster collision seen just after the first core-core encounter; 2)
this complex is the result of a series of incoherent group-group and
cluster-group mergings, focused in that region by the presence of the
surrounding supercluster. We studied the fraction of blue galaxies in the
detected substructures and found that the bluest groups reside between A3562
and A3558, i.e. in the expected position in the scenario of the cluster-cluster
collision.

dust-enshrouded massive star-formation in very distant galaxies, previously
hidden activity to which even the faintest optical images are insensitive. We
present the deepest sub-mm survey of the sky to date, taken with the SCUBA
camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and centred on the Hubble Deep
Field. The high source density found in this image implies that the survey is
confusion-limited below a flux density of 2 mJy. However, within the central 80
arcsec radius independent analyses yield 5 reproducible sources with S(850um) >
2 mJy which simulations indicate can be ascribed to individual galaxies. We
give positions and flux densities for these, and furthermore show using
multi-frequency photometric data that the brightest sources in our map lie at
redshifts z~3. These results lead to integral source counts which are
completely inconsistent with a no-evolution model, and imply that massive
star-formation activity continues at redshifts > 2. The combined brightness of
the 5 most secure sources in our map is sufficient to account for 30 - 50% of
the previously unresolved sub-mm background, and we estimate statistically that
the entire background is resolved at about the 0.3 mJy level. Finally we
discuss possible optical identifications and redshift estimates for the
brightest sources. One source appears to be associated with an extreme
starburst galaxy at z~1, whilst the remaining four appear to lie in the
redshift range 2 < z < 4. This implies a star-formation density over this
redshift range that is at least five times higher than that inferred from the
ultraviolet output of HDF galaxies.

understand the supernova are in contrast to what is expected for such massive

possibly the consequence of a collapsar (Woosley 1993, 1996). Indeed a more
likely explanation for what was seen is a highly asymmetric explosion in which
the GRB was produced by a relativistic jet, perhaps viewed obliquely, and only
a fraction of the total stellar mass was ejected, the remainder accreting into
a black hole. The ejected mass (but not the 56Ni mass), explosion energy, and

viz., $n_{ext}\propto R^{-k}$, we analytically study the effects of the
first-order radiative correction and the nonuniformity of the medium on a GRB
afterglow. We first derive a new relation among the observed time, the shock
radius and the fireball's Lorentz factor: $t_\oplus=R/4(4-k)\gamma^2c$, and
also derive a new relation among the comoving time, the shock radius and the

further derive new scaling laws both between the X-ray flux and observed time

discuss the afterglows of GRB 970228 and GRB 970616, and find that if the

caused by the accumulation of massive particles near the centre of multimass
systems, destroy these equilibria if the aforementioned quantities are kept
fixed. The time-scale for this to happen was found to be remarkably short (a
few dynamical times when $N= 2500$) in systems undergoing violent relaxation.
The time taken to achieve thermal equilibrium depended on the initial
conditions and could be comparable to a dynamical time (even when the
conditions for violent relaxation were not satisfied) or the two body
relaxation time. The relaxation time for velocity anisotropies was intermediate
between these two time-scales, being long compared to the dynamical time but
much (about four times) shorter than the time-scale of energy relaxation.

Unlike the typical case for Fano-resonance, the discrete state here is outside
the continuum; we use uniaxial stress to tune its position with respect to the
onset of the continuum. State-of-the art calculations of absorption spectra
show that as the discrete state approaches the continuum, a doublet structure
forms which reveals anticrossing behaviour. The minimum separation energy of
the anticrossing depends characteristically on the well width and is unusually
large for narrow wells. This offers striking evidence for the strong underlying
valence-band mixing. Moreover, it proves that previous explanations of similar

energy is 6286_{-6}^{+15} MeV. Our results are generally in agreement with the
earlier calculations. However, we find the two lowest 1^{+} states to be very
close to the j-j limit, in agreement with the NRQCD lattice calculations, but
at odds with many of the earlier phenomenological calculations. The
implications of this finding for the photon spectra of the 1P and 2S states are

reaction $^7$Be$(p,\gamma)^8$B, the primary source of high-energy solar
neutrinos in the solar $pp$ chain. Using simple models we explore the model
dependence in the extrapolation of the experimental data to the region of
astrophysical interest near 20 keV. We find that below approximately 400 keV
the energy dependence is very well understood and constrained by the data for
the elastic scattering of low energy neutrons from $^7$Li. Above 400 keV
nuclear distortion of the wave function of the incident proton introduces a
significant model dependence. This is particularly important for the s-wave
contribution to the $S$ factor. The extracted value of S(0) is $19.0 \pm 1.0
\pm 0.2$~eVb. The first error is experimental while the second is an estimate
of the theoretical error in the extrapolation.

  The saturation properties of nuclear matter are reproduced as well as the
results of the Dirac-Br\""{u}ckner theory. Our numerical results show that the
kaon effective mass might be changed only moderately in the nuclear medium due
to the highly non-linear density effects. After taking into account the
coupling between the omega meson and the kaon, we obtain similar results for
the effective kaon and antikaon energies as calculated in the
one-boson-exchange model while in our model the parameters of the kaon-nuclear
interactions are constrained by the SU(3) chiral symmetry.

wavefunctions for the internal atomic motion of the D3O+ ion. The polarization
force field models of Stillinger, et al and of Ojamae, et al. were used.
Initial pair product wavefunctions were obtained from the asymptotic high
temperature many-body density matrix after contraction to atom pairs using
Metropolis Monte Carlo. Subsequent characterization shows these pair product
wavefunctions to be well optimized for atom pair correlations despite that fact
that the predicted zero point energies are too high. The pair product
wavefunctions are suitable to use within variational Monte Carlo, including
excited states, and density matrix Monte Carlo calculations. Together with the
pair product wavefunctions, the traditional variational theorem permits
identification of wavefunction features with significant potential for further
optimization. The most important explicit correlation variable found for the
D3O+ ion was the vector triple product {\bf r}$_{OD1}\cdot$({\bf
r}$_{OD2}\times${\bf r}$_{OD3}$). Variational Monte Carlo with 9 of such
explicitly correlated functions yielded a ground state wavefunction with an
error of 5-6% in the zero point energy.

swept out by a periodic orbit. Furthermore, a class of cyclic states are
