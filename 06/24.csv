of photometry is about 0.01 mag, and astrometry 0.15 arcsec (with possible

are also presented.
  The maps of the SMC are the first from the series of similar maps covering
other OGLE fields: LMC, Galactic bulge and Galactic disk. The data are very

neglected photometrically for years. Because of potentially great impact on
many astrophysical fields we decided to make the SMC data available to the

of a dusty interstellar medium have been included with particular care. A
chemical evolution code follows the star formation rate, the gas fraction and
the metallicity, basic ingredients for the stellar population synthesis. The
latter is performed with a grid of integrated spectra of simple stellar
populations (SSP) of different ages and metallicities, in which the effects of
dusty envelopes around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are included. The
residual fraction of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star
forming molecular clouds and the cirrus. The relative amount is a model
parameter. The molecular gas is sub--divided into clouds of given mass and
radius: it is supposed that each SSP is born within the cloud and progressively
escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star forming molecular clouds is
computed with a radiative transfer code. The cirrus emission is derived by
describing the galaxy as an axially symmetric system, in which the local dust
emissivity is consistently calculated as a function of the local field
intensity due to the stellar component. Effects of very small grains, subject
to temperature fluctuations, as well as PAHs are included. The model is
compared and calibrated with available data of normal and starburst galaxies in
the local universe, in particular new broad--band and spectroscopic ISO
observations. It will be a powerful tool to investigate the star formation, the
IMF, supernovae rate in nearby starbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to
predict the evolution of luminosity functions of different types of galaxies at

the virial expectation of r_eff ~ sigma_0^2 <Sigma>_eff^-1 at all optical and
near-infrared wavelengths, which could be a result of the variation of M/L
along the elliptical galaxy sequence, or a systematic breakdown of homology
among the family of elliptical galaxies. The slope of the near-infrared FP
excludes metallicity variations as the sole cause of the slope of the FP. Age
effects, dynamical deviations from a homology, or any combination of these
(with or without metallicity), however, are not excluded. The scatter of both
the near-infrared and optical FP are nearly identical and substantially larger
than the observational uncertainties, demonstrating small but significant
intrinsic cosmological scatter for the FP at all wavelengths. The lack of a
correlation of the residuals of the near-infrared FP and the residuals from the
Mg_2-sigma relation indicates that the thickness of these relations cannot be
ascribed only to age or metallicity effects. Due to this metallicity
independence, the small scatter of the near-infrared FP excludes a model in
which age and metallicity effects ``conspire'' to keep the optical FP thin. All
of these results suggest that the possible physical origins of the FP relations
are complicated due to combined effects of variations of stellar populations
and structural parameters among elliptical galaxies.

throughout the Local Group. In terms of the limiting flux to produce detectable
H-alpha emission (4-10 x 10**3 phot/cm**2/s), the four dominant galaxies (M31,
Galaxy, M33, LMC) have spheres of influence which occupy a small fraction
(<10%) of the Local Volume. There are at least two possible sources of
ionization whose influence could be far more pervasive: (i) a cosmic background
of ionizing photons; (ii) a pervasive warm plasma throughout the Local Group.
The COBE FIRAS sky temperature measurements permit a wide variety of plasmas
with detectable ionizing fields. It has been suggested (Blitz et al. 1996;
Spergel et al. 1996; Sembach et al. 1995, 1998) that a substantial fraction of
high velocity clouds are external to the Galaxy but within the Local Group.
Deep H-alpha detections are the crucial test of these claims and, indeed,
provide a test bed for the putative Local Group corona.

surveys, shows a strong peak at a redshift of z=1.5, which implies that we have
already seen most of the formation. High redshift galaxies may, however, emit
most of their energy at submillimeter wavelengths if they contain substantial
amounts of dust. The dust would absorb the starlight and reradiate it as
far-infrared light, which would be redshifted to the submillimeter range. Here
we report a deep survey of two blank regions of sky performed at submillimeter
wavelengths (450 and 850-micron). If the sources we detect in the 850-micron
band are powered by star formation, then each must be converting more than 100
solar masses of gas per year into stars, which is larger than the maximum star
formation rates inferred for most optically-selected galaxies. The total amount
of high redshift star formation is essentially fixed by the level of background
light, but where the peak occurs in redshift for the submillimeter is not yet
established. However, the background light contribution from only the sources
detected at 850-micron is already comparable to that from the
optically-selected sources. Establishing the main epoch of star formation will
therefore require a combination of optical and submillimeter studies.

restricted to the matter model ``dust'', provides successful models of
large-scale structure in the Universe in the laminar regime, i.e., where the
fluid flow is single-streamed and ``dust''-shells are smooth. Beyond the epoch
of shell-crossing a qualitatively different behavior is expected, since in
general anisotropic stresses powered by multi-stream forces arise in
collisionless matter. In this paper we provide the basic framework for the
modeling of pressure-supported fluids, thus restricting attention to isotropic
stresses and to the cases where pressure can be given as a function of the
density. We derive the governing set of Lagrangian evolution equations and
study the resulting system using Lagrangian perturbation theory. We discuss the
first-order equations and compare them to the Eulerian theory of gravitational
instability, as well as to the case of plane-symmetric collapse. We obtain a
construction rule that allows to derive first-order solutions of the Lagrangian
theory from known first-order solutions of the Eulerian theory and so extend
Zel'dovich's extrapolation idea into the multi-streamed regime. These solutions
can be used to generalize current structure formation models in the spirit of
the ``adhesion approximation''.

0.800 have to be considered together in modelling these stars.

local dynamic spin and charge correlation functions of the one-dimensional
Kondo insulator are discussed. Excitation gaps open with decreasing temperature
and the gaps take different values depending on channels. The excitation
spectra change qualitatively around the characteristic temperature
corresponding to the spin gap which is the lowest energy scale of the Kondo
insulator.

multiple-stage inflationary scenario that can generate a primordial spectrum of
adiabatic density perturbations with a break at $k_b \simeq 0.05 h Mpc^{-1}$.
The presence of such a break is supported by the APM galaxy survey data. We
consider a specific model within this scenario and confront it with
observational data. We reproduce the angular power spectrum of CMB
anisotropies, and also account for the break in the power spectrum of galaxy
clustering. In addition, we find a value for $\sigma_8$ in agreement with the
one deduced from observations. A characteristic property of the spectrum is a
drop of the spectral index from $n \simeq 1$ to $n \sim 0.6$ at $k \sim k_b$.

effective model and, together with the CFT corresponding to $S^3$, provide a
statistical interpretation of the corresponding Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We
test the proposed exact black hole entropy, which should hold to all orders in
$\alpha^\prime$, by an independent field theoretical analysis including
higher-order curvature corrections. We find consistent results that yield a
renormalization of the classical parameters, only. In addition we find a
logarithmic subleading black hole entropy coming from gravitational fivebrane

general. We realize the equilibrium measure as the invariant measure of a
loss-network process whose existence is ensured by a subcriticality condition
of a dominant branching process. In this regime, the approach yields, besides
existence and uniqueness of the measure, properties such as exponential space
convergence and mixing, and a central limit theorem. The loss network converges
exponentially fast to the equilibrium measure, without metastable traps. This
convergence is faster at low temperatures, where it leads to the proof of an
asymptotic Poisson distribution of contours. Our results on the mixing
properties of the measure are comparable to those obtained with
``duplicated-variables expansion'', used to treat systems with disorder and
coupled map lattices. It works in a larger region of validity than usual
cluster-expansion formalisms, and it is not tied to the analyticity of the
pressure. In fact, it does not lead to any kind of expansion for the latter,
and the properties of the equilibrium measure are obtained without resorting to
combinatorial or complex analysis techniques.

an integral involving a product of two off-shell two-body decay widths. This
``angle-average'' approximation is used to calculate the $\pi NN$ decay width
of the $d^*(J^\pi=3^+, T=0)$ dibaryon in a simple $\Delta^2$ model for the most
important Feynman diagrams describing pion emissions with baryon-baryon recoil
and meson retardation. The decay width is found to be about 0.006 (0.07, 0.5)
MeV at the $d^*$ mass of 2065 (2100, 2150) MeV for input dynamics derived from
the Full Bonn potential. The smallness of this width is qualitatively
understood as the result of the three-body decay being ``third forbidden''. The
concept of $\ell$ forbiddenness and the threshold behavior of a three-body
decay are further studied in connection with the $\pi NN$ decay of the dibaryon
$d'(J^\pi=0^-, T=0 or 2)$ where the idea of unfavorness has to be introduced.
The implications of these results are briefly discussed.

quadrupole-quadrupole interaction and single-particle splittings chosen so as
to obtain the SU(3) results. Elliott had shown that such an interaction gives
rotational bands for which the energies go as I(I+1). This is certainly true
for eve-even and for odd-even or even-odd nuclei with $K\neq 1/2$. We have
looked at odd-odd nuclei e.g $^{22}Na$ and found somewhat different behaviour.
In $^{22}Na$ the $I=1^+_1 T=0$ and $I=0^+_1 T=1$ states are degenerate, and a
rotational band built on the $I=0^+_1 T=1$ state behaves in a normal fashion.
For the $I+1^+_1 T=0$ band however, we find that the energy is given by
$E(I)-E(1^+_1)=AI(I+1)$. This differs from the `normal' behaviour which would
be $E(I)-E(1^+_1)=AI(I+1)-2A$.

protons in the initial state gets excited to $\Delta $. This, in the second
step, decays into a nucleon and a pion. For the $pp \to N\Delta$ step the
parametrized form of the DWBA t-matrix of Jain and Santra, which reproduces
most of the available data on $pp \to n\Delta^{++}$, is used. The
cross-sections studied include the outgoing proton momentum spectra in
coincidence with the pion, the outgoing pion momentum spectra and the
integrated total cross-section. We find that all the calculated numbers are in

Ewald, kubic-harmonic expansions, or Lekner sums are commonly used to calculate
long-range electrostatic interactions in computer simulations of polar and
charged substances. The calculation of pressures in such systems is
investigated. We find that the virial and thermodynamic pressures differ
because of the explicit volume dependence of the effective, resummed Ewald
potential. The thermodynamic pressure, obtained from the volume derivative of
the Helmholtz free energy, can be expressed easily for both ionic and rigid
molecular systems. For a system of rigid molecules, the electrostatic energy
and the forces at the atom positions are required, both of which are readily
available in molecular dynamics codes. We then calculate the virial and
thermodynamic pressures for the extended simple point charge (SPC/E) water
model at standard conditions. We find that the thermodynamic pressure exhibits
considerably less system size dependence than the virial pressure. From an
analysis of the cross correlation between the virial and thermodynamic
pressure, we conclude that the thermodynamic pressure should be used to drive
volume fluctuations in constant-pressure simulations.

compact device structure compared with the FEL and therefore, may be
interesting for applications in different wavelength ranges: from submillimeter

between two events and none of them is directly causally influenced by the
other, then there must exist a third event that can, as a common cause, account
for the correlation. The EPR-Bell paradox consists in the problem that we
observe correlations between spatially separated events in the EPR-experiments,
which do not admit common-cause-type explanation; and it must therefore be
inevitably concluded, that, contrary to relativity theory, in the realm of
quantum physics there exists action at a distance, or at least superluminal
causal propagation is possible; that is, either relativity theory or
Reichenbach's common cause principle fails. By means of closer analyses of the
concept of common cause and a more precise reformulation of the EPR
experimental scenario, I will sharpen the conclusion we can draw from the
violation of Bell's inequalities. It will be explicitly shown that the
correla-tions we encounter in the EPR experiment could have common causes; that
is, Reichen-bach's Common Cause Principle does not fail in quantum mechanics.
Moreover, these common causes satisfy the locality conditions usually required.
In the Revised Version of the paper I added a Postscript from which it turns
out that the solution such obtained is, contrary to the original title,
incomplete. It turns out that a new problem arises: some combinations of the
common cause events do statistically cor-relate with the measurement
operations.

number of iterations of order $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the

is shown here that an improved quantum search algorithm can be devised that
exploits the structure of a tree search problem by nesting this standard search
algorithm. The number of iterations required to find the solution of an average
instance of a constraint satisfaction problem scales as $\sqrt{d^\alpha}$, with
a constant $\alpha<1$ depending on the nesting depth and the problem
considered. When applying a single nesting level to a problem with constraints
of size 2 such as the graph coloring problem, this constant $\alpha$ is
estimated to be around 0.62 for average instances of maximum difficulty. This
corresponds to a square-root speedup over a classical nested search algorithm,
of which our presented algorithm is the quantum counterpart.

Zeno phase effect (QZPE) which says that under repeated measurements the
geometric phase of a quantum system can be inhibited. Since geometric phase
attributes a memory to a quatum system this result also proves that under
quantum Zeno dynamics the memory of a system can be erased. We have proposed a
