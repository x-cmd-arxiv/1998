luminosity for individual galaxies and apply it to the FIR background. We find
that these sources make up about half of the extragalactic radio background,
the other half being due to AGN. This is in agreement with other radio
observations, which leads us to conclude that the FIR-radio correlation holds
well for the very faint sources making up the FIR background, and that the FIR
background is indeed due to star-formation activity (not AGN or other possible
sources). If these star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index between
0.4 and 0.8, and make up 40 to 60% of the extragalactic radio background, we
find that they have redshifts between roughly 1 and 2, in agreement with recent
estimates by Madau et al. of the redshift of peak star-formation activity. We
compare the observed extragalactic radio background to the integral over the
logN-logS curve for star-forming radio sources, and find that the slope of the
curve must change significantly below about 1 microjansky. At 1 microjansky,
the faint radio source counts predict about 25 sources per square arcminute,

  type",,,,,"astro-ph",,"  The universality of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) contrasts
the variation seen in the specific frequency ($S_N$). The variation in $S_N$
has been shown to follow a linear relation with $L_X$ for brightest cluster
galaxies (Blakeslee, J. 1997, Harris, W.E. et al. 1998). Further, the variation
of $S_N$ with galactic radius within individual giant ellipticals is seen to be
a constant fraction of the gas density (McLaughlin 1998). There are now a
number of galaxies for which direct mass estimates based on the radial
velocities of the globular clusters are available. By comparing the mass of
galaxies determined in this way with the number of clusters within these
galaxies we show that the fraction of mass which is converted into globular
clusters is constant independent of galaxy type or environment. This implies
that the process of globular cluster formation is not influenced by the host
galaxy and supports the notion of the universal GCLF.

data (Lu et al. 1993), this paper completes our optical surface photometry
campaign on this galaxy sample. As an application of this data set, the B-band
photometry is used here to illustrate two selection effects which have been
somewhat overlooked in the literature, but which may be important in deriving
the distribution function of disk central surface brightness (CSB) of disk
galaxies from a diameter or/and flux limited sample: a Malmquist-type bias
against disk galaxies with small disk scale lengths (DSL) at a given CSB; and a
disk inclination dependent selection effect that may, for example, bias toward
inclined disks near the threshold of a diameter limited selection if disks are
not completely opaque in optical. Taking into consideration these selection
effects, we present a method of constructing a volume sampling function and a
way to interpret the derived distribution function of CSB and DSL. Application
of this method to our galaxy sample implies that if galaxy disks are optically
thin, CSB and DSL may well be correlated in the sense that, up to an
inclination-corrected limiting CSB of about 24.5 mag per square arcsec that is
adequately probed by our galaxy sample, the DSL distribution of galaxies with a
lower CSB may have a longer tail toward large values unless the distribution of
disk galaxies as a function of CSB rises rapidly toward faint values.

model with pair hopping interaction, i.e. the Penson-Kolb-Hubbard model are
studied. The analysis of the model is performed for d-dimensional hypercubic
lattices, including d=1 and d=$\infty$, by means of the (broken symmetry)
Hartree-Fock approximations and, for d=$\infty$, by the slave-boson mean-field
method. For d=1, at half-filling the phase diagram is shown to consist of nine
different phases including two superconducting states with center-of-mass
momentum q=0 and q=Q ($\eta$-pairing), site and bond-located antiferromagnetic
and charge-density wave states as well as three mixed phases with coexisting
site and bond orderings. The stability range of the bond-type orderings is
shrank with increasing lattice dimensionality d and for d=$\infty$ the
corresponding diagram consists of four phases only, involving exclusively
site-located orderings. Comparing the pair hopping model with the attractive
Hubbard model we found in the both cases gradual evolution from the BCS-like
limit to the tightly bound pairs regime and a monotonic increase of the gap in
the excitation spectrum with increasing coupling. However, the dynamics of
electron pairs in both models is qualitatively different, which results in
different dependences of condensation energies and critical temperatures on
interaction parameters as well as in different electrodynamic properties,
especially in a strong coupling regime.

gravitational interactions between the in-falling particles and Hawking
radiation, has been generalised to include transverse effects. The action
describing the collision turned out to be a string theory action with an
antisymmetric tensor background. In this article we show that the model
reproduces both the correct longitudinal and transverse dynamics, even when one
goes beyond the eikonal approximation or particles collide at nonvanishing
incidence angles. It also gives the correct momentum tranfer that takes place
in the process. Including a curvature on the horizon provides the action with
an extra term, which can be interpreted as a dilaton contribution. The
amplitude of the scattering is seen to reproduce the Veneziano amplitude in a
certain limit, as in earlier work by 't Hooft. The theory resembles a
""holographic"" field theory, in the sense that it only depends on the horizon
degrees of freedom, and the in- and out-Hilbert spaces are the same. The
operators representing the coordinates of in- and out-going particles are
non-commuting, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle must be corrected by a
term proportional to the ratio of the ingoing momentum to the impact parameter,
times Newton's constant. Reducing to 2+1 dimensions, we find that the

that the unification scale is too high to permit direct exploration. In this
paper, we show that the unification scale can be significantly lowered (perhaps

Such extra dimensions are a natural consequence of string theories with
large-radius compactifications. We show that extra spacetime dimensions
naturally lead to gauge coupling unification at intermediate mass scales, and
moreover may provide a natural mechanism for explaining the fermion mass
hierarchy by permitting the fermion masses to evolve with a power-law
dependence on the mass scale. We also show that proton-decay constraints may be
satisfied in our scenario due to the higher-dimensional cancellation of
proton-decay amplitudes to all orders in perturbation theory. Finally, we
extend these results by considering theories without supersymmetry;
experimental collider signatures; and embeddings into string theory. The latter
also enables us to develop several novel methods of explaining the fermion mass
hierarchy via $D$-branes. Our results therefore suggest a new approach towards
understanding the physics of grand unification as well as the phenomenology of

percent tensor asymmetry $A_2(x,Q^2) =b_2(x,Q^2)/F_{2D}(x,Q^2)$. We calculate
the shadowing of the gluon distribution in the deuteron for two different
pomeron gluon-distributions. For a hard gluon dominated $\Pom$-structure
function, as advocated by H1, we find large gluon shadowing, which appears to
be in conflict with the DGLAP analysis of nuclear SF's.

temperature. These are chiral anomaly and Chern--Simons term. It occurs that
the chiral anomaly doesn't depend on density and temperature. Chern-Simons term
appearance in even dimensions is studied under two types of constraints: chiral
and usual charges conservation. In odd dimensions, by using different methods
it is shown that $\mu^2 = m^2$ is the crucial point for Chern--Simons at zero
temperature. So when $\mu^2 < m^2$ $\mu$--influence disappears and we get the
usual Chern-Simons term. On the other hand, when $\mu^2 > m^2$ the Chern-Simons
term vanishes because of non--zero density of background fermions. The
connection between parity anomalous Chern-Simons in odd dimension and chiral
anomaly in even dimension is established at arbitrary density and temperature.
These results hold in any dimension as in abelian, so as in nonabelian cases.

string theory for the complete (1,1) sector of the theory by performing a
reduction, on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, of M-theory on S^1/Z_2. A crucial
ingredient for a consistent truncation is a non-zero mode of the antisymmetric
tensor field strength which arises due to magnetic sources on the orbifold
planes. The correct effective theory is a gauged version of five-dimensional
N=1 supergravity coupled to Abelian vector multiplets, the universal
hypermultiplet and four-dimensional boundary theories with gauge and gauge
matter fields. The gauging is such that the dual of the four-form field
strength in the universal multiplet is charged under a particular linear
combination of the Abelian vector fields. In addition, the theory has potential
terms for the moduli in the bulk as well as on the boundary. Because of these
potential terms, the supersymmetric ground state of the theory is a
multi-charged BPS three-brane domain wall, which we construct in general. We
show that the five-dimensional theory together with this solution provides the
correct starting point for particle phenomenology as well as early universe
cosmology. As an application, we compute the four-dimensional N=1 supergravity
theory for the complete (1,1) sector to leading nontrivial order by a reduction
on the domain wall background. We find a correction to the matter field Kahler
potential and threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic functions.
