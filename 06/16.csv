abundance an observable diagnostic of supernovae. Through use of a nuclear
reaction network, we have systematically varied reaction rates and groups of
reaction rates to experimentally identify those that govern Ti44 abundance in
core-collapse supernova nucleosynthesis. We survey the nuclear-rate dependence
by repeated calculations of the identical adiabatic expansion, with peak
temperature and density chosen to be 5.5xE9 K and 1E7 g/cc, respectively, to
approximate the conditions in detailed supernova models. We find that, for
equal total numbers of neutrons and protons (eta=0), Ti44 production is most
sensitive to the following reaction rates: Ti44(alpha,p)V47,
alpha(2alpha,gamma)C12, Ti44(alpha,gamma)Cr48, V45(p,gamma)Cr46. We tabulate
the most sensitive reactions in order of their importance to the Ti44
production near the standard values of currently accepted cross-sections, at
both reduced reaction rate (0.01X) and at increased reaction rate (100X)
relative to their standard values. Although most reactions retain their
importance for eta > 0, that of V45(p,gamma)Cr46 drops rapidly for eta >=
0.0004. Other reactions assume greater significance at greater neutron excess:
C12(alpha,gamma)O16, Ca40(alpha,gamma)Ti44, Al27(alpha,n)P30, Si30(alpha,n)S33.

component that cannot be observed at cosmological distances and a strongly
collimated and Doppler-boosted component that can only be seen if looking
nearly along the collimation axis. Such collimation requires a high rate of
occurrence perhaps consistent with a supernova rate. The collimated flow may be
generated by core collapse to produce rotating, magnetized neutron stars. All
core collapse events may produce such jets, but only the ones that occur in

Hii-regions (UCHii's). Our conclusion is that the high fraction of
``unresolved'' UCHii's from the catalogues of Wood & Churchwell (1989) and
Kurtz et al. (1994) cannot be explained by disks around massive stars. In
particular, the observed infrared spectra of these objects indicate dust
temperatures which are about one order of magnitude lower than expected. We
suggest that disks around close companions to OB stars may be necessary to
resolve this inconsistency. Alternatively, strong stellar winds and radiative
acceleration could remove disk material from the immediate vicinity of luminous
O stars, whereas for the lower luminosity sources considered here this will not
occur. We also find that line profiles tracing the evaporated material
originating from the disk are not influenced significantly by the existence of
stellar winds over a wide range of wind velocities (400 - 1000 km/s). We
compare our results to the bright IRAS source MWC349A. Many of its properties,
especially its spatial appearance in high-resolution radio maps, can be well
explained by a disk surrounding a UV luminous star with a high velocity stellar
wind.

wavelength-sensitive optical devices. A resonator is characterized by a set of
modes, each with a resonant frequency omega and resonance width Delta
omega=1/tau, where tau is the lifetime of a photon in the mode. In a
cylindrical or spherical dielectric resonator, extremely long-lived resonances
are due to `whispering gallery' modes in which light circulates around the
perimeter trapped by total internal reflection. These resonators emit light
isotropically. Recently, a new category of asymmetric resonant cavities (ARCs)
has been proposed in which substantial shape deformation leads to partially
chaotic ray dynamics. This has been predicted to give rise to a universal,
frequency-independent broadening of the whispering-gallery resonances, and
highly anisotropic emission. Here we present solutions of the wave equation for
ARCs which confirm many aspects of the earlier ray-optics model, but also
reveal interesting frequency-dependent effects characteristic of quantum chaos.
For small deformations the lifetime is controlled by evanescent leakage, the
optical analogue of quantum tunneling. We find that the lifetime is much
shortened by a process known as `chaos-assisted tunneling'. In contrast, for
large deformations (~10%) some resonances are found to have longer lifetimes
than predicted by the ray chaos model due to `dynamical localization'.

  Theoretical AI (JETAI) special issue on memory-based learning",,,,"cmp-lg cs.CL",,"  Recognizing shallow linguistic patterns, such as basic syntactic
relationships between words, is a common task in applied natural language and
text processing. The common practice for approaching this task is by tedious
manual definition of possible pattern structures, often in the form of regular
expressions or finite automata. This paper presents a novel memory-based
learning method that recognizes shallow patterns in new text based on a
bracketed training corpus. The training data are stored as-is, in efficient
suffix-tree data structures. Generalization is performed on-line at recognition
time by comparing subsequences of the new text to positive and negative
evidence in the corpus. This way, no information in the training is lost, as
can happen in other learning systems that construct a single generalized model
at the time of training. The paper presents experimental results for
recognizing noun phrase, subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English.
Since the learning approach enables easy porting to new domains, we plan to
apply it to syntactic patterns in other languages and to sub-language patterns
for information extraction.

be ``protein-like'', heteropolymers must be thermodynamically stable, stable

criteria which, together, guarantee that a sequence will be ``protein like'':
i) the ground state is a highly designable stucture, i. e. the native structure
is the ground state of a large number of sequences, and ii) the sequence has a
large $\Delta/\Gamma$ ratio, $\Delta$ being the average energy separation
between the ground state and the excited compact conformations, and $\Gamma$
the dispersion in energy of excited compact conformations. These two criteria
are not incompatible since, on average, sequences whose ground states are
highly designable structures have large $\Delta/\Gamma$ values. These two
criteria require knowledge only of the compact-state spectrum. These claims are
substantiated by the study of 45 sequences, with various values of
$\Delta/\Gamma$ and various degrees of designability, by means of a
Borst-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, and the Ferrenberg-Swendsen histogram
optimization method. Finally, we report on the reasons for slow folding. A
comparison between a very slow folding sequence, an average folding one and a
fast folding one suggests that slow folding originates from a proliferation of
nearly compact low-energy conformations, not present for fast folders.

CMS concerning the discovery potential for squarks and gluinos, sleptons,
charginos and neutralinos, SUSY dark matter, lightest Higgs, sparticle mass
determination methods and the detector design optimisation in view of SUSY
searches. It represents the status of our understanding of these subjects as of
Summer 1997.
  As a benchmark model we used the minimal supergravity-inspired super-
symmetric standard model (mSUGRA) with a stable LSP. Discovery of SUSY at the
LHC should be relatively straightforward. It may occur through the observation
of a large excesses of events in missing E_T + jets, or with one or more
isolated leptons. An excess of trilepton events or of isolated dileptons with
E_T^miss, exhibiting a characteristic signature in the l^+l^- invariant mass
distribution could also be the first manifestation of SUSY production. Squark
and gluino production may represent a copious source of Higgs bosons through
cascade decays. The lightest SUSY Higgs h->bbbar may be reconstructed with a
signal/background ratio of order 1. The lightest supersymmetric particle of
SUSY models with conserved R-parity represents a very good candidate for the
cosmological dark matter. The region of parameter space where this is true is
well-covered by our searches, at least for tan(beta)=2.
  If supersymmetry exists at electroweak scale it could hardly escape detection
in CMS, and the study of supersymmetry will form a central part of our physics
program.

solution for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, with eigenvalues given by zeroes
of a certain well-computable function $r(p)$, which signify that the two
solutions with desired behaviour at two singular points become linearly
dependent. Our computation shows corrections to the WKB formula $m^2= 6n(n+1)$
for eigenvalues corresponding to glueball masses QCD-3, and gives the first
states with masses $m^2=$ 11.58766; 34.52698; 68.974962; 114.91044; 172.33171;
241.236607; 321.626549, ... . In $QCD_4$, our computation gives squares of
masses 37.169908; 81.354363; 138.473573; 208.859215; 292.583628; 389.671368;
500.132850; 623.97315 ... for $O++$. In both cases, we have a powerful method
which allows to compute eigenvalues with an arbitrary precision, if needed so,
which may provide quantative tests for the duality conjecture. Our results
matches with the numerical computation of [5] well withing precision reported
there in both $QCD_3$ and $QCD_4$ cases. As an additional curiosity, we report
that for eigenvalues of about 7000, the power series, although convergent, has
coefficients of orders ${10}^{34}$; tricks we used to get reliably the function
$r(p)$, as also the final answer gets small, of order ${10}^{-6}$ in $QCD_4$.
In principle we can go to infinitely high eigenavalues, but such computations
maybe impractical due to corrections.

coupled to vector and tensor multiplets. In particular, we show that, while the

non-vanishing. In addition, we show how to revert to a supersymmetric
formulation in terms of covariant non-integrable field equations that embody
corresponding covariant anomalies.

background Q of multiplicity N. The worldvolume of each M-5-brane is supposed
to be given by the local product of the four-dimensional spacetime and an
elliptic curve. In the coincidence limit, all these curves yield a single
(Seiberg-Witten) hyperelliptic curve, while the gauge symmetry is enhanced to
U(N). We make this gauge symmetry enhancement manifest by considering the
hypermultiplet LEEA which is given by the spacetime N=2 non-linear sigma-model
(NLSM) having Q as the target space. The hyper-K""ahler manifold Q is given by
the multicentre Taub-NUT space, which in the coincidence limit amounts to the
multiple Eguchi-Hanson (ALE) space Q. The NLSM is most naturally described in
terms of the hyper-K""ahler coset construction on SU(N,N)/U(N) in harmonic
superspace, by using the auxiliary (in classical theory) N=2 vector superfields
as Lagrange multipliers, with FI terms resolving the singularity. The Maldacena
limit, in which the hypermultiplet LEEA becomes extended to the N=4 SYM with
the gauge group U(N), arises in quantum field theory due to a dynamical
generation of the N=2 vector and hypermultipet superfields, when sending the FI
terms to zero.

dimensions for weak disorder and large energy barriers. We map the random
continuous spin distributions to distributions for an Ising-spin system by
means of a single-site coarse-graining method described by local transition
kernels. We derive a contour- representation for them with notably positive
contour activities and prove their Gibbsianness. This representation is shown
to allow for application of the discrete-spin renormalization group developed
by Bricmont/Kupiainen implying the result in $d\geq 3$.

the O(N) model are derived in the presence of a heat bath, in both the
symmetric phase as well as the phase of spontaneously broken symmetry. The heat
bath leads to dissipation and fluctuation terms in the classical equations of
motion, which are explicitly computed to lowest order in perturbation theory.
In the broken phase these terms are found to be large for the sigma field, even
at zero temperature, due to the decay process sigma -> pi pi, while they are
small for the pi fields at temperatures below T_c = 160 MeV. It is shown that
in large volumes the presence of dissipation and fluctuations suppresses the
formation of disoriented chiral condensates (DCC's). In small volumes, however,
fluctuations become sufficiently large to induce the formation of DCC's even if
chiral symmetry has not been restored in the initial stage of the system's
evolution.
