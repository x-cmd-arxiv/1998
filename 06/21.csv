mass distribution of a cluster from weak lensing provided that both the
geometry of the universe and the probability distribution of galaxy redshifts
are known; actually, when additional photometric data are taken to be
available, the galaxy redshift distribution could be determined jointly with
the cluster mass from the weak lensing analysis. In this paper we develop, in
the spirit of a ``thought experiment,'' a method to constrain the geometry of
the universe from weak lensing, provided that the redshifts of the source
galaxies are measured. The quantitative limits and merits of the method are
discussed analytically and with a set of simulations, in relation to point
estimation, interval estimation, and test of hypotheses for homogeneous
Friedmann-Lemaitre models. The constraints turn out to be significant when a
few thousand source galaxies are used.

the propagation of nucleons above 10**(19) eV in the Local Supercluster,
assuming that the ambient magnetic field is turbulent, and its strength 0.01 <
B_rms < 1 micro-Gauss. In such strong magnetic fields, protons in the low
energy part of the spectrum, 10**(19) eV < E < E_C diffuse, while the higher
energy particles, with E > E_C propagate along nearly straight lines. The
magnitude of the transition energy E_C depends mainly on the strength of the
magnetic field, the coherence length, and the distance to the source; for
B_rms=0.1 micro-Gauss, a largest eddy of length 10 Mpc, and a distance to the
source of 10 Mpc, E_C=100 EeV. Our numerical treatment substantially improves
on previous analytical approximations, as it allows to treat carefully the
transition between the two propagation regimes, as well as the effects due to
inhomogeneities expected on scales of a few Mpc. We show that a turbulent
magnetic field B_rms=0.1 micro-Gauss, close to equipartition, would allow to
reproduce exactly the observed spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays, up to
the highest energy observed, for a distance to the source below 10 Mpc, for the
geometry of the Local Supercluster, i.e. a sheet of thickness 10 Mpc.
Diffusion, in this case, allows to reproduce the high flux beyond the Greisen
Zatsepin Kuzmin cut-off, with a soft injection spectrum proportional to
E**(-2.4). Moreover, the large deflection angles at the highest energies
observed, typically 10 degrees for the above values, would explain why no
close-by astrophysical counterpart could be associated with these events.

with a velocity gradient along them which suggests that the masers are situated
in edge-on circumstellar, or protoplanetary, disks. We present VLBI
observations of the methanol maser source G309.92+0.48, in the 12.2 GHz
transition, which confirm previous observations that the masers in this source
lie along a line. We show that such sources are not only linear in space but,
in many cases, also have a linear velocity gradient. We then model these and
other data in both the 6.7 GHz and the 12.2 GHz transition from a number of
star formation regions, and show that the observed spatial and velocity
distribution of methanol masers, and the derived Keplerian masses, are
consistent with a circumstellar disk rotating around an OB star. We consider
this and other hypotheses, and conclude that about half of these methanol
masers are probably located in edge-on circumstellar disks around young stars.
This is of particular significance for studies of circumstellar disks because
of the detailed velocity information available from the masers.

the Gauss-Bonnet term, the cosmological solutions for an empty universe and a

employing analytical and numerical methods, we show that, in the presence of

shown to be confined in a part of the phase space of the theory allowing the

invariant quantity. Correspondingly, reference frame dependence and gauge
dependence are inherited to most of the elements of the usual formulation of
quantum mechanics (including operators, states and events). If a frame
dependent and gauge dependent formalism is called, in short, a relative
formalism, then the aim of the paper is to establish an absolute, i.e., frame
and gauge free, reformulation of quantum mechanics. To fulfil this aim, we
develop absolute quantities and the corresponding equations instead of the wave
function and the Schr\""odinger equation. The absolute quantities have a more
direct physical interpretation than the wave function has, and the
corresponding equations express explicitly the independent physical aspects of
the system which are contained in the Schr\""odinger equation in a mixed and
more hidden form. Based on the absolute quantities and equations, events,
states and physical quantities are introduced also in an absolute way. The
formalism makes it possible to obtain some sharper versions of the uncertainty
relation and to extend the validity of Ehrenfest's theorem. The absolute
formulation allows wide extensions of quantum mechanics. To give examples, we
discuss two known nonlinear extensions and, in close detail, a dissipative
system. An argument is provided that the absolute formalism may lead to an
explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect purely in terms of the electromagnetic
field strength tensor. At last, on special relativistic and curved spacetimes,
absolute quantities and equations instead of the Klein-Gordon wave function and
equation are given, and their nonrelativistic limit is derived.
