radio-loud quasars (RLQs) at redshifts z=0.6-2. In this paper we discuss the
sample selection and observations for the z=1-2 subsample and the reduction and
cataloguing techniques used. We discuss technical issues at some length, since
few detailed descriptions of near-IR data reduction and multicolor object
cataloguing are currently available in single literature references.
  Our sample of 33 RLQs contains comparable numbers of flat- and steep- radio
spectrum sources and sources of various radio morphologies, and spans a similar
range of absolute magnitude and radio power, allowing us to disentangle
dependence of environment on such properties from redshift evolution.
  We use the standard ``shift-and-stare'' method of creating deep mosaiced
images where the exposure time (and thus the RMS noise) at each pixel is not
constant across the mosaic. An unusual feature of our reduction procedure is
the creation of images with constant RMS noise from such mosaics. We adopted
this procedure to enable use of the FOCAS detection package over almost the
entire mosaic instead of only in the area of deepest observation where the RMS
noise is constant, thereby roughly doubling our areal coverage.
  We correct the object counts in our fields for stellar contamination using
the SKY model of Cohen (1995) and compare the galaxy counts to those in random
fields. Even after accounting for possible systematic magnitude offsets we find
a significant excess of K>=19 galaxies. Analysis and discussion of this excess
population is presented by Hall & Green (1998).

the galaxies with L_ir > 10^{12.3} L_sun present Seyfert characteristics. Many
of the optical properties of these Seyfert galaxies are consistent with the
presence of a genuine active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the core of these
objects.
  The continuum colors and strengths of the stellar H-beta and MgIb features in
and out of the nuclei of ULIGs indicate that star formation has recently (~10^7
yr) taken place in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of many of these
objects. As expected, photoionization by hot stars appears to be the dominant
source of ionization in the objects with H II region-like spectra. Evidence is
presented that the ionization source in infrared-selected galaxies with nuclear
LINER-like spectra (38% of the ULIGs in our sample) is likely to be shocks or
of stellar origins rather than an AGN. Shock ionization associated with
starburst-driven outflows may also explain the LINER-like emission detected

the galaxy surface density at >40'' in the same fields, and a component roughly
uniform to ~100'' significant compared to the galaxy surface density seen in
random-field surveys in the literature. The r-K color distributions of the
excess galaxy populations are indistinguishable and are significantly redder

  The excess galaxies are consistent with being predominantly early-type

associated with intervening MgII absorption systems. The average excess within
0.5 Mpc (~65'') of the quasars corresponds to Abell richness class ~0 compared
to the galaxy surface density at >0.5 Mpc from the quasars, and to Abell
richness class ~1.5 compared to that from the literature.
  We discuss the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in fields

consistent with being 2-3 Gyr old early-types at the quasar redshifts of z~1.5.
However, some objects have SEDs consistent with being 4-5 Gyr old at z~1.5, and
a number of others are consistent with ~2 Gyr old but dust-reddened galaxies at
the quasar redshifts. These potentially different galaxy types suggest there
may be considerable dispersion in the properties of early-type cluster galaxies

(SNR) has strengthened the evidence that cosmic ray electrons are accelerated
in SNR. We show, that if this is indeed the case, the local electron spectrum
will be strongly time-dependent, at least above roughly 30 GeV. The time
dependence stems from the Poisson fluctuations in the number of SNR within a
certain volume and within a certain time interval. As far as cosmic ray
electrons are concerned, the Galaxy looks like actively bubbling swiss cheese
rather than a steady, homogeneously filled system. Our finding has important
consequences for studies of the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission, for which
a strong excess over model predictions above 1 GeV has been reported recently.
While these models were relying on an electron injection spectrum with index
2.4 -- chosen to fit the local electron flux up to 1 TeV -- we show that an
electron injection index of around 2.0 would a) be consistent with the expected
Poisson fluctuations in the locally observable electron spectrum and b) explain
the above mentioned gamma-ray excess above 1 GeV. An electron injection index
around 2 would also correspond to the average radio synchrotron spectrum of
individual SNR. We use a three-dimensional propagation code to calculate the
spectra of electrons throughout the Galaxy and show that the longitude and
latitude distribution of the leptonic gamma-ray production above 1 GeV is in
accord with the respective distributions for the gamma-ray excess. We finally
point out that our model implies a strong systematic uncertainty in the
determination of the spectrum of the extragalactic gamma-ray background.

gravitational N-body systems, we study the exponential instability in their
trajectories. It is found that the exponentiation time-scale for isotropic
Plummer spheres varies very little with particle number if the softening is
small. Large softening on the other hand has a marked effect and, if large
enough, can cause the curvatures to become positive. This last result confirms
the previous observations for self gravitating sheets and suggests that the
qualitative behaviour of large-N and continuum systems may be different, and
that their equivalence is only obtained in the limit of infinite $N$ and finite
softening. It is also found that the presence of a large fraction of the
kinetic energy in rotational motion increases the exponentiation time-scales
significantly --- an effect that should be expected given the regular nature of
nearly circular motion. In the light of the results of this and of previous
studies, it is suggested that the exponential instability may arise from low
order resonances between the period of the variation of the gravitational field
due to distant encounters and the orbital period of a test particle. For
periods long compared to the exponentiation time but short compared to the
diffusion time-scales of the action variables, the standard picture of
collisionless dynamics may be valid in an averaged sense. Instead it is
suggested that, at least for systems with well defined final states, the
relaxation time should scale as $\sim N^{1/2}$.

20000 km/s$) in order to model the influence on $m_n$ of cluster richness. This
luminosity function is found to be universal and the fit of a Schechter profile
gives $\alpha = -1.50 \pm 0.11$ and $M_{bj}* = -19.91 \pm 0.21$ in the range
[-21,-17]. The uncorrected distance indicator $m_n$ is more efficient for the
first ranks n. With n=5, we have a dispersion of 0.61 magnitude for the
(m$_n$,5log(cz)) relation. When we correct for the richness effect and subtract
the background galaxies we reduce the uncertainty to 0.21 magnitude with n=15.
Simulations show that a large part of this dispersion originates from the
intrinsic scatter of the standard candle itself. These provide upper bounds on
the amplitude $\sigma_v$ of cluster radial peculiar motions. At a confidence
level of 90%, the dispersion is 0.13 magnitude and $\sigma_v$ is limited to
1200 km/s for our sample of clusters.

spectral function of the probe. In particular, there is an orthogonality
catastrophe when the filling factor is an even-denominator filling fraction due
to the compressibility of the state, but there is no catastrophe at
odd-denominator filling factors because these states have a gap to excitations.
The catastrophe is found to be more severe for composite fermions in zero

function of the poset. A key tool is provided by a new labeling of the maximal
chains of a poset of shuffles, which is also used to give bijective proofs of
enumerative properties originally obtained by Greene. In addition we define a
monoid of multiplicative functions on all posets of shuffles and describe this
monoid in terms of a new operation on power series in two variables.

gas-dynamic filter - a device for cleaning gas from solid particles with
counter flow of large water particles in order to prevent their release to the
atmosphere.
  Ideal and viscous gas flows are considered. It is assumed, that gas flow is
stationary, incompressible and plane, thus in the case of ideal gas stream
function is considered, and in its terms boundary conditions are formulated. To
determine stream function Dirichlet problem for Laplace equation is solved.
Numerical solution is obtained using five-point scheme, and analytical - by
conformal mapping. It is demonstrated that numerical solution fits very
accurately with the analytical one. Then in the already known gas flow field
trajectories of particles of different size are calculated in Lagrange
formulation, taking into account dust particles as well as filtering water
drops.
  Trajectories of particles of several different sizes under different modes of
filter operation were analysed. The adequacy of real and computed flow is
demonstrated.
  Computation of the flow is done using full Navier-Stokes equations. The
possibility of formation of rotation and separation zones in the flow is
demonstrated.
