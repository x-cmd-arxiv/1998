Gamma-Ray Burst remnants. This method leads to numerical calculations of
fireball dynamics that are computationally faster than hydrodynamic
simulations. It is also a very flexible approach, that can be easily extended
to include more complex situations, such as a continuous injection of energy at
the reverse shock, and the sideways expansion in non-spherical ejecta.
  Some features of the numerical results for the remnant dynamical evolution
are discussed and compared to the analytical results. We find that the ratio of
the observer times when the jet half-angle reaches twice its initial value and
when the light cone becomes wider than the jet is substantially smaller than
predicted analytically. The effects arising from the remnant curvature and
thickness further reduce this ratio, such that the afterglow light-curve break
due to the remnant finite angular extent overlaps the weaker break due to the
jet's sideways expansion.
  An analysis of the effects of the curvature and thickness of the remnant on
the afterglow light-curves shows that these effects are important and should be
taken into account for accurate calculations of the afterglow emission.

colour-magnitude diagrams that reach to an apparent magnitude in V of ~25, well
below the main sequence turnoff. These particular clusters are involved with
significantly high LMC field star densities and care was taken to subtract the
field stars from the cluster colour-magnitude diagrams accurately. In two cases
there is significant variable reddening across at least part of the image, but
only for NGC 1916 does the differential reddening preclude accurate
measurements of the CMD characteristics. The morphologies of the colour-
magnitude diagrams match well those of Galactic globular clusters of similar
metallicity. All six have well-developed horizontal branches, while four
clearly have stars on both sides of the RR Lyrae gap. The abundances obtained
from measurements of the height of the red giant branch above the level of the
horizontal branch are 0.3 dex higher, on average, than previously measured
spectroscopic abundances. Detailed comparisons with Galactic globular cluster
fiducials show that all six clusters are old objects, very similar in age to
classical Galactic globulars such as M5, with little age spread among the
clusters. This result is consistent with ages derived by measuring the
magnitude difference between the horizontal branch and main sequence turnoff.
We also find a similar chronology by comparing the horizontal branch
morphologies and abundances with the horizontal branch evolutionary tracks of
Lee, Demarque, & Zinn (1994). Our results imply that the LMC formed at the same

distribution of galaxies is one of the major goals of modern cosmology.
However, if galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution,
linear perturbation theory leads to a degeneracy between $\Omega_0$ and the
linear bias parameter $b$, and the density parameter cannot be estimated. In
Matarrese, Verde & Heavens (1997) we developed a method based on second-order
perturbation theory to use the bispectrum to lift this degeneracy by measuring
the bias parameter in an $\Omega_0$-independent way. The formalism was
developed assuming that one has perfect information on the positions of
galaxies in three dimensions. In galaxy redshift surveys, the three-dimensional
information is imperfect, because of the contaminating effects of peculiar
velocities, and the resulting clustering pattern in redshift space is
distorted. In this paper, we combine second-order perturbation theory with a
model for collapsed, virialised structures, to extend the method to redshift
space, and demonstrate that the method should be successful in determining with
reasonable accuracy the bias parameter from state-of-the-art surveys such as
the Anglo-Australian 2 degree field survey and the Sloan digital sky survey.

galaxies of the Gonzalez's (1993) sample, most of which locates in small
groups, based on the colour dispersion around the U-V versus central velocity
dispersion relation, and the equivalent width of Hbeta absorption. There are
significant number of Hbeta strong galaxies which have EW(Hbeta)>2A, however
they do not always have bluer colours in U-V. To be consistent with small
colour dispersion of U-V, the mass fraction of secondary burst to the total
mass should be less than only 10% at the maximum within recent 2Gyr. This
result suggests that even if recent galaxy merging produce some ellipticals, it
should not have been accompanied by an intensive star burst, and hence it could
not involve large gas-rich systems. A capture of dwarf galaxy is more likely to
explain dynamical disturbances observed in some elliptical galaxies.
  The above analysis based on the U-V is not compatible with the one based on
the line indices, which requires that more than 10% of mass is present in a
2Gyr old star burst to cover the full range of the observed Hbeta (de Jong &
Davies 1997). The discrepancy might be partly explained by the internal
extinction localized at the region where young stars form. However, considering
that the Hbeta index might have great uncertainties both in models and in
observational data, we basically rely on U-V analysis.

close to 18sec (equivalent to 4800 cycles/day) but they are separated by
57.7+/-0.5 cycles/day. The lower frequency component of the pair has a strong
second harmonic while its companion, which has about twice its amplitude, does

of a passive scalar quantity advected by the Gaussian non-solenoidal
(``compressible'') velocity field with the covariance $\propto\delta(t-t')|
x-x'|^{\epsilon}$. Convective range anomalous scaling for the structure
functions and various pair correlators is established, and the corresponding
anomalous exponents are calculated to the order $\epsilon^2$ of the $\epsilon$
expansion. These exponents are non-universal, as a result of the degeneracy of
the RG fixed point. In contrast to the case of a purely solenoidal velocity
field (Obukhov--Kraichnan model), the correlation functions in the case at hand
exhibit nontrivial dependence on both the IR and UV characteristic scales, and
the anomalous scaling appears already at the level of the pair correlator. The
powers of the scalar field without derivatives, whose critical dimensions
determine the anomalous exponents, exhibit multifractal behaviour. The exact
solution for the pair correlator is obtained; it is in agreement with the
result obtained within the $\epsilon$ expansion. The anomalous exponents for
passively advected magnetic fields are also presented in the first order of the
$\epsilon$ expansion.

It can also serve as a model for vortex lines in superconductors with a

analogy between the vortex lines and the statistical mechanics of quantum

analogy yields a non-Hermitian boson Hubbard model. At integer filling, we find
that for small transverse fields, the insulating phase is preserved, and the
transverse field is exponentially screened away from the boundaries of the
superconductor. At larger transverse fields, a ``superfluid'' phase of tilted,
entangled vortices appears. The universality class of the transition is found
to be that of vortex lines entering the Meissner phase at H_{c1}, with the

on the light-front in this description. We also present a novel analysis of the
power corrections based on light-front power counting which resolves some

Further, the factorization theorem and the scale evolution of the structure

time-ordered perturbation theory with multi-parton wave functions.
Nonperturbative QCD dynamics underlying the structure functions can be explored

violations due to perturbative QCD corrections can be rather easily addressed
in this framework by simply replacing the hadron target by dressed parton
target and then carrying out a systematic expansion in the coupling constant
$\alpha_s$ based on the perturbative QCD expansion of the dressed parton
target. The tools employed for this calculation are those available from
light-front old-fashioned perturbation theory. We present the complete set of
calculations of unpolarized and polarized deep inelastic structure functions to
order $\alpha_s$. We extract the relevant splitting functions in all the cases.
We explicitly verify all the sum rules to order $\alpha_s$. We demonstrate the

later context, a technique is developed that solders the dual aspects of some
symmetry following from the bosonisation of two distinct fermionic models,
leading to new results which cannot be otherwise obtained. Exploiting this
technique, the two dimensional chiral determinants with opposite chirality are
soldered to reproduce either the usual gauge invariant expression leading to

detailed cascade calculation that different annihilation cross--sections of

arbitrary $N$-dimensional density matrix $\rho$ into a sum of seperable density
matrices with dimensions given by the coprime factors of $N$ is introduced. For
a class of density matrices a complete tensor product factorization is
achieved. The construction is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem and the
projective unitary representation of $Z_N$ by the discrete Heisenberg group
$H_N$. The pd isomorphism is unitarily implemented and it is shown to be
coassociative and to act on $H_N$ as comultiplication. Density matrices with
complete pd are interpreted as grouplike elements of $H_N$. To quantify the
distance of $\rho$ from its pd a trace-norm correlation index $\cal E$ is
introduced and its invariance groups are determined.
