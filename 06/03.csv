the yields and lifetimes of the stellar progenitors, the chemical evolution of
galaxies serves as one of the key tools that allows the tracing of galaxy
evolution. In order to deduce the evolution of separate galactic regions one
has to account for the dynamics of the interstellar medium, because distant
regions can interact by means of large-scale dynamics. To be able to interpret
the distributions and ratios of the characteristic elements and their relation
to e.g. the galactic gas content, an understanding of the dynamical effects
combined with small-scale transitions between the gas phases by evaporation and
condensation is essential. In this paper, we address various complex signatures
of chemical evolution and present in particular two problems of abundance
distributions in different types of galaxies: the discrepancies of metallicity
distributions and effective yields in the different regions of our Milky Way
and the N/O abundance ratio in dwarf galaxies. These can be solved properly, if
the chemodynamical prescription is applied to simulations of galaxy evolution.

produced a superbubble whose affects on the low-density ambient interstellar

two striking blobs of X-ray emission embedded in \Ha loops which can be

result of the stopping of the continuous neutron vortex current through the

equivalent width of the line during the deep minimum was required to be

stable central frequencies at 300 Hz, 9 Hz, and 0.1 Hz, and a fourth that
varied over the range 14-28 Hz. The 300 Hz and 0.1 Hz QPOs appear only at the
highest observed luminosities (Lx > 0.15 Ledd), where the power-law component
dominates the X-ray spectrum. At lower luminosity, the disk flux exceeds the
power-law flux and only two of the QPOs are observed: the spectrally ""soft"" 9
Hz QPO, and the narrow, ""hard"" QPO that varies from 14-28 Hz as the hard flux
decreases. The 300 Hz QPO is likely to be analogous to the stationary QPO at 67
Hz seen in the microquasar GRS1915+105. We discuss models of these
high-frequency QPOs which depend on effects due to general relativity. The 9 Hz
QPO displays a spectrum consistent with a thermal origin, but this frequency
does not appear to be consistent with any of the natural time scales associated
with the disk, or with the inferred values of the mass and rapid spin of the

signatures of self-organized criticality A recently developed cell dynamical
system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed self-organized
criticality as intrinsic to quantumlike mechanics governing flow dynamics. The
model predicts the following: (a) The flow structure consists of an overall
logarithmic spiral trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for
the internal structure. (b) The universal algorithm for self-organized
criticality is expressed in terms of the universal Feigenbaum's constants. (c)
The Feigenbaum's constants are expressed as functions of the golden mean. (d)
The quantum mechanical constants ' fine structure constant' and 'ratio of
proton mass to electron mass' which are pure numbers and obtained by
experimental observations only, are now derived in terms of the Feigenbaum's
constant a. (e) Atmospheric flow structure follows Kepler's third law of
planetary motion. Therefore Newton's inverse square law for gravitation applies
to eddy masses also. The centripetal acceleration representing inertial masses
(of eddies) are equivalent to gravitational masses. Fractal structure to the
space-time continuum can be visualized as a nested continuum of vortex (eddy)
circulations whose inertial masses obey Newton's inverse square law of
gravitation. The model concepts are equivalent to a superstring model for
subatomic dynamics which incorporates gravitational forces.

Rayleigh-Ritz approximation for the effective action of nonlinear dynamical
systems started from random initial conditions. The present paper discusses
only the case where the PDF-Ansatz employed in the variational calculation is
``Markovian'', i.e. is determined completely by the present values of the
moment-averages. In this case we show that the Rayleigh-Ritz effective action
of the complete set of moment-functions that are employed in the closure has a
quadratic part which is always formally an Onsager-Machlup action. Thus,
subject to satisfaction of the requisite realizability conditions on the noise
covariance, a linear Langevin model will exist which reproduces exactly the
joint 2-time correlations of the moment-functions. We compare our method with
the closely related formalism of principal oscillation patterns (POP), which,
in the approach of C. Penland, is a method to derive such a linear Langevin
model empirically from time-series data for the moment-functions. The
predictive capability of the POP analysis, compared with the Rayleigh-Ritz
result, is limited to the regime of small fluctuations around the most probable
future pattern. Finally, we shall discuss a thermodynamics of statistical
moments which should hold for all dynamical systems with stable invariant
probability measures and which follows within the Rayleigh-Ritz formalism.

focus is to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with
different approximations to the relaxational dynamics: Boltzmann, non-Markovian
and Markovian quantum kinetics. The time evolution of the distribution function
is evaluated exactly using two methods: time evolution of an initially prepared
density matrix and by solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. There are two
different cases that are studied in detail: i) no stable particle states below
threshold of the bath and a quasiparticle resonance above it and ii) a stable
discrete exact `particle' state below threshold. For the case of quasiparticles
in the continuum (resonances) the exact quasiparticle distribution
asymptotically tends to a statistical equilibrium distribution that differs
from a simple Bose-Einstein form as a result of off-shell processes. In the
case ii), the distribution of particles does not thermalize with the bath. We
study the kinetics of thermalization and relaxation by deriving a non-Markovian
quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes
off-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell
contributions and the usual Boltzmann equation are obtained from the quantum
kinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different
coarse-graining assumptions. The relaxational dynamics predicted by the
non-Markovian, Markovian and Boltzmann approximations are compared to the exact
result of the model. The Boltzmann approach is seen to fail in the case of wide
resonances and when threshold and renormalization effects are important.

strength normal to the horizon goes to zero. Thus, extremal black holes are
found to exhibit the sort of `Meissner effect' which is characteristic of
superconducting media. We review some of the evidence for this effect, and do
present new evidence for it using recently found black hole solutions in string
theory and Kaluza-Klein theory. We also present some new solutions, which arise
naturally in string theory, which are non-superconducting extremal black holes.

looking carefully at the higher dimensional configurations from which the lower
dimensional black hole solutions are obtained. We show that other extremal
solitonic objects in string theory (such as p-branes) can also display
superconducting properties. In particular, we argue that the relativistic
London equation will hold on the worldvolume of `light' superconducting
p-branes (which are embedded in flat space), and that minimally coupled zero

theory in three and four dimensions, based on a conjectured duality between
supergravity and large N gauge theories. The glueball masses are obtained by
solving supergravity wave equations in a black hole geometry. We find that the
mass ratios are in good numerical agreement with the available lattice data. We
also compute the leading (g_{YM}^2 N)^{-1} corrections to the glueball masses,
by taking into account stringy corrections to the supergravity action and to
the black hole metric. We find that the corrections to the masses are negative
and of order (g_{YM}^2N)^{-3/2}. Thus for a fixed ultraviolet cutoff the masses
decrease as we decrease the 't Hooft coupling, in accordance with our
expectation about the continuum limit of the gauge theories.

the strongly coupled heterotic string. At energies below the grand-unified
scale, the effective theory is five- not four-dimensional, where the additional
coordinate parameterizes a S^1/Z_2 orbifold. Furthermore, it admits no
homogeneous solutions. Rather, the vacuum state, appropriate for a reduction to
four-dimensional supersymmetric models, is a BPS domain wall. Relevant
cosmological solutions are those associated with this BPS state. In particular,
such solutions must be inhomogeneous, depending on the orbifold coordinate as
well as on time. We present two examples of this new type of cosmological
solution, obtained by separation of variables rather that by exchange of time
and radius coordinate applied to a brane solution, as in previous work. The
first example represents the analog of a rolling radii solution with the radii
specifying the geometry of the domain wall. This is generalized in the second
example to include a nontrivial ``Ramond-Ramond'' scalar.

character with respect to the paramodular group \Gamma_3. It has several
interesting properties. One is that it admits an infinite product

discussed within three distinct macroscopic models (i.e. generalized RHTA,
geometrical overlap model and three-fluid hydrodynamics). We find that within
these models \sim 80% or more of the experimentally observed final-state
entropy is created in the early stage. It is thus likely followed by a nearly
isentropic expansion. We employ an equation of state with a first-order phase
transition. For low net baryon density, the entropy density exhibits a jump at
the phase boundary. However, the excitation function of the specific entropy
per net baryon, S/A, does not reflect this jump. This is due to the fact that
for final states (of the compression) in the mixed phase, the baryon density
\rho_B increases with \sqrt{s}, but not the temperature T. Calculations within
the three-fluid model show that a large fraction of the entropy is produced by
nuclear shockwaves in the projectile and target. With increasing beam energy,
this fraction of S/A decreases. At \sqrt{s}=20 AGeV it is on the order of the
entropy of the newly produced particles around midrapidity. Hadron ratios are
calculated for the entropy values produced initially at beam energies from 2 to
200 AGeV.

The form of the gluon propagator at low momenta is modeled by a 2-parameter
ansatz fitting the weak pion decay constant. The quarks are confined in the
sense that the quark propagator does not have a pole at timelike momenta. We
determine the ground state mass in the vector channel from the Euclidean time
Fourier transform of the correlator, which has an exponential falloff at large
times. The ground state mass lies around 590 MeV and is almost independent of
the model form for the gluon propagator. This method allows us to stay in
Euclidean space and to avoid analytic continuation of the quark or gluon
propagators into the timelike region.
