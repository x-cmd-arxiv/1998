the star where neutrinos are nearly in thermal equilibrium. Consequently,
parity violation in neutrino absorption and scattering can only give rise to
asymmetric neutrino flux above the neutrino-matter decoupling layer. The kick
velocity is substantially reduced from previous estimates, requiring a dipole

quasistellar objects (QSOs) provide a highly sensitive probe of the
distribution of gaseous matter in the universe. Over the past two decades
optical spectroscopy with large ground-based telescopes, and more recently
ultraviolet spectroscopy from space have yielded a wealth of information on
what appears to be a gaseous, photoionized intergalactic medium, partly
enriched by the products of stellar nucleosynthesis, residing in coherent
structures over many hundreds of kiloparsecs. Recent progress with cosmological
hydro-simulations based on hierarchical structure formation models has led to
important insights into the physical structures giving rise to the forest. If
these ideas are correct, a truely inter- and proto-galactic medium [at high
redshift (z ~ 3), the main repository of baryons] collapses under the influence
of dark matter gravity into flattened or filamentary structures, which are seen
in absorption against background QSOs. With decreasing redshift, galaxies
forming in the denser regions, may contribute an increasing part of the Lyman
alpha absorption cross-section. Comparisons between large data samples from the
new generation of telescopes and artificial Lyman alpha forest spectra from
cosmological simulations promise to become a useful cosmological tool.

respect to type 2s, Murayama & Taniguchi have proposed that the high-ionization
nuclear emission-line region (HINER) traced by the [FeVII]6087 emission resides
in the inner wall of dusty tori. The covering factor of the torus is usually
large (e.g., ~ 0.9). Further, electron density in the tori (e.g., ~ 10^7-10^8
cm-3) is considered to be higher significantly than that (e.g., ~ 10^3-10^4
cm^-3) in the narrow-line region (NLR). Therefore it is expected that the torus
emission contributes to the majority of the higher-ionization emission lines.
Taking this HINER component into account, we have constructed new
dual-component (i.e., a typical NLR with a HINER torus) photoionization models.
Comparison of our model with the observations show that that if the torus
emission contributes ~ 10 % of the NLR emission, our dual-component model can
explain the observed high [FeVII]6087/[OIII]5007 intensity ratios of the
Seyfert 1s without invoking any unusual assumptions (e.g., the overabundance of
iron).

evaporation of orbiting Kuiper belt-like objects. Here we extend the already
proposed Orbiting-Evaporating-Bodies (OEB) scenario in which the disk is a
gigantic multi-cometary tail supplied by slowly evaporating bodies like Chiron.
We show that the number of these OEBs must be several tens of millions, and
that this is consistent with the number of bodies needed to explain the
presence of CO and CI in the gaseous disk.
  We explore some possible origin of the required perturbation on the OEBs. If
dust is produced by evaporation, a planet with an eccentric orbit can explain
the observed asymmetry of the disk, because the periastron distribution of the
parent bodies are then expected to be non-axisymmetric. Following Malhotra
(1995), we investigate the consequence for the Kuiper belt-like objects of the
formation and the migration of an outer planet like Neptune in Fernandez's
scheme (Fernandez 1982). We find that bodies trapped in resonance with a
migrating planet can significantly evaporate, producing a Beta Pictoris-like
disk with similar characteristics like opening angle and asymmetry.
  We thus show that the Beta Pictoris disk can be a transient phenomenon. The
circumstellar disks around main sequence stars can be the signature of the

ladder and has remarkable properties which are studied using DMRG and recurrent
variational ansatzes. The AF Heisenberg model on this ladder is equivalent to
the alternating spin-1/spin-1/2 AFH chain which is known to have a
ferrimagnetic ground state (GS). For doping 1/3 the GS is a fully doped (1,1)
stripe with the holes located mostly along the principal diagonal while the
minor diagonals are occupied by spin singlets. This state can be seen as a Mott
insulator of localized Cooper pairs on the plaquettes. A physical picture of
our results is provided by a $t_p-J_p$ model of plaquettes coupled diagonally
with a hopping parameter $t_d$. In the limit $t_d \to \infty$ we recover the
original $t-J$ model on the necklace ladder while for weak hopping parameter
the model is easily solvable. The GS in the strong hopping regime is
essentially an ""on link"" Gutzwiller projection of the weak hopping GS. We
generalize the $t_p-J_p-t_d$ model to diagonal ladders with $n_p >1$ and the 2D
square lattice. We use in our construction concepts familiar in Statistical
Mechanics as medial graphs and Bratelli diagrams.

focus on two systems where experimental results are available: a wide single
and a narrow asymmetric double well. The aim is to calculate frequency and
linewidth of collective electronic modes damped via electron-electron
interaction only. Since Landau damping is not effective here, the dominant
damping mechanism involves dynamical exchange-correlation effects such as
multipair production. To capture these effects, one has to go beyond the widely
used adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) and include retardation. We
perform a comparative study of two approaches which fall in this category: the
dynamical extension of the ALDA by Gross and Kohn, and a more recent method
which treats exchange and correlation beyond the ALDA as viscoelastic stresses
in the electron liquid. We find that the former method is more robust: it
performs similarly for strongly different degrees of collectivity of the
electronic motion. Results for quantum wells compare reasonably to experiment,
with a tendency towards overdamping. By contrast, the viscoelastic approach is
superior for systems where the electron dynamics is predominantly collective,
but breaks down if the local velocity field is too rapidly varying, as in the
case of a single-electron-like behavior such as tunneling through a potential
barrier.

responsible for both generating the flavor spectrum and communicating
supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector. The problem of Flavor Changing
Neutral Currents is overcome, in part using an `Effective Supersymmetry'
spectrum among the squarks, with the first two generations very heavy. All
masses are generated dynamically and the theory is completely renormalizable.
The model contains a simple Froggatt-Nielsen sector and communicates
supersymmetry breaking via gauge mediation without requiring a separate
messenger sector. By forcing the theory to be consistent with SU(5) Grand
Unification, the model predicts a large tan beta and a massless up quark. While
respecting the experimental bounds on CP violation in the K-system, the model
leads to a large enhancement of CP violation in B-(B bar) mixing as well as in
B decay amplitudes.

bases. With this approach, interpolation and restriction operators and grids
for the multigrid algorithm are predetermined by an interpolating
multiresolution analysis. We will present the new method and contrast its
efficiency with standard wavelet and multigrid approaches.

  1997 article in the Amer. J. Phys",,,"LBNL-41813","quant-ph",,"  A recent proof, formulated in the symbolic language of modal logic, shows
that a well-defined formulation of the possibility mentioned in the title is
answered affirmatively. In the paper being commented upon several proposals
were made about how to translate this symbolic proof into prose, and it was
concluded, on the basis of those proposed translations, that either the proof
was invalid or that an unwarranted reality assumption was made. However, those
interpretations deviate in small but important ways from the precise logical
path followed in the proof. It is explained here how by staying on this path
one avoids the difficulties that those deviations engendered.

wavefunction to emphasize the role of the observer. Such a framework is found
to be very effective in the study of the measurement problem and time's arrow.
Measurement in classical and quantum theory is given a unified treatment. With
the introduction of the concept of uncertainty quantum which is the basic unit
of measurement, we show that the time's arrow within the uncertainty quantum is
just opposite to the time's arrow in the observable reality. A special constant
is discussed which explains our sensation of time and provides a permanent
substrate for all change. It is shown that the whole spacetime connects
together in a delicate structure.

is considered with the boundary conditions equal to zero at the origin and
initial condition chosen arbitrary decreasing rapidly enough and this problem
is plunged into the scheme of the inverse scattering method. Here the inverse
scattering problem is reduced to the Riemann problem on a system of rays on the
complex plane.
