presence of two prominent radio sources, Sgr A East and its surrounding Halo,
containing non-thermal particle distributions with power-law indices around
2.5-3.3 and 2.4, respectively. The central 1-2 pc region is also a source of
intense (stellar) UV and (dust-reprocessed) far-IR radiation that bathes these
extended synchrotron-emitting structures. A recent detection of gamma-rays
(2EGJ1746-2852) from within around 1 degree of the Galactic Center by EGRET
onboard the Compton GRO shows that the emission from this environment extends
to very high energies.
  We suggest that inverse Compton scatterings between the power-law electrons
inferred from the radio properties of Sgr A East and its Halo, and the UV and
IR photons from the nucleus, may account for the possibly diffuse gamma-ray
source as well. We show that both particle distributions may be contributing to
the gamma-ray emission, though their relevant strength depends on the actual
physical properties (such as the magnetic field intensity) in each source. If
this picture is correct, the high-energy source at the Galactic Center is
extended over several arcminutes, which can be tested with thenext generation
of gamma-ray and hard X-ray missions.

masses for the white dwarf and M dwarf directly (0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses and
0.096 +/- 0.004 solar masses, respectively). We use a simple model of the CaII

from its surface to be proportional to the incident flux per unit area from the
white dwarf. The radius derived is 0.125 +/- 0.020 solar radii. The M dwarf
appears to be a normal main-sequence star in terms of its mass and radius and
is less than half the size of its Roche lobe. The thermal timescale of the M
dwarf is much longer than the cooling age of the white dwarf so we conclude
that the M dwarf was unaffected by the common-envelope phase. The anomalous

confirms that the pulsar has a characteristic age of only 8 kyr, the sixth
smallest of all known pulsars. The unusual apparent youth of the pulsar and its

Although the respective ages and distances are consistent within substantial

explain given the observed pulsar velocity distribution, the absence of

argue that the objects are likely superposed on the sky; this is reasonable
given the complex area. Without an association, the question of where is the

adequate resolution. This technology allows for the solution of problems in a
manner that is both more efficient and more versatile than other fixed and

discussed. Such simulations involve many orders of magnitude of variation in
length scale as fragments form. In this paper we briefly describe the
methodology and present an illustrative application for nonisothermal cloud
collapse. We describe the numerical Jeans condition, a criterion for stability

the evolution of a postburst fireball is in an intermediate case between the
adiabatic and highly radiative expansion. In our model, the afterglow is both
due to the contribution of the adiabatic electrons behind the external
blastwave of the fireball and due to the contribution of the radiative
electrons. In addition, this model can describe evolution of the fireball from
the extremely relativistic phase to the non-relativistic phase. Our
calculations show that the fireball will go to the adiabatic expansion phase
after about a day if the accelerated electrons are assumed to occupy the total
internal energy. In all cases considered, the fireball will go to the mildly
relativistic phase about $10^4$ seconds later, and to the non-relativistic
phase after several days. These results imply that the relativistic adiabatic
model cannot describe the deceleration dynamics of the several-days-later
fireball. The comparison of the calculated light curves with the observed
results at late times may imply the presence of impulsive events or energy
injection with much longer durations.

the Galactic and cosmic chemical evolution models. In our SN Ia progenitor
scenario, the accreting white dwarf (WD) blows a strong wind to reach the
Chandrasekhar mass limit. If the iron abundance of the progenitors is as low as
[Fe/H] < -1, then the wind is too weak for SNe Ia to occur. Our model
successfully reproduces the observed chemical evolution in the solar
neighborhood. We make the following predictions which can test this metallicity
effect: 1) SNe Ia are not found in the low-iron abundance environments such as
dwarf galaxies and the outskirts of spirals. 2) The cosmic SN Ia rate drops at
z \sim 1-2 due to the low-iron abundance, which can be observed with the Next
Generation Space Telescope. At z > 1-2, SNe Ia can be found only in the
environments where the timescale of metal enrichment is sufficiently short as
in starburst galaxies and ellipticals.
  The low-metallicity inhibition of SNe Ia can shed new light on the following
issues: 1) The limited metallicity range of the SN Ia progenitors would imply
that ``evolution effects'' are relatively small for the use of high redshift
SNe Ia to determine the cosmological parameters. 2) WDs of halo populations are
poor producers of SNe Ia, so that the WD contribution to the halo mass is not
constrained from the iron abundance in the halo. 3) The abundance patterns of
globular clusters and field stars in the Galactic halo lack of SN Ia signatures
in spite of their age difference of several Gyrs, which can be explained by the
low-metallicity inhibition of SNe Ia. 4) It could also explain why the SN Ia
contamination is not seen in the damped Ly\alpha systems for over a wide range
of redshift.

ratio and its distribution in the C-O white dwarfs by calculating stellar
evolution from the main-sequence through the end of the second dredge-up for
M=3-9 Mo and Z=0.001-0.03. We find that the total carbon mass fraction just
before SN Ia explosion varies in the range 0.36 -- 0.5. We also calculate the
metallicity dependence of the main-sequence-mass range of the SN Ia progenitor

these regions. The low ionization lines in these spectra can be best explained
as arising in gas that is partially shielded from the ionizing continuum.
  Although the predicted line ratios from the photoionization models provide a
good fit to the observed ratios, it is apparent that the model predictions of
electron temperatures in the ionized gas are too low. We interpret this as an
indication of additional collisional heating due to shocks and/or energetic
particles associated with the radio jet that traverses the NLR of NGC 1068. The
density structure within each region may also be the result of compression by
the jet.

collisionless shock is suggested. In this model the MHD-turbulence behind the

originated upstream from the turbulence excited by particles leaking from the
downstream medium. It is argued that such a wave having significantly increased
its magnetic field during the transmission through the shock interface can
effectively trap thermal ions, regulating their leakage upstream. Together with
a background turbulence this wave also plays a fundamental role in
thermalization of the incoming ion flow. The spectrum of leaking particles and
the amplitude of the wave excited by these particles are selfconsistently
calculated. The injection rate into the first order Fermi acceleration based on
this leakage mechanism is obtained and compared with computer simulations. The
related problem of shock energy distribution between thermal and nonthermal

three different functional forms of the redshift distribution $N(z)$, different
spatial correlation functions and by different evolutions of the bias $b(z)$
with redshift. We also consider the two cases of open and flat Universes.
Although the predicted $w(\theta)$ show substantial differences due to
differences in the $N(z)$'s, these differences are not significant compared to
the uncertainties in the current observations. It turns out that the best fit
is provided by models with constant biasing at all times, although the
difference between models with epoch-independent bias and models with bias that
evolves linearly with redshift is not very large. All models with strong
evolution of bias with epoch are ruled out. As a further step we directly
calculated $w_{obs}(\theta)$ at 3mJy from the catalogue and matched it with our
models for the angular correlation function in the hypothesis that the
clustering signal comes from two different populations, namely AGN-powered
sources and starbursting galaxies. The results are consistent with a scenario
for hierarchical clustering where the fainter starbursting galaxies trace the
mass at all epochs, while brighter AGN's are strongly biased, with $b(z)$

3DIM at one values of its parameters, and represent a model for the edge
excitations, which are responsible for the plato transitions in the Hall
effect, at other values. The model can be formulated also as a loop gas models
in 2D, but unlikely the O(n) models, where the loop fugacity is real, here we
have directed (clochwise and conterclochwise) loops and phase factors $e^{\pm
2\pi {p \over q} i}$ for them. The line of phase transitions in the parametric
space will be found and corresponding continuum limits of this models will be
constructed. It appears, that besides the ordinary critical line, which
separates the dense and diluted phases of the models(like in ordinary O(n)
models), there is a line, which corresponds to the full covering of the space
by curves. The N=2 twisted superconformal models with SU(2)/U(1) coset model

every single deposition event. We have implemented the method using the
effective medium theory as a model potential for the atomic interactions, and
present simulations for Ag/Ag(111) and Pt/Pt(111) for incoming energies up to
35 eV. The method is capable of following the growth of several monolayers at
realistic growth rates of 1 monolayer per second, correctly accounting for both
energy-induced atomic mobility and thermal surface diffusion. We find that the
energy influences island and step densities and can induce layer-by-layer
growth. We find an optimal energy for layer-by-layer growth (25 eV for Ag),
which correlates with where the net impact-induced downward interlayer
transport is at a maximum. A high step density is needed for energy induced
layer-by-layer growth, hence the effect dies away at increased temperatures,
where thermal surface diffusion reduces the step density. As part of the
development of the method, we present molecular dynamics simulations of single
atom-surface collisions on flat parts of the surface and near straight steps,
we identify microscopic mechanisms by which the energy influences the growth,

information on the CKM angle alpha coming from the measurement of the
time-dependent B0(t) -> pi+pi- CP-asymmetry. Nevertheless, we show that this
information can be summarized in a set of simple equations, expressing alpha as
a multi-valued function of a single theoretically unknown parameter, which
conveniently can be chosen as a well-defined ratio of penguin to tree
amplitudes. Using these exact analytic expressions, free of any assumption
besides the Standard Model, and some reasonable hypotheses to constrain the
modulus of the penguin amplitude, we derive several new upper bounds on the
penguin-induced shift |2alpha-2alpha_eff|, generalizing the recent result of
Grossman and Quinn. These bounds depend on the averaged branching ratios of
some decays (pi0pi0, K0K0bar, K+-pi-+) particularly sensitive to the penguin.
On the other hand, with further and less conservative approximations, we show
that the knowledge of the B+- -> Kpi+- branching ratio alone gives sufficient
information to extract the free parameter without the need of other
measurements, and without knowing |V_td| or |V_ub|. More generally, knowing the
modulus of the penguin amplitude with an accuracy of ~30% might result in an
extraction of alpha competitive with the experimentally more difficult isospin
analysis. We also show that our framework allows to recover most of the
previous approaches in a transparent and simple way, and in some cases to
improve them. In addition we discuss in detail the problem of the various kinds

of two-loop anomalous dimensions. We present an explicit calculation of the 6

of the positivity of $L$ can be concentrated at any given point of $A$. There
has been considerable recent interest in finding bounds on the Seshadri
constants of abelian varieties and on smooth projective varieties in general.
In the present paper we first generalize an approach of Buser and Sarnak to
give a lower bound on the minimal period length of $(A,L)$ in terms of the type
of the polarization, which by a recent result of Lazarsfeld leads to a lower
bound on the Seshadri constant of $(A,L)$. Secondly, we consider Prym varieties

closer than 1500 km. The complexity of Lg waveforms makes it difficult to
consistently determine Lg arrival time, thus affecting source location with a
single station or array. This study tests an automatic method for timing Lg
arrivals using wavelet transforms to decompose the Lg signal into its
components localized both in time and scale. A Continuous Wavelet Transform
(CWT) using a Daubechies order two (db2) wavelet is applied to 10 seconds of
raw data, containing the start of Lg. Initial positioning of the window is
obtained using the standard Lg travel time tables. The coefficients at scale 8
from the db2 decomposition are squared and the resulting time series is
represented by an approximation of the 4'th level Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) using a Haar wavelet. A threshold detector is then applied to the
resulting time series to determine the Lg arrival time. The method was tested
using well located earthquakes (USGS) and explosions from known mines (mb less
than 4.0), recorded on the vertical components at TXAR (Lajitas, Texas) and
PDAR (Pinedale, Wyoming) arrays. The Lg arrival time was automatically picked
with a standard deviation of less than 1.5 seconds (less than 10 km location
error) for well known locations. Location errors are larger with the increase
in distance and smaller with the increase in signal to noise ratio of events.

  boundary conditions of a classical universe?","32 pages, LaTex",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The problem of defining the boundary conditions for the universe is
considered here in the framework of a classical dynamical theory, pointing out
that a measure on boundary conditions must be included in the theory in order
to explain the statistical regularities of evolution. It is then suggested that
quantum statistical regularities also could derive from this measure. An
explicit definition of such a measure is proposed, using both a simplified
model of the universe based on classical mechanics and the non-relativistic
quantum mechanics formalism. The peculiarity of such a measure is that it does
not apply to the initial conditions of the universe, i.e. to the initial
positions and momenta of particles, but to their initial and final positions,
from which the path is derived by means of the least action principle. This
formulation of the problem is crucial and it is supported by the observation
that it is incorrect to liken the determination of the boundary conditions of
the universe to the preparation of a laboratory system, in which the initial
conditions of the system are obviously determined. Some possible objections to
this theory are then discussed. Specifically, the EPR paradox is discussed, and
it is explained by showing that, in general, a measure on the boundary
conditions of the universe generates preinteractive correlations, and that in
the presence of such correlations Bell's inequality can no longer be proven
true. Finally, it is shown that if one broadens the dynamical scheme of the
theory to encompass phenomena such as particle decay and annihilation, the
least action principle allows for an indeterministic evolution of the system.

have an intersection of finite codimension, then the corresponding solutions of
the KP hierarchy are linked by B\""acklund-Darboux transformations (BDT). The
pseudodifferential operator that performs this transformation is shown to be
built up in a geometric way from elementary BDT's and is given here in a closed
form. The geometric description of elementary DBT's requires that one has a
geometric interpretation of the dual wavefunctions involved. This is done here
with the help of a suitable algebraic characterization of the wavefunction. The
BDT's also induce transformations of the tau-function associated to a plane in
the Grassmannian. For the Gelfand-Dickey hierarchies we derive a geometric
characterization of the BDT'ss that preserves these subsystems of the KP
hierarchy. This generalizes the classical Darboux-transformations. we also
determine an explicit expression for the squared eigenfunction potentials. Next
a connection is laid between the KP hierarchy and the 1-Toda lattice hierarchy.
It is shown that infinite flags in the Grassmannian yield solutions of the
latter hierarchy. these flags can be constructed by means of BDT's, starting
from some plane. Other applications of these BDT's are a geometric way to
characterize Wronskian solutions of the $m$-vector $k$-constrained KP hierarchy
and the construction of a vast collection of orthogonal polynomials, playing a
role in matrix models.
