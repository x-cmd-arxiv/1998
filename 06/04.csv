  Astrophysics in press",,,"BAP 06-1998-019-OAB","astro-ph",,"  In this paper we present the results of a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in
an area between the two clusters of galaxies A548 and A3367, suspected to be a
close and interacting pair. With the use of multifiber spectroscopy, we
measured 180 new velocities of galaxies in the central part of A3367 and in the
external regions of A548.
  The redshift histogram shows the presence of three velocity peaks, at v ~
12000 km/s, v ~ 30000 km/s and v ~ 40000 km/s, respectively. For these we
estimate the density excess, the mean velocity, and the velocity dispersion.
  The first clump corresponds to an elongation of A548: in particular we found
a correspondence between the features of this peak and the substructures of
A548. The second peak has a velocity dispersion which is typical of clusters
and the distribution of its members on the plane of the sky corresponds to the
highest density peak in A3367. We therefore suggest that the name A3367 has to
be attributed to this clump.
  Our general conclusion is that, differently from expected, A548 and A3367 do
not form a close pair of merging clusters, since the two structures are at
significantly different redshifts. Moreover, we found that the complex
dynamical structure of A548 has large coherence, with a projected extension in
the range of 1-3 Mpc.

phase of its recent outburst. The observations were carried out at a typical
rate of once or twice per day. The source shows interesting spectral evolution
during this period. Phenomenologically, it bears remarkable similarities to
``atoll'' sources. Shortly after the onset of the outburst, the source is seen
to be in an ``island'' state, but with little X-ray variability. It then
appears to have made a rapid spectral transition (on a time scale less than
half a day) to another ``island'' state, where it evolves slightly and stays
for 4 days. In this state, the observed X-ray flux becomes increasingly
variable as the source brightens. Quasi-period oscillation (QPO) in the X-ray
intensity is detected in the frequency range 670--870 Hz. The QPO frequency
increases with the X-ray flux while its fractional rms decreases. The QPO
becomes undetectable following a transition to a ``banana'' state, where the
source continues its evolution by moving up and down the ``banana'' branch in
the color-color diagram as the flux (presumably, the mass accretion rate)
fluctuates around the peak of the outburst. Throughout the entire period, the
power density spectrum is dominated by very-low frequency noises. Little power
can be seen above ~1 Hz, which is different from typical ``atoll'' sources. In
the ``banana'' state, the overall X-ray variability remains low (with
fractional rms ~3--4%) but roughly constant. The observed X-ray spectrum is
soft with few photons from above $\sim$25 keV, implying the thermal origin of
the emission. The evolution of both spectral and temporal X-ray properties is
discussed in the context of disk-instability models.

in SCDM models. The magnification probability function presents a moderate
degree of evolution up to $z\approx 5$ (CHDM) and $z\approx 7$ (SCDM/LCDM). All
models predict that statistically large magnifications, $\mu \simgt 20$ are
achievable, with a probability of the order of a fraction of percent, the SCDM
model being the most efficient magnifier. All cosmologies predict that above
$z\approx 4$ there is a 10% chance to get magnifications larger than 3. We have
explored the observational perspectives for Pop III SNe detection with NGST
when gravitational magnification is taken into account. We find that NGST
should be able to detect and confirm spectroscopically Type II SNe up to a
redshift of $z \approx 4$ in the J band (for $T_{SN}=25000$ K); this limit
could be increased up to $z\approx 9$ in the K band, allowing for a relatively
moderate magnification. Possibly promising strategies to discriminate among
cosmological models using their GL magnification predictions and very high-$z$
SNe are sketched. Finally, we outline and discuss the limitations of our study.

technique for modelling the three-dimensional structure of the core by
simulating spectral line images of the source and comparing those images to
observed data. The primary conclusions of this work are that the molecular gas
in e2 is radially contracting at about 5 km/s and that the temperature and
density of the gas decrease outward over 0.15 pc scales. The simple model of
the collapse of the singular isothermal sphere for low-mass star formation (Shu
1977) is an inadequate description of this high-mass molecular core; better
models have temperature decreasing outward as r^-0.6, density as r^-2, and
velocity increasing as r^+0.1. The core appears to be spherical rather than
disk-like at the scale of these observations, 0.3 pc. In this paper we show how
a series of models of gradually increasing complexity can be used to
investigate the sensitivity of the model to its parameters. Major sources of
uncertainty for this method and this dataset are the interdependence of
temperature and density and the assumed NH3 abundance.

substructure form as density fluctuations induced by large scale interstellar
turbulence. We do this by investigating the topology of various fields in
realistic simulations of the ISM. We find that a) the velocity field is
continuous across threshold-defined cloud boundaries; b) such cloud boundaries
are rather arbitrary, with no correspondence to any actual physical boundary,
such as a density discontinuity; c) abrupt velocity jumps are coincident with
the density maxima; d) the volume and surface kinetic terms in the Eulerian
Virial Theorem for a cloud ensemble are comparable in general; e) the magnetic
field exhibits bends and reversals highly correlated with similar density
features. These results suggest that clouds are formed by colliding gas
streams. Within this framework, we argue that thermal pressure equilibrium is
irrelevant for cloud confinement in a turbulent medium, since inertial motions
can still distort or disrupt a cloud. Turbulent pressure confinement appears
self-defeating, because turbulence contains large-scale motions which
necessarily distort cloud boundaries. Density-weighted velocity histograms show
similar FWHMs and similar multi-component structure to those of observational
line profiles, though the histogram features do not correspond to isolated
""clumps"", but rather to extended regions throughout a cloud. We argue that the
results presented here may be also applicable to small scales with larger
densities (molecular clouds and cores) and suggest that quasi- hydrostatic
configurations cannot be produced from turbulent fluctuations unless the
thermodynamic behavior of the flow becomes nearly adiabatic at late stages of
collapse. We expect this to occur only at protostellar densities.

increases the temperature of the outer disk relative to the purely viscous
case. As a consequence, the outer disk (R larger than 5 AU) becomes less dense,
optically thin and almost vertically isothermal, with a temperature
distribution T proportional to R^{-1/2}. The decrease in surface density at the
outer disk, decreases the disk mass by a factor of 4 respect to a purely
viscous case. In addition, irradiation tends to make the outer disk regions
stable against gravitational instabilities.

dusty, star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The disturbed and
interacting galaxies constitute the largest class, which suggests that
interactions remain an important mechanism for triggering star formation and
the formation of ultraluminous galaxies in the distant Universe. The faint,
compact galaxies may represent a later evolutionary stage in these mergers, or
more centrally-concentrated starbursts. It is likely that some of these will
host AGN. Analysis of the colors of our sample allow us to estimate a crude
redshift distribution: >75% have z<5.5 whilst >50% lie at z<4.5, suggesting
that the luminous sub-mm population is coeval with the more modestly

obscured from view in the optical waveband by dust, and so is missing from
existing inventories of star formation in the distant Universe. By including
this population we can construct a complete and consistent picture of the
history of star formation. The evolution of obscured star formation at
redshifts less than unity is constrained by mid- and far-infrared counts of
dusty galaxies. Activity increases with redshift z as (1+z) to a power of about
4, consistent with the form of evolution found in the optical waveband by the
Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) to redshifts less than about 1. The form
of evolution at higher redshifts is constrained by both our faint SCUBA counts
and the intensity of background radiation in the millimetre/submillimetre

about five times greater than that inferred from restframe ultraviolet
observations, and that a larger fraction of this energy is emitted at high
redshifts. The simplest explanation for these results is that a large

investigate the effects of the disk-to-halo mass ratio, the disk scale length,
the disk inclination to the line of sight and the lens redshift on two
strong-lensing cross sections: the cross section for multiple imaging, and the
cross section for large magnifications, in excess of a factor of 10. We find
that the multiple-imaging cross section can be enhanced significantly by an
almost edge-on Milky Way disk as compared with a singular isothermal sphere
(SIS) in individual cases; however, when averaged over all disk inclinations,
the cross section is only increased by about fifty per cent. These results are
consistent with other recent work. The presence of a disk, however, increases
the inclination-averaged high-magnification cross section by an order of
magnitude as compared with a SIS. This result has important implications for
magnification bias in future lens surveys, particularly those in the
submillimetre waveband, where dust extinction in the lensing galaxy has no
effect on the brightness of the images.

gamma-ray production is dominated by inverse Compton scattering of external
radiation (ERC). The dependence of the flare properties on magnetic field
dissipation rate, intensity of ambient radiation, and the thickness of expelled
fluid slabs is analyzed. It is shown that i) the type of gamma-ray flare
produced by the model is determined by the ratio of the thickness of ejected
fluid slab and the gradient length scale of ambient radiation intensity, ii)
the radiative efficiency depends sensitively on the opacity contributed by the
background radiation, owing to a radiative feedback, and is typically very high
for parameters characteristic to the powerful blazars, and iii) the emitted
flux is strongly suppressed at energies for which the pair-production optical
depth is initially larger than unity; the time lag and flare duration in this

functions of rich clusters of galaxies from linear density fluctuations, based
on the formalism of Gaussian peaks (Bardeen et al 1986). The essential, new
ingredient in the current approach is a simultaneous and unique fixture of the
size of the smoothing window for the density field, $r_f$, and the critical
height for collapse of a density peak, $\delta_c$, for a given cluster mass
(enclosed within the sphere of a given radius rather than the virial radius,
which is hard to measure observationally). Of these two parameters, $r_f$
depends on both the mass of the cluster in question and $\Omega$, whereas
$\delta_c$ is a function of only $\Omega$ and $\Lambda$. These two parameters
have formerly been treated as adjustable and approximate parameters. Thus, for
the first time, the Gaussian Peak Method (GPM) becomes unambiguous, and more
importantly, accurate, as is shown here. We apply this method to constrain all
variants of the Gaussian cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model using the
observed abundance of local rich clusters of galaxies and the microwave
background temperature fluctuations observed by COBE. The combined constraint
fixes the power spectrum of any model to $\sim 10%$ accuracy in both the shape
and overall amplitude. To set the context for analyzing CDM models, we choose
six representative models of current interest, including an $\Omega_0=1$ tilted
cold dark matter model, a mixed hot and cold dark matter model with 20% mass in
neutrinos, two lower density open models with $\Omega_0=0.25$ and

couple to a U_1 gauge field, give rise to anomalous electric currents, the
anomaly being related to the Hall conductivity. The well known $O(n,n;Z)$
duality group associated with such toroidal conformal field theories transforms
the edge states and Hall conductivities in a way which makes interesting
connections between different theories, e.g. between systems exhibiting the
integer and fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we try to explore the
extension of these constructions to the case where such bosons live on a
n-dimensional orbifold. We give a general formalism for discussing the relevant
quantities like the Hall conductance and their transformation under the duality
groups present in orbifold compactifications. We illustrate these ideas by
presenting a detailed analysis of a toy model based on the two-dimensional Z_3
orbifold. In this model we obtain new classes of filling fractions, which
generally the correspond to fermionic edge states carrying fractional electric
charge. We also consider the relation between orbifold edge theories and
Luttinger liquids (LL's), which in the past have provided important insights

the valleys of the conductance as a function of Fermi energy $E_F$ is called
the conductance energy correlation range $E_c$. Under the ergodic hypothesis,
the latter is determined by the half-width of the ensemble averaged conductance
correlation function: $F= < \delta g(E_F) \delta g(E_F + \Delta E) >$. In
ordinary diffusive metals, $E_c\sim D/L^2$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant
and $L$ is the linear dimension of the phase-coherent sample. However, near a
quantum phase transition driven by the location of the Fermi energy $E_F$, the
above picture breaks down. As an example of the latter, we study, for the first

$F$ is determined by the interplay between the static and the dynamic

forces mimic a stochastic background of gravitational waves and thus constitute
noise. We compute this noise using the theory of multimode Rayleigh and Love
waves propagating in a layered medium that approximates the geological strata
at the LIGO sites. We characterize the noise by a transfer function $T(f)
\equiv \tilde x(f)/\tilde W(f)$ from the spectrum of direction averaged ground
motion $\tilde W(f)$ to the spectrum of test mass motion $\tilde x(f) = L\tilde
h(f)$ (where $L$ is the length of the interferometer's arms, and $\tilde h(f)$
is the spectrum of gravitational-wave noise). This paper's primary foci are (i)
a study of how $T(f)$ depends on the various seismic modes; (ii) an attempt to
estimate which modes are excited at the LIGO sites at quiet and noisy times;
and (iii) a corresponding estimate of the seismic gravity-gradient noise level.
At quiet times the noise is below the benchmark noise level of ``advanced LIGO
interferometers'' (although not by much near 10 Hz); it may significantly
exceed this level at noisy times. The lower edge of our quiet-time noise is a
limit beyond which there is little gain from further improvements in vibration
isolation and thermal noise, unless one also reduces seismic gravity-gradient
noise. Two methods of reduction are discussed: monitoring the earth's density
perturbations, computing their gravitational forces, and correcting the data
for those forces; and constructing narrow moats around the interferometers'
test masses to shield out the fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves, which we suspect
dominate at quiet times.

This last solution happens to be unstable and a star, becoming massive enough
to allow for all three solutions, evolves to reach one of the strong field
configurations. This transition is dynamically computed and it appears that the
star radiates away the difference in energy between both states (a few $10^{-3}

10^{-5} M_\odot c^2$) is injected into the star as kinetic energy, the velocity
of star's surface can reach up to $10^{-2} c$. The waveform of this monopolar

the ''stringy'' 2-form axion potential vanishes) is formally the same as the
Brans-Dicke action with $\omega =-1$. We show that, unlike the case of general
relativity in vacuum, there is no Mixmaster chaos in these string cosmologies.
In the Einstein frame an infinite sequence of chaotic oscillations of the scale
factors on approach to the initial singularity is impossible, as it was in
general relativistic Mixmaster universes in the presence of stiff -fluid matter
(or a massless scalar field). A finite sequence of oscillations of the scale
factors approximated by Kasner metrics is possible, but it always ceases when
all expansion rates become positive. In the string frame the evolution through
Kasner epochs changes to a new form which reflects the duality symmetry of the
theory. Again, we show that chaotic oscillations must end after a finite time.
The need for duality symmetry appears to be incompatible with the presence of
chaotic behaviour as $t\to 0$. We obtain our results using the Hamiltonian
qualitative cosmological picture for Mixmaster models. We mention possible
relations of this picture to diffeomorphism-independent methods of measuring
chaos in general relativity. Finally, we discuss the effect of inhomogeneities
and higher dimensions on the possible emergence of chaos within the string

of the thermal coupling constant is quite different in odd or even dimensional

diferent from zero and then grows up monotonically as the temperature
increases. In the case D=4, it is found that the thermal renormalized coupling

(2.7 - i 0.3)$ fm$^4$ can be reproduced by contributions from tree level chiral
(long-range) pion exchange and short-range effects related to vector meson
exchanges, with $\omega$ exchange giving the largest individual contribution.
Pion loop effects appear to be small. We stress that the commonly used heavy
baryon formalism is not applicable in the NN-system above the pion production
threshold due to the large external momentum, $|\vec p | \simeq \sqrt
{Mm_\pi}$, with $M$ and $m_\pi$ the nucleon and the pion mass, respectively. We
furthermore investigate the reaction $pp\to p n \pi^+$ near threshold within
the same approach. We extract from the data the triplet threshold amplitude as
${\cal B}= (2.8 -i 1.5)$ fm$^4$. Its real part can be well understood from
(relativistic) tree level meson-exchange diagrams. In addition, we investigate
the process $pp \to pp \eta$ near threshold. We use a simple factorization
ansatz for the $pp\eta$ final-state interaction and extract from the data the
modulus of the threshold amplitude, $|{\cal C}| = 1.32 $fm$^4$. With $g_{\eta
N}=5.3$, this value can be reproduced by (relativistic) tree level
meson-exchange diagrams and $\eta$-rescattering, whose strength is fixed by the
$\eta N$ scattering length. We also comment on the recent near threshold data
for $\eta'$-production.

electromagnetic current operator, here we extend the treatment to include meson
exchange current operators. We focus on one-particle emission electronuclear
reactions. In contrast to the traditional scheme where approximations are made
for the transferred momentum, transferred energy and momenta of the
initial-state struck nucleons, we treat the problem exactly for the transferred
energy and momentum, thus obtaining new current operators which retain
important aspects of relativity not taken into account in the traditional
non-relativistic reductions. We calculate the matrix elements of our current
operators between the Fermi sphere and a particle-hole state for several
choices of kinematics. We present a comparison between our results using
approximate current operators and those obtained using the fully-relativistic
operators, as well as with results obtained using the traditional
non-relativistic current operators.
