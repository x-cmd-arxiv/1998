moderately deep I-band observations obtained in the first of four patches
surveyed, covering a region of 3.2 square degrees centered at R.A. 22h40m and
Dec. -40d. The products available to the community, including pixel maps (with
astrometric and photometric calibrations) and the corresponding object

preliminary estimates are presented for the star and galaxy number counts, and
for the angular two-point correlation function obtained from the available
data. The present work is meant as a preview of the final release of the EIS

proto-planetary nebula or young stellar object? We present the first 2 micron

approximately 70 stars inside a 30 arcsec radius around a bright, possibly
resolved, central object. The derived stellar luminosity function is consistent
with that expected from a single coeval population, and the brightness of the
nebulosity is consistent with the predicted flux of unresolved low-mass stars.
The stars and nebulosity are spatially coincident with strong CO line emission.
We therefore identify IRAS 06562-0337 as a new young star cluster embedded in
its placental molecular cloud. The central object is likely a Herbig Be star, M
approx 20 M_sun, which may be seen in reflection. We present medium resolution,

previously published spectra shows new evidence for time variable permitted and

arising from a circumstellar disk around T Tau N and estimate its properties by
fitting a flat-disk model to visibilities at wavelengths of 1 and 3 mm and to
the flux density at 7 mm. Given the data, probability distributions are
calculated for values of the free parameters, including the temperature,
density, dust opacity, and the disk outer radius. The radial variation in
temperature and density is not narrowly constrained by the data. The most
likely value of the frequency dependence of the dust opacity, beta =
0.53^{+0.27}_{-0.17}, is consistent with that of disks around other T Tauri
stars in which grain growth is believed to have taken place. The outer radius,
R = 41^{+26}_{-14} AU, is smaller than the projected binary separation, and may
indicate truncation of the disk. The total mass estimated for the disk,
log(M/M_sun) = {-2.4}^{+0.7}_{-0.6}, is similar to masses observed around many
young single sources and to the minimum nebular mass required to form a
planetary system like our own. This observation strongly suggests that the

with the HST/FOS on 1994 August and November is analyzed with eclipse mapping
techniques to produce spatially resolved spectra of its accretion disc and gas
stream as a function of distance from disc centre.
  The inner accretion disc is characterized by a blue continuum filled with
absorption bands and lines which cross over to emission with increasing disc
radius, similar to that reported by Rutten et al (1994) at optical wavelengths.
The comparison of spatially resolved spectra at different azimuths reveals a
significant asymmetry in the disc emission at UV wavelengths, with the disc
side closest to the secondary star showing pronounced absorption by an `iron
curtain' and a Balmer jump in absorption. These results suggest the existence
of an absorbing ring of cold gas whose density and/or vertical scale increase
with disc radius. The spectrum of the infalling gas stream is noticeably
different from the disc spectrum at the same radius suggesting that gas
overflows through the impact point at disc rim and continues along the stream
trajectory, producing distinct emission down to 0.1 RL1.
  The radial temperature profiles of the continuum maps are well described by a
steady-state disc model in the inner and intermediate disc regions. There is
evidence of an increase in the mass accretion rate from August to November
(from Mdot= 10^{-8.3 +/- 0.1} to 10^{-8.1 +/- 0.1} Msun/yr), in accordance with
the observed increase in brightness. Since the UX UMa disc seems to be in a
high mass accretion, high-viscosity regime in both epochs, this result suggests
that the mass transfer rate of UX UMa varies substantially (~ 50 per cent) on
time scales of a few months.

conservative estimates allow us to confidently conclude that, in the frequency
range 100--200 GHz, their contaminating effect is well below the expected
anisotropy level of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), down to angular
scales of at least $\simeq 10'$. Hence, an accurate subtraction of foreground
fluctuations is not critical for the determination of the CMB power spectrum up
to multipoles $\ell \simeq 1000$. In any case, Planck's wide frequency coverage
will allow to carefully control foreground contributions.On the other hand, the

renormalization group analysis around an upper critical line. The freedom to
optimize with respect to the expansion point on this line allows us to obtain
the exponent \nu of standard field theory to much better precision that the
usual 1-loop calculations. Some other field theoretical techniques, such as the
large N limit and Hartree approximation, can also be applied to this model. By
comparison of low and high temperature expansions, we arrive at a conjecture
for the nature of droplets dominating the 3d-Ising model at criticality, which
is satisfied by our numerical results. We can also construct an appropriate
generalization that describes cubic anisotropy, by adding an interaction
between manifolds of the same color. The two parameter space includes a variety
of new phases and fixed points, some with Ising criticality, enabling us to
extract a remarkably precise value of 0.6315 for the exponent \nu in d=3. A
particular limit of the model with cubic anisotropy corresponds to the random
bond Ising problem; unlike the field theory formulation, we find a fixed point
describing this system at 1-loop order.

point out that there is one correction which is actually of order $\alpha$
times a function of the ratio $\mu_r \alpha / m_e$, where $\mu_r$ is the
reduced mass of the system. When $\mu_r \alpha \ll m_e$, this function can be
Taylor expanded and leads to higher order corrections. When $\mu_r \alpha
\approx m_e$, as is the case in pionium, the function is of order one and the
correction is of order $\alpha$. We use an effective field theory approach to
calculate this correction and find it equal to $0.4298 \alpha \Gamma_0$. We

of all the matter and radiation in the Universe today. The inflationary model
predicts that the oscillations of the scalar field at the end of inflation will
convert the coherent energy density of the inflaton into a large number of
particles, responsible for the present entropy of the Universe. The transition
from the inflationary era to the radiation era was originally called reheating,
and we now understand that it may consist of three different stages:
preheating, in which the homogeneous inflaton field decays coherently into
bosonic waves (scalars and/or vectors) with large occupation numbers;
backreaction and rescattering, in which different energy bands get mixed; and
finally decoherence and thermalization, in which those waves break up into
particles that thermalize and acquire a black body spectrum at a certain
temperature. These three stages are non-perturbative, non-linear and out of
equilibrium, and we are just beginning to understand them. In this talk I will
concentrate on the preheating part, putting emphasis on the differences between
preheating in chaotic and in hybrid inflation.

the thermodynamics: Considering the black hole as a thermodynamic system with
two thermodynamic variables (the mass $M$ and the angular momemtum $J$), we
obtain two-dimensional Riemannian thermodynamic geometry described by positive
definite Ruppeiner metric. From the thermodynamic curvature we find that the
extremal limit is the critical point. The effective spatial dimension of the
statistical system corresponding to the near-extremal BTZ black holes is one.
Far from the extremal point, the effective dimension becomes less than one,

the laser field and the fluctuations in the non-lasing mode. For high laser
fields, this coupling splits the spectrum of the non-lasing mode into a triplet
consisting of two relaxation oscillation sidebands which are in phase with the
laser light and a center line at the lasing frequency with a phase shift of pi
half relative to the laser light. As the laser intensity is increased close to
threshold, the spectrum shows a continuous transition from the single amplified
spontaneous emission line at the frequency of the laser mode to the triplet
structure. An analytical expression for this transition is derived and typical
