  Crusts of Neutron Stars","15 pages, 4 figures, AASTEX",,,"AST-1-98","astro-ph",,"  We consider magnetic field evolution of neutron stars during polar-cap
accretion. The size of the polar cap increases as the field decays, and is set
by the last open field line before the accretion disk. Below the polar cap we
find the temperature to be so high that electron-phonon scattering dominates
the resistivity. Outside the polar cap region, the temperature is such the
resistivity is dominated by temperature independent impurity scattering which
can be a few orders of magnitude larger than the electron- phonon resistivity.
The time-scale for field decay is therefore initially given by impurity
scattering dominated resistivity. When the field strength has been reduced to
$\sim 10^8 gauss$ the accretion is spherical and the time scale for field decay
is given by the smaller electron-phonon scattering resistivity. The field
strength is now reduced rapidly compared to before and this could be a reason
for there being no pulsars known with field strengths below $10^8 gauss$. We
also investigate the evolution of multipoles at the neutron star surface. We
find that contribution from higher-order multipoles are at most 30% to that of
the dipole mode.

fluctuations are observed, that obey power-law density distributions and
correlation functions.
  These structures are hierarchical, chaotic, turbulent, but are also
self-organizing. The apparent disorder is not random noise, but can be
described by a fractal, with a deterministic fractal dimension. We discuss the
theories advanced to describe these fractal structures, and in particular a new
theory of the self-gravity thermodynamics, that could explain their existence,
and predict their fractal dimension. The media obeying scaling laws can be
considered critical, as in second order phase transitions for instance.

Hamiltonian of the system consists of a potential (diagonal) term and a - small
- off-diagonal matrix containing typically quantum effects, such as a hopping
matrix, we show that the latter creates an effective interaction between the
particles.
  In the case that the potential matrix has infinitely many degenerate ground
states, some of them may be stabilized by the effective potential. The low
temperature phase diagram is thus a small deformation of the zero temperature
phase diagram of the diagonal potential and the effective potential. As
illustrations we discuss the asymmetric Hubbard model and the hard-core
Bose-Hubbard model.

from the two-flavour fully packed loop model on the square lattice. This loop
model exhibits a two-dimensional manifold of critical fixed points each one
characterised by an infinite set of geometrical scaling dimensions. We
calculate these dimensions exactly by mapping the loop model to an interface
model whose scaling limit is described by a Liouville field theory. The
formulae for the central charge and the first few scaling dimensions are
compared to numerical transfer matrix results and excellent agreement is found.
Compact polymers are identified with a particular point in the phase diagram of
the loop model, and the non-mean field value of the conformational exponent
\gamma = 117/112 is calculated for the first time. Interacting compact polymers
are described by a line of fixed points along which \gamma varies continuously.

transport relaxation time increases monotonously with $P$. The magnetoexciton
mean free path $\lambda (P)$ has a maximum at $P\ne 0$ in the cases (i), (iii).
It decreases with increasing $D/l$. The mean free path calculated for the case
(ii) may have two maxima. One of them disappears with the variation of the
random fields parameters. The maximum of $\lambda (P)$ increases with $H$ for
types (i,iii) of scattering processes and decreases in the case (ii).
