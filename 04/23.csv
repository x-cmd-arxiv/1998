correspond to, respectively, a count rate of 1,600 cps and 4,500 cps in the
nominal 2-60 keV RXTE-PCA band. Its energy spectral state was observed to
encompass both the banana branches and the island state. Kilohertz QPOs were
observed to exist in the upper-banana and lower-banana branches, as well as in
the island state. In particular, we report that the kHz QPOs were present only
when the soft-color (defined as the flux ratio of the 3.9-5.0 keV band to the

without regard to whether the source is in any one of the three branches or

rate below 2,500 cps. When the count rate was above 2,500 cps, the QPO
frequency was consistent with a constant independent of the overall count rate.
We take this as further evidence that the inner edge of the accretion had
reached the marginally stable orbit, and therefore the constant 1060 +/- 20 Hz

been carried out using archival MACHO data. When a barely resolved red field
star is accounted for, there is no (V-R)-color variation, even through eclipse.
There have been substantial changes in the depth of minimum light since 1988;
it has decreased more than 0.5 mag in the last several years. The spectral
features and radial velocities are also found to vary not only through the
0.44-day orbit but also over timescales of a year or more. Possible
interpretations of these long-term changes are discussed. The 1996 spectra
contain phase-modulated Balmer absorption lines not previously seen, apparently
arising in gas flowing from the region of the compact star. The changes in
emission-line strengths with orbital phase indicate there are azimuthal
variations in the accretion disk structures. Radial velocities of several lines
give different amplitudes and phasing, making determination of the stellar
masses difficult. All solutions for the stellar masses indicate that the
companion star is considerably less massive than the degenerate star. The
Balmer absorption-line velocities correspond to masses of ~1.4Msun for the
degenerate star and ~0.4Msun for the mass donor. However, the strong He II
emission lines indicate a much more massive accreting star, with Mx>4Msun.

the Machos that have been detected reside in the Halo of our Galaxy, then a
simple extrapolation of the Galactic population (out to 50 kpc) of Machos to
cosmic scales gives a cosmic density $\rho_{Macho} = (1-5) \times 10^9 h \msun
\Mpc^{-3}$, which in terms of the critical density corresponds to
$\Omega_{Macho}=(0.0036-0.017) h^{-1}$. Such a mass density is comparable to
the baryon density implied by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. If we take the central
values of the estimates, then Machos dominate the baryonic content of the
Universe today, with $\Omega_{Macho}/\Omega_{Baryon} \sim 0.7 h$. However, the
cumulative uncertainties in the density determinations only require that
$\Omega_{Macho}/\Omega_{Baryon} \geq 1/6 h f_{gal}$, where the fraction of
galaxies that contain Machos $f_{gal} > 0.17$, and $h$ is the Hubble constant
in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Our best estimate for $\Omega_{Macho}$
is hard to reconcile with the current best estimates of the baryonic content of
the intergalactic medium indicated by measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest. We explore the addition constraints that arise if the Machos are white
dwarfs as suggested by the present microlensing data. We discuss the challenges
this scenario presents at both the local and cosmic scales, emphasizing in
particular the constraints on the required mass budget and nucleosynthesis
products (particularly carbon).

used to estimate the sampling, noise and aliasing errors on the measured power
spectrum. For this case we describe a minimum variance inversion procedure from
the 2-d to 3-d power spectrum and discuss a sparse sampling strategy which
optimizes the signal to noise on the power spectrum. On degree scales and
smaller the shear and convergence statistics lie in the nonlinear regime and
have a non-gaussian distribution. For this regime ray tracing simulations are
useful to provide reliable error estimates and calibration of the measurements.
We show how the skewness and kurtosis can in principle be used to probe the
mean density in the universe, but are sensitive to sampling errors and require
large observed areas. The probability distribution function is likely to be
more useful as a tool to investigate nonlinear effects. In particular, it shows
striking differences between models with different values of the mean density

the correlations between line-strength indices and the cooling flow phenomenon

presence and characteristics of emission lines in the inner regions of the
CCGs. CCGs in cooling flow clusters exhibit a clear sequence in the D4000-Mg2
plane, with a neat segregation depending on emission-line types and blue
morphology. This sequence can be modelled, using stellar population models with
a normal IMF, by a recent burst of star formation. In CCGs with emission lines,
the gradients in the spectral indices are flat or positive inside the
emission-line regions, suggesting the presence of young stars. Outside the
emission-line regions, and in cooling flow galaxies without emission lines,
gradients are negative and consistent with those measured in CCGs in clusters
without cooling flows and giant elliptical galaxies. Index gradients measured
exclusively in the emission-line region correlate with mass deposition rate. We
have also estimated the radial profiles of the mass transformed into new stars
which are remarkably parallel to the radial behaviour of the mass deposition
rate. A large fraction (probably most) of the cooling flow gas accreted into
the emission-line region is converted into stars. We discuss the evolutionary
sequence suggested by McNamara (1997), in which radio triggered star formation

pulsar magnetospheres is wrong and misleading. The key point is that usually
the direction of a gamma photon at the emission point observed in the
laboratory frame should be (v/c, 0, [1-(v/c)^2]^{1/2}) rather than (0, 0, 1),
where v is the co-rotating velocity. This emission direction is just the one
which results in zero attenuation coefficient of the gamma photon. Calculation
shows that after the photon has moved a distance, its direction lead to the
result that the induced electric field is also of minor importance. Thus only
gamma-B process is the important mechanism for the pair production in the
pulsar magnetospheres. The implications of the modification by ejecting the
induced electric field are also discussed.

more particularly the relative numbers of dwarfs to giants, appears to be very
similar for clusters of similar morphology, but may vary between cluster types.
We have previously suggested that dwarfs may be more common in less compact,
spiral rich clusters. Similarly we have found evidence for population gradients
across clusters, in that the dwarf population appears more spatially extended.
In the present paper we summarise the current evidence and propose, in analogy
to the well-known morphology - density relation, that what we are seeing is a
dwarf population - density relation; dwarfs are more common in lower density
environments. Finally we discuss recent semi-analytic models of galaxy
formation in the hierarchical clustering picture, which may give clues as to
the origin of our proposed relation.

system with mass M_Y< 1.6 GeV and where the squared momentum transfer at the pY
vertex, t, is limited to |t|<1 GeV^2, is studied as a function of the invariant
mass M_X of the system X. Results are presented on multiplicity distributions
and multiplicity moments, rapidity spectra and forward-backward correlations in
the centre-of-mass system of X. The data are compared to results in e+e-
annihilation, fixed-target lepton-nucleon collisions, hadro-produced
diffractive final states and to non-diffractive hadron-hadron collisions. The
comparison suggests a production mechanism of virtual photon dissociation which
involves a mixture of partonic states and a significant gluon content. The data
are well described by a model, based on a QCD-Regge analysis of the diffractive
structure function, which assumes a large hard gluonic component of the
colourless exchange at low Q^2. A model with soft colour interactions is also
successful.

for photoproduction events in which the hadronic final state containing the
jets is separated with respect to the outgoing proton direction by a large
rapidity gap. The cross section has been measured as a function of the fraction
of the photon (x_gamma^OBS) and pomeron (beta^OBS) momentum participating in
the production of the dijet system. The observed x_gamma^OBS dependence shows
evidence for the presence of a resolved- as well as a direct-photon component.
The measured cross section d(sigma)/d(beta^OBS) increases as beta^OBS increases
indicating that there is a sizeable contribution to dijet production from those
events in which a large fraction of the pomeron momentum participates in the
hard scattering. These cross sections and the ZEUS measurements of the
diffractive structure function can be described by calculations based on parton
densities in the pomeron which evolve according to the QCD evolution equations
and include a substantial hard momentum component of gluons in the pomeron.

decay laws, and the quantum Lax-Phillips theory of scattering and unstable
systems. In this framework, the decay of an unstable system is described by a
semigroup.
  The spectrum of the generator of the semigroup corresponds to the
singularities of the Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix. In the case of discrete (complex)
spectrum of the generator of the semigroup, associated with resonances, the
decay law is exactly exponential. The states corresponding to these resonances
(eigenfunctions of the generator of the semigroup) lie in the Lax-Phillips
Hilbert space, and therefore all physical properties of the resonant states can
be computed. We show that the parametrized relativistic quantum theory is a
natural setting for the realization of the Lax-Phillips theory.

groupoids are used in the construction of the free associative category. They
are also used in the construction of the theory of associative categories

homomorphisms $\pi(P_n):\pi(\An) \longrightarrow \pi(\bf B_n)$. If the images

deg(X)-codimension(X)+1. Generic projection methods proved to be effective for
the study of regularity of smooth projevtive varieties of dimension at most
four(cf.[BM},[K2],[L],[Pi] and [R1]) because there are nice vanishing theorems

theorem) and detailed information about the fibers ofgeneric projections from X
to a hypersurface of the same dimension. Here we show by using methods similar

smooth fivefold and $\reg{X}\le(deg(X)-codimension(X)+1)+20$ for any smooth
sixfold.
  Furthermore, using similar methods we give a bound for the regularity of an
arbitrary (not necessarily locally Cohen-Macaulay) projective surface X in P^N.
To wit, we show that $\reg{X}\le(d-e+1)d-(2e+1)$, where d=deg(X) and
e=codimension(X). This is the first bound for surfaces which does not depend on

experimental results at medium to high momentum transfers. On the other hand,

model is examined in detail. It is found that the force can be expressed as the
sum of a monotonically decaying function of position and of an oscillatory
piece. At large separations, the oscillatory piece is the dominant
contribution, and is much larger than the Casimir-Polder interaction that
arises in the limit that the sphere is a perfect conductor. It is argued that
this enhancement of the force can be interpreted in terms of the frequency
spectrum of vacuum fluctuations. In the limit of a perfectly conducting sphere,
there are cancellations between different parts of the spectrum which no longer
occur as completely in the case of a sphere with frequency dependent
polarizability. Estimates of the magnitude of the oscillatory component of the
force suggest that it may be large enough to be observable.

Phys","Annals Phys.270:178-197,1998","10.1006/aphy.1998.5850",,"quant-ph",,"  We obtain the adiabatic Berry phase by defining a generalised gauge potential
whose line integral gives the phase holonomy for arbitrary evolutions of
parameters. Keeping in mind that for classical integrable systems it is hardly
clear how to obtain open-path Hannay angle, we establish a connection between
the open-path Berry phase and Hannay angle by using the parametrised coherent
state approach. Using the semiclassical wavefunction we analyse the open-path
Berry phase and obtain the open-path Hannay angle. Further, by expressing the
adiabatic Berry phase in terms of the commutator of instantaneous projectors
with its differential and using Wigner representation of operators we obtain
the Poisson bracket between distribution function and its differential. This
enables us to talk about the classical limit of the phase holonomy which yields
the angle holonomy for open-paths. An operational definition of Hannay angle is
provided based on the idea of classical limit of quantum mechanical inner
product. A probable application of the open-path Berry phase and Hannay angle
to wave-packet revival phenomena is also pointed out.

wave accompanying absorption: a ""quantum silhouette"" of the absorber.
Accordingly, the process is not free of interaction. For a perfect absorber the
forward-scattered wave is locked both in amplitude and in phase. For an
imperfect one it has a nontrivial phase of dynamical origin (``colored
silhouette""), measurable by interferometry. Other examples of quantum
silhouettes, all controlled by unitarity, are briefly discussed.
