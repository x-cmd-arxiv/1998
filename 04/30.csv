treatment of Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) temperature anisotropies arising
from inhomogeneities in the early universe. This paper deals with algebraic
issues, both generically and in the context of models linearised about RW
geometries.
  The approach represents radiation anisotropies by PSTF tensors. The Angular
correlation functions for the mode coefficients are found in terms of these
quantities, following the Wilson-Silk approach, but derived and dealt with in
CGI form. The covariant multipole and mode-expanded angular correlation
functions are related to the usual treatments in the literature. The CGI mode
expansion is related to the coordinate approach by linking the Legendre
functions to the PSTF representation, using a covariant addition theorem for
the tensors to generate the Legendre Polynomial recursion relation.
  This paper lays the foundation for further papers in the series, which use
this formalism in a CGI approach to develop solutions of the Boltzmann and
Liouville equations for the CBR before and after decoupling, thus providing a
unified CGI derivation of the variety of approaches to CBR anisotropies in the
current literature.

  Journal","Astrophys.J.501:554,1998","10.1086/305838",,"astro-ph",,"  The bimodal globular cluster (GC) metallicity distributions of many giant
elliptical galaxies are often cited as evidence for the formation of such
galaxies through mergers involving gas-rich spirals. In such models, the metal-
rich GCs are assumed to have formed during the merger process. We explore an
alternative possibility: that these metal-rich clusters represent the galaxy's
intrinsic GC population and that the metal-poor component of the observed GC
metallicity distribution arises from the capture of GCs from other galaxies,
either through mergers or through tidal stripping. Starting with plausible
assumptions for the initial galaxy luminosity function and for the dependence
of GC metallicity on parent galaxy luminosity, we show that the growth of a
pre-existing seed galaxy through mergers and tidal stripping is accompanied by
the capture of metal-poor GCs whose properties are similar to those which are
observed to surround giant ellipticals. We describe a method of using the
observed number of metal-poor and metal-rich GCs to infer the merger histories
of individual elliptical galaxies, and use this technique to derive limits on
the number of galaxies and total luminosity accreted to date by M49. We argue
that although GC specific frequency is conserved in galaxy mergers, the same
may not be true of tidal stripping by the mean field of the host galaxy
cluster. Comparisons of model GC metallicity distributions and specific
frequencies to those observed for the well-studied galaxies M49 and M87 show
that it is possible to explain their bimodal GC metallicity distributions and
discordant specific frequencies without resorting to the formation of new GCs
in mergers or by invoking multiple bursts of GC formation.

the rapidly accreting and weakly magnetic neutron stars in the Galaxy are
rotating at spin frequencies greater than 250 Hz. Remarkably, they all rotate
in a narrow range of frequencies. I suggest that these stars rotate fast enough
so that, on average, the angular momentum added by accretion is lost to
gravitational radiation. The strong spin frequency dependence of the angular
momentum loss rate from gravitational radiation then provides a natural reason
for similar spin frequencies. Provided that the interior temperature has a
large scale asymmetry misaligned from the spin axis, then the temperature
sensitive electron captures in the deep crust can provide the quadrupole needed
to reach this limiting situation at 300 Hz. This quadrupole is only present
during accretion and makes it difficult to form radio pulsars spinning more
rapidly than 600-800 Hz via rapid accretion. The gravity wave strength is
<10^{-26} from most neutron stars and >2 X 10^{-26} for Sco X-1. Prior
knowledge of the position, spin frequency and orbital periods will allow for
deep searches for these periodic signals with gravitational wave
interferometers (LIGO, VIRGO and the dual-recycled GEO 600 detector) and

the lower accretion rate in LINERs and LLAGN which is probably causing the
accretion flow to be advection-dominated. This results in a larger
characteristic size for the X-ray producing region than is the case in
``normal'' AGN. Short-term variability may be caused by a localized instability
or occultation events, but we note that such events would likely be accompanied
by broad-band spectral changes. Since the ADAF is more compact in a Kerr
metric, it is possible that the X-ray emission from ADAFs around rotating
blackholes would be more variable than X-ray emission from ADAFs in a
Schwarzchild metric. Similar variability arguments also apply to other

scattering medium the correlation function consists of three terms. However,
the structure of the terms is rather different. Angular correlation has a
power-law decay and exhibits oscillations. There is no ""memory effect"" as in
the case of an elastic medium. Interaction between diffusion modes is strongly
enhanced near the lasing threshold. Frequency correlation scale decreases close
to the lasing threshold.
  We also consider time correlations of the transmission in the case of
nonstationary inhomogeneities. We find short- and long-range time correlations.
The scale of the short-range correlation decreases, while the long-range
correlation scale becomes infinite near the threshold.

chemical reaction barrier of H+H$_2\longrightarrow $H$_2$+H. At low
temperature, good agreement is obtained with ground state calculations. We
studied the proton-proton interaction in an electron gas as a simple model for
hydrogen impurities in metals. We calculated the force between the two protons
at two electronic densities corresponding to Na ($r_s=3.93$) and Al
($r_s=2.07$) using a supercell with 38 electrons. The result is compared to
previous calculations. We also studied the effect of temperature on the
proton-proton interaction. At very high temperature, our result agrees with the
Debye screening of electrons. As temperature decreases, the Debye theory fails
both because of the strong degeneracy of electrons and most importantly, the
formation of electronic bound states around the protons.

studying the critical points of the energy function. We study in detail the

investigations of the Lee-Yang zeros of the partition function in the complex
fermion mass plane. For strong gauge coupling ($\beta < 1$) the critical
exponents for the chiral phase transition are determined. We find strong
indications that the chiral phase transition is in one universality class in
this $\beta$ interval: that of the three-dimensional Gross-Neveu model with two
fermions. Thus the continuum limit of the $\chiU\phi_3$ model defines here a
nonperturbatively renormalizable gauge theory with dynamical mass generation.
At weak gauge coupling and small $\kappa$, we explore a region in which the
mass in the neutral fermion channel is large but the chiral condensate on

non-perturbative physics in a description of the heterotic string infinitely
far down the throat. Our guide is a D1-brane probing N D5-branes in type I,

the hypermultiplet moduli space of the theory flows to an exact conformal field

non-perturbative symmetry is indeed found in the conformal field theory,
lurking in the structure of the partition function, and encoded in a family of
deformations of the theory along flat directions. The deformations have an
explicit description using the flow from the type I theory, and have a

  We discuss the relation of the generalized polarizabilities of virtual
Compton scattering to the polarizabilities of real Compton scattering.

external magnetic fields is investigated. The magnetic field is adjusted so as
to compensate for the gravitational force acting on ground-state atoms. The
dark state (DS) is created and supported in momentum space with additional
velocity-selective two-photon transitions. The minimum allowed temperature is
found to be determined only by the width of velocity selection and therefore
can be much less than the gravitational limit. A complete set of analytical
formulas describing cooling of a dilute atomic sample is derived. They serve as
the basis for numerical simulations which are carried out in the
one-dimensional (1D) case.

Microstrip Gas Chambers (MSGC) with a total number of 147 456 electronic read
out channels. The detectors have to cope with particle fluxes up to 25
kHz/mm**2 and to tolerate radiation doses of 1 Mrad per year. During the
development of these chambers it was found that conventional MSGC, operated in
intenses hadronic fluxes, are rapidly destroyed due to induced discharges. The
introduction of a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) as pre-amplification structure
offers the possibility to build robust and reliable detectors allowing for
ample gain reserve in the hostile environment of HERA-B.

crossings are formed when a chaotic singlet intersects a tunnel doublet. We
study the dissipative quantum dynamics in the vicinity of such crossings. A
harmonically driven double well coupled to a bath serves as a model. Markov and
rotating-wave approximations are introduced with respect to the Floquet
spectrum of the time-dependent central system. The resulting master equation is
integrated numerically. We find various types of transient tunneling,
determined by the relation of the level width to the inherent energy scales of
the crossing. The decay of coherent tunneling can be significantly retarded or
accelerated. Modifications of the quantum asymptotic state by the crossing are
also studied. The comparison with a simple three-state model shows that in
contrast to the undamped case, the participation of states outside the crossing
cannot be neglected in the presence of dissipation.

trajectories that are determined by the full solution of the time dependent

that this is the case indeed.

We show that in the hydrogen atom such wave packets do not move

Keplerian orbits of the classical electron. The poor quantum-classical
correspondence does not improve in the semiclassical limit.
