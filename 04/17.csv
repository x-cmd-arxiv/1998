GHz) indicate that a region of enhanced scattering is along the line of sight
to the Galactic center. We combine radio-wave scattering data and free-free
emission and absorption measurements in a likelihood analysis that constrains
the following parameters of the GC scattering region: The GC-scattering region
separation, d; the angular extent of the region, \psi_l; the outer scale on
which density fluctuations occur, l_0; and the gas temperature, T. The maximum
likelihood estimates of these parameters are d = 133_{-80}^{+200} pc, 0.5
degrees <= \psi_l <~ 1 degrees, and (l_0/1 pc)^{2/3}T^{-1/2} = 10^{-7 +/- 0.8}.
As host media for the scattering, we consider the photoionized surface layers
of molecular clouds and the interfaces between molecular clouds and the 10^7 K
ambient gas. We are unable to make an unambiguous determination, but we favor
an interface model in which the scattering medium is hot (T ~ 10^6 K) and dense
(n_e ~ 10 cm^{-3}). The GC scattering region produces a 1 GHz scattering
diameter for an extragalactic source of 90"", if the region is a single screen,
or 180"", if the region wraps around the GC, as appears probable. We modify the
Taylor-Cordes model for the Galactic distribution of free electrons in order to
include an explicit GC component. Pulsars seen through this region will have a
dispersion measure of approximately 2000 pc cm^{-3}, of which 75% arises from
the GC component. We stress the uniqueness of the GC scattering region,
probably resulting from the high-pressure environment in the GC.

Hubble-profiles) and with `cusps' (generalized Navarro et al., or NFW, and de
Vaucouleurs profiles). We use the Likelihood ratio to investigate whether the
observations are better described by profiles with cusps or with cores. Taking
the King and NFW profiles as model of either class, we find that about 75% of
the clusters are better fitted by the King profile than by the NFW profile.
However, for the individual clusters the preference for the King profile is
rarely significant. When we limit ourselves to the central regions it appears
that the significance increases drastically, with 65% of the clusters showing a
strong preference for a King over an NFW profile. We constructed composite
clusters from the COSMOS and ENACS data, taking special care to avoid the
creation or the destruction of cusps. We scale by different ways (projected
distances, core radii, r_{200}).In all three cases we find that the King
profile is clearly preferred over the NFW profile. However, this preference is
not shared by the brightest galaxies. We conclude that these galaxies are
represented almost equally well by King and NFWprofiles, but that the
distribution of the fainter galaxies clearly shows a core rather than a cusp.
Finally, we compared the outer slope of the galaxy distributions in ourclusters
with results for model calculations with different cosmological parameters. We
conclude that the observed profile slope indicates a low value for Omega_0.
This is consistent with the direct estimate of Omega_0 based on the M/L ratios

coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. Our model
predicts the existence of an ``ordered phase'' of flocks, in which all members
of the flock move together with the same mean velocity. This coherent motion of
the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry. The ``Goldstone
modes'' associated with this ``spontaneously broken rotational symmetry'' are
fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from
the mean direction. These ``Goldstone modes'' mix with modes associated with
conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound
modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock. Our model is
similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible
fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time dependent
Ginsburg-Landau theory for an $n = d$ component isotropic ferromagnet. In
spatial dimensions $d > 4$, the long distance behavior is correctly described
by a linearized theory. For $d < 4$, non-linear fluctuation effects radically
alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known
equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in $d = 2$, where we can
calculate the scaling exponents \underline{exactly}, flocks exhibit a true,
long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to
equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in
$d = 2$ (the ``Mermin-Wagner'' theorem). We make detailed predictions for

interaction of inclusions of equal orientation is repulsive at all distances
between them, while the inclusions of opposite orientation repel each other at
small separations, but attract each other at larger ones. Both the repulsive
and attractive forces become stronger with increasing lateral tension. This is
different from what has been predicted on the basis of the same static model

given by the $\bar{SL}(3,R)$ ""little"" group is determined. The manifields are

to be small, and hence microscopic abelian dominance on the link variable is
observed in the lattice QCD for the whole region of $\beta$. From the
gluon-propagator analysis in the lattice QCD, the origin of abelian dominance
for the long-range physics is interpreted as the effective mass $m_{ch} \simeq
0.9 {\rm GeV}$ of the charged gluon induced by the MA gauge fixing. In the MA
gauge, there appears the macroscopic network of the monopole world-line
covering the whole system, which would be identified as monopole condensation
at a large scale. Using the dual Wilson loop in the MA gauge, we find the
effective mass of the dual gluon field, $m_B \simeq $0.5GeV, which is the
evidence of the dual Higgs mechanism by monopole condensation. The large
fluctuation of off-diagonal gluons remains around the monopole in the MA gauge,
and this charged-gluon rich region would provide the effective monopole size as
the critical scale of the abelian projected QCD. Instantons are expected to
appear in the charged-gluon rich region around the monopole world-line in the
MA gauge, which leads to the local correlation between monopoles and
instantons.

dimensional regularization was designed to regulate Coulomb-gauge Feynman
integrals in non-Abelian theories. The technique which is based on two complex
regulating parameters, $\omega$ and $\sigma$, is shown to generate a
well-defined set of Coulomb-gauge integrals. A major component of this project
deals with the evaluation of four-propagator and five-propagator Coulomb
integrals, some of which are nonlocal. It is further argued that the standard
one-loop BRST identity relating $\Sigma$ and $\Lambda_\mu$, should by rights be
replaced by a more general BRST identity which contains two additional
contributions from ghost vertex diagrams. Despite the appearance of nonlocal
Coulomb integrals, both $\Sigma$ and $\Lambda_\mu$ are local functions which
satisfy the appropriate BRST identity. Application of split dimensional
regularization to two-loop energy integrals is briefly discussed.

states in N=2 theory and find the particle correspondence under duality. In the
process, we also find some exotic particles in N=2 MQCD, and we observe an
interesting phenomenon in type IIA string theory, namely, that fundamental
strings are converted into D2-branes via the exchange of two NS5-branes. We

physical examples, where the determinant of a product of differential operators
is not equal to the product of the corresponding functional determinants. The
simplicity of the Hamiltonian operators chosen is aimed at showing that such
