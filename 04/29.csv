of the core a Hubble time ago? A scenario that Sgr was deflected to its current
orbit by the Magellanic Clouds after a rendezvous on the north Galactic pole
2-3 Gyrs ago is examined. It is shown that the conditions of the collision fix
both the sense of circulation of Sgr and the LMC around the Galaxy and the
slope of the Galactic rotation curve. The model argues that the two orthogonal
polar circles traced by a dozen or so Galactic halo dwarf galaxies and globular
clusters (LMC-SMC-Magellanic Stream-Draco-Ursa Minor along $l \approx 270^o$

envelopes. In these stars, the radiative layer contributes to mode damping
because its opacity decreases upon compression and the amplitude of the
Lagrangian pressure perturbation increases outward. The overlying convective
envelope is the seat of mode excitation because it acts as an insulating
blanket with respect to the perturbed flux that enters it from below. A crucial
point is that the convective motions respond to the instantaneous pulsational
state. Driving exceeds damping by as much as a factor of two provided
$\omega\tau_c\geq 1$, where $\omega$ is the radian frequency of the mode and
$\tau_c\approx 4\tau_{th}$ with $\tau_{th}$ being the thermal time constant
evaluated at the base of the convective envelope. As a white dwarf cools, its
convection zone deepens, and modes of lower frequency become overstable.
However, the deeper convection zone impedes the passage of flux perturbations
from the base of the convection zone to the photosphere. Thus the photometric
variation of a mode with constant velocity amplitude decreases. These factors
account for the observed trend that longer period modes are found in cooler
DAVs. The linear growth time, ranging from hours for the longest period
observed modes ($P\approx 20$ minutes) to thousands of years for those of
shortest period ($P\approx 2 $ minutes), probably sets the time-scale for
variations of mode amplitude and phase. This is consistent with observations
showing that longer period modes are more variable than shorter period ones.
Our investigation confirms many results obtained by Brickhill in his pioneering
studies of ZZ Cetis.

gamma-ray deposition following the radioactive decay of 56Ni. We examine this

generate the observed line owing to the confinement of the 56Ni to the central

introduce additional upward mixing of the 56Ni, with 10^{-5} of the total

with a face-on surface covering factor 15%. The kinetic temperature of the CNM
increases systematically with galactocentric radius, from some 50 to 200 K, as
expected for a radially declining thermal pressure in the galaxy mid-plane.
Galaxies of different Hubble type form a nested distribution in T_K(R),
apparently due to the mean differences in pressure which result from the
different stellar and gas surface densities. The opaque CNM disappears abruptly
near R_25, where the low thermal pressure can no longer support the condensed
atomic phase. The CNM is apparently a prerequisite for star formation. Median
line profiles of the CNM display an extremely narrow line core (FWHM about 6
km/s) together with broad Lorentzian wings (FWHM about 30 km/s). The line core
is consistent with only opacity broadening of a thermal profile. The spatial
distribution of CNM linewidths is not random. High linewidths occur in distinct
shell-like structures with diameter of 100's of pc to kpc's, which show some
correlation with diffuse H-alpha shells. The primary source of ``turbulent''
linewidth in the atomic ISM appears to be organized motions due to localized
energy injection on a scale of a few 100 pc.

disambiguation'', is expected to improve the analytical accuracy for tasks
which are sensitive to lexical semantics. Such tasks include machine
translation, information retrieval, parsing, natural language understanding and
lexicography. Reflecting the growth in utilization of machine readable texts,
word sense disambiguation techniques have been explored variously in the
context of corpus-based approaches. Within one corpus-based framework, that is
the similarity-based method, systems use a database, in which example sentences
are manually annotated with correct word senses. Given an input, systems search
the database for the most similar example to the input. The lexical ambiguity
of a word contained in the input is resolved by selecting the sense annotation
of the retrieved example. In this research, we apply this method of resolution
of verbal polysemy, in which the similarity between two examples is computed as
the weighted average of the similarity between complements governed by a target
polysemous verb. We explore similarity-based verb sense disambiguation focusing
on the following three methods. First, we propose a weighting schema for each
verb complement in the similarity computation. Second, in similarity-based
techniques, the overhead for manual supervision and searching the large-sized
database can be prohibitive. To resolve this problem, we propose a method to
select a small number of effective examples, for system usage. Finally, the
efficiency of our system is highly dependent on the similarity computation
used. To maximize efficiency, we propose a method which integrates the
advantages of previous methods for similarity computation.

associated with the successive formation of chain folds. However, in the early

momentum-dependent ``diamagnetic'' effective (mass)^2 due to confinement
effects and a negative one due to ``paramagnetic'' spin-spin interactions which
are related to the <F^2>=0 instability. Numerical evaluation of an approximate

of the first-order phase transition with increasing Higgs mass which was
observed in lattice calculations. The crossover point can be roughly determined
postulating that the effective \phi^4 and \phi^2 terms vanish there.

operators, where the parameter space may now be a cone $\Gamma\subset\R^p$, we
construct a unique ``symbol valued trace'', which extends the $L^2$-trace on
operators of small order. This allows to construct various trace functionals in
a systematic way. Furthermore we study the higher-dimensional eta-invariants on
algebras with parameter space $\R^{2k-1}$. Using Clifford representations we
construct for each first order elliptic differential operator a natural family
of parametric pseudodifferential operators over $\R^{2k-1}$. The eta-invariant
of this family coincides with the spectral eta-invariant of the operator.

growth of concentration fluctuations starting from premixed initial conditions
was analyzed using Fourier techniques. In one mixture, we observed generally
merging dynamics in the segregated bands up to the onset of saturation. At the
threshold of saturation, we found a spectrum of wavelengths with a broad peak.
The peak position was nearly independent of the tube rotation rate. The overall
growth rate of Fourier modes had a maximum at a particular value of the angular
rotation frequency. In a slightly different mixture, we observed transient
traveling waves when the larger grains were in the majority. We measured the
wave speed as a function of several parameters using presegregated initial
conditions to launch waves of various wavelengths.

say that x_i is an \epsilon-approximate median if the number of elements
strictly less than x_i, and the number of elements strictly greater than x_i
are each less than (1+\epsilon)n/2. We consider the quantum query complexity of
computing an \epsilon-approximate median, given the sequence X as an oracle. We
prove a lower bound of \Omega(\min{{1/\epsilon},n}) queries for any quantum
algorithm that computes an \epsilon-approximate median with any constant
probability greater than 1/2. We also show how an \epsilon-approximate median
may be computed with O({1/\epsilon}\log({1\/\epsilon}) \log\log({1/\epsilon}))
oracle queries, which represents an improvement over an earlier algorithm due
to Grover. Thus, the lower bound we obtain is essentially optimal. The upper
and the lower bound both hold in the comparison tree model as well.
  Our lower bound result is an application of the polynomial paradigm recently
introduced to quantum complexity theory by Beals et al. The main ingredient in
the proof is a polynomial degree lower bound for real multilinear polynomials
that ``approximate'' symmetric partial boolean functions. The degree bound
extends a result of Paturi and also immediately yields lower bounds for the
problems of approximating the kth-smallest element, approximating the mean of a
sequence of numbers, and that of approximately counting the number of ones of a
boolean function. All bounds obtained come within polylogarithmic factors of
the optimal (as we show by presenting algorithms where no such optimal or near
optimal algorithms were known), thus demonstrating the power of the polynomial
method.
