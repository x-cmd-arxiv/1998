7052, which has a nuclear disk of dust and gas. The WFPC2 was used to obtain B,
V and I broad-band images and an H_alpha+[NII] narrow-band image. The FOS was
used to obtain H_alpha+[NII] spectra along the major axis, using a 0.26 arcsec
diameter circular aperture. The observed rotation velocity of the ionized gas
is V = 155 +/- 17 km/s at r = 0.2 arcsec from the nucleus. The Gaussian
dispersion of the emission lines increases from sigma = 70 km/s at r=1 arcsec,
to sigma = 400 km/s on the nucleus.
  To interpret the gas kinematics we construct axisymmetric models in which the
gas and dust reside in a disk in the equatorial plane of the stellar body. It
is assumed that the gas moves on circular orbits, with an intrinsic velocity
dispersion due to turbulence. The circular velocity is calculated from the
combined gravitational potential of the stars and a possible nuclear black hole
(BH). Models without a BH predict a rotation curve that is shallower than
observed (V_pred = 92 km/s at r = 0.2 arcsec), and are ruled out at > 99%
confidence. Models with a BH of 3.3^{+2.3}_{-1.3} x 10^8 solar masses provide
an acceptable fit.
  NGC 7052 can be added to the list of active galaxies for which HST spectra of
a nuclear gas disk provide evidence for the presence of a central BH. The BH
masses inferred for M87, M84, NGC 6251, NGC 4261 and NGC 7052 span a range of a
factor 10, with NGC 7052 falling on the low end. By contrast, the luminosities
of these galaxies are identical to within 25%. Any relation between BH mass and

foreground Galactic dwarf stars against a backdrop of faint blue field
galaxies, while the M31 halo field contains a clear excess of faint red objects
(I~20-23, B-I~2-3.5) in addition to these two components. The CMD location of
this population of faint red objects is as would be expected for RGB stars at
the distance of M31. The surface density of RGB candidates in the R=19 kpc M31

indicate that M31's stellar halo is much denser/larger than that of the Galaxy:

(i.e. after correcting for the effect of the psf) half-light radii of ~0.1

X-ray colors are consistent with those derived from the bulges of the spiral

therefore suggest that the bulk of the X-ray emission in the faintest

galaxies had been found to be described by a hard component which was
attributed to LMXB emission, and a very soft component of unknown origin. We

bracket obtained is not of the canonical type. Specifically, we give two
examples that give rise to brackets of the noncanonical Lie-Poisson form: the
rigid body and the two-dimensional ideal fluid. From these simple cases, we
then use the semidirect product extension of algebras to describe more complex
physical systems. The Casimir invariants in these systems are examined, and
some are shown to be linked to the recovery of information about the

semidirect product, namely compressible reduced MHD, and find for this case
that the Casimir invariants lend partial information about the configuration of
the system.

Weinstein","Time Dependent Resonance Theory","to appear in Geometrical and Functional Analysis",,,,"chao-dyn math.AP math.SP nlin.CD physics.atom-ph physics.chem-ph quant-ph",,"  An important class of resonance problems involves the study of perturbations
of systems having embedded eigenvalues in their continuous spectrum. Problems
with this mathematical structure arise in the study of many physical systems,
e.g. the coupling of an atom or molecule to a photon-radiation field, and Auger
states of the helium atom, as well as in spectral geometry and number theory.
We present a dynamic (time-dependent) theory of such quantum resonances. The
key hypotheses are (i) a resonance condition which holds generically
(non-vanishing of the {\it Fermi golden rule}) and (ii) local decay estimates
for the unperturbed dynamics with initial data consisting of continuum modes
associated with an interval containing the embedded eigenvalue of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian. No assumption of dilation analyticity of the potential
is made. Our method explicitly demonstrates the flow of energy from the
resonant discrete mode to continuum modes due to their coupling. The approach
is also applicable to nonautonomous linear problems and to nonlinear problems.
We derive the time behavior of the resonant states for intermediate and long
times. Examples and applications are presented. Among them is a proof of the
instability of an embedded eigenvalue at a threshold energy under suitable
hypotheses.

electric charge and the wave parameters of the relevant quantities in the

background enters the Maxwell equations. We then assume that gravitational and

respect to electromagnetic waves and argue that this condition is consistent

relativity. Our aim is to evaluate the accuracy of the codes and to investigate
how the accuracy is affected by the choice of interpolation, domain of
integration and equation of state. In all three codes, the same physical
parameters, equations of state and interpolation method are used. We construct
25 selected models for polytropic equations of state and 22 models with
realistic neutron star matter equations of state. The three codes agree well
with each other (typical agreement is better than 0.1% to 0.01%) for most
models, except for the extreme assumption of uniform density stars. We conclude
that the codes can be used for the construction of highly accurate initial data
configurations for polytropes of index N > 0.5 (which typically correspond to
realistic neutron stars), when the domain of integration includes all space and
for realistic equations with no phase transitions. With the exception of the
uniform density case, the obtained values of physical parameters for the models
considered in this paper can be regarded as ``standard'' and we display them in
detail for all models.

two-flavor QCD. We argue that, as originally suggested by Aoki, there is a
phase in which flavor and parity are spontaneously broken. Recent numerical
results on the spectrum of the overlap Hamiltonian have been interpreted as
evidence against Aoki's conjecture. We show that they are in fact consistent
with the presence of a flavor-parity broken ``Aoki phase''. We also show how,
as the continuum limit is approached, one can study the lattice theory using
the continuum chiral Lagrangian supplemented by additional terms proportional
to powers of the lattice spacing. We find that there are two possible phase
structures at non-zero lattice spacing: (1) there is an Aoki phase of width
$\Delta m_0 \sim a^3$ with two massless Goldstone pions; (2) there is no
symmetry breaking, and all three pions have an equal non-vanishing mass of
order $a$. Present numerical evidence suggests that the former option is
realized for Wilson fermions. Our analysis then predicts the form of the pion
masses and the flavor-parity breaking condensate within the Aoki phase. Our
analysis also applies for non-perturbatively improved Wilson fermions.

infinite number of ghosts and antighosts. The minimal actions of Lagrangian
formulation which satisfy the master equation of Batalin and Vilkovisky have
the same Chern-Simons form as the starting classical actions. In the
Hamiltonian formulation we have used the formulation of cohomological
perturbation and explicitly shown that the gauge-fixed actions of both
formulations coincide even though the classical action breaks Dirac's
regularity condition. We find an interesting relation that the BRST charge of
Hamiltonian formulation is the odd-dimensional fermionic counterpart of the
topological action of Chern-Simons form. Although the quantization of two
dimensional models which include both bosonic and fermionic gauge fields are
investigated in detail, it is straightforward to extend the quantization into
arbitrary even dimensions. This completes the quantization of previously
proposed topological gravities in two and four dimensions.

present at energies well below the scale $m_\pi^2/M$ expected from naturalness
arguments. I ask whether, in the presence of such a shallow bound state, there
is a regularization scheme which leads to an EFT potential that is both useful
and systematic. In general, if a low-lying bound state is present then cutoff
regularization leads to an EFT potential which is useful but not systematic,
and dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction leads to one which is
systematic but not useful. The recently-proposed technique of dimensional
regularization with power-law divergence subtraction allows the definition of
an EFT potential which is both useful and systematic.

this paper we develop appropriate techniques of analysis and visualization of
such imaging data, in order to separate the signal from the noise, as well as
to characterize the signal. The techniques developed fall into the general
category of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively
use the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific
protocols for the analysis of fMRI, optical imaging and MEG data, and
illustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these
imaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct
stages: `noise' characterization and suppression, and `signal' characterization
and visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility
of a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to
account for non-stationarity in the data. Of particular note are (a) the
development of a decomposition technique (`space-frequency singular value
decomposition') that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image
data, and (b) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for
the removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from
cardiac and respiratory sources.
