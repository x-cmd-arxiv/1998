quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). In particular, it reveals a great deal about the
physical conditions within the atmospheres of accretion disks, a ubiquitous
component of QSO theories. A robust prediction of accretion disk models is a
significant polarization due to electron scattering just longward (in
wavelength) of the Lyman edge because of the wavelength dependence of the
Hydrogen absorption opacity. Observations of the Lyman edge regions of QSOs
have shown scant evidence for the predicted features-few QSOs show the broad,
partial Lyman edges expected to be common according to most theories, and none
show the high polarizations expected longward of the Lyman edge. Still,
polarization spectra of a small number of QSOs have shown a rising polarization
(up to 20%) at wavelengths shortward of the Lyman edge. We have now doubled our
sample of intermediate-redshift QSOs observed with the HST/FOS
spectropolarimeter to determine the amount of polarization on both sides of the
Lyman limit. For this new sample of six objects, polarizations are low and
mostly consistent with zero below the Lyman edge.
  Another important result of the new data is that it strengthens the
conclusion that quasars are generally not polarized significantly just longward
of the Lyman edge at $\sim 1000 \AA. There is no significant statistical
wavelength dependence to the polarization longward of the Lyman edge indicating
that simple plane-parallel atmospheres with scattering-dominated opacity are
not significant sources of UV flux in quasars.

of the non-classical inner structures are well fitted by an exponential
profile. These ``exponential bulges'' are fainter than R^1/4 bulges for given
total galaxy luminosity and (catalog) Hubble type later than Sab. B.
Irregular/exponential bulges typically host central compact sources. C. The
central sources are present in all types of disk galaxies, starting with
systems as early as S0a. About 60 % of Sb to Sc galaxies host a central compact
source. Many of the galaxies which host compact sources contain a barred
structure. D. Galaxies with apparent nuclear star formation and the brightest
compact sources, are preferentially the early- and intermediate- type (S0a-Sb)

isolated galaxies show indistinguishable properties. Independently from the
physical nature of the non-classical inner structures, our main conclusion is
that a significant fraction of galaxies classified from the ground as
relatively early-type shows a rich variety of central properties, and little or
no morphological/photometric evidence for a smooth, R^1/4-law bulge.

causing the gas to became clumped on a large scale. This wave produced a series
of superstarclusters along arcs and rings that emanate from the central point
of impact in the disk. The locations of these star forming regions match those

Galactic mid-plane (the so-called Galactic ridge) was measured with RXTE PCA in
order to determine the spatial extent, spectral nature, and origin of the
emission. Spatial examination of the diffuse emission in the central 30 deg of
the plane in Galactic longitude reveals the presence of two components: a thin
disk of full width less than 0.5 deg centered roughly on the Galactic
mid-plane, and a broad component which can be approximated as a Gaussian
distribution with FWHM of about 4 deg. Spectral examination of the emission
clearly reveals the presence of a hard power law tail above 10 keV and an
emission line from He-like iron, indicating both thermal and possibly
non-thermal origins for the diffuse emission. The averaged spectrum from the
ridge in the 3-35 keV band can be modelled with a Raymond-Smith plasma
component of temperature ~2-3 keV and a power law component of photon index
~1.8. Based on this finding, we argue that the temperature of the hot phase of
the Interstellar Medium (ISM) is less than the previously reported values of
5-15 keV. We find that a SN explosion rate of less than 5 per century is
adequate to power the thermal emission from the ridge. We speculate that
bremsstrahlung of accelerated electrons and protons in SNR sites can play a
significant role in producing the hard tail of the spectrum. Moreover, their
collisional losses can play a major role in the ionization of the ISM.

(E, S0 and S0a) is dominated by the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the cold stellar
component. The Mid-IR emission of late-type galaxies is instead dominated by
the thermal emission from dust. The small dust grains emitting in the Mid-IR
have an excess of emission if compared to big grains emitting in the Far-IR.
While the Far-IR emission increases with the intensity of the interstellar
radiation field, their Mid-IR emission is non--linearly related to the UV
radiation field. The spectral energy distributions of the target galaxies
indicate that there is a linear relationship between the UV radiation field and
the Mid-IR emission of galaxies for low or intermediate activities of star
formation, while the emission from the hot dust seems to drop for strong UV
fields. The Mid-IR colour of late-type galaxies is not related to their
activity of star formation. The properties of the dust emission in the Mid-IR
seem more related to the mass than to the morphological type of the target
galaxy. Since the activity of star formation is anticorrelated to the mass of
galaxies, this reflects a relationship between the emission of dust in the
Mid-IR and the UV radiation field: galaxies with the lowest Mid-IR emission for
a given UV field are low mass, dwarf galaxies. These observational evidences
are easily explained if the carriers of the Unidentified Infrared Bands that
dominate the 6.75 mic emission are destroyed by the intense UV radiation field
of dwarf galaxies, although abundance effects can also play a role.

possesses a kinetically perfect funnel-like energy landscape. We find that the
dependence of the relaxation time, $\tau$, on the density of states (DOS) and
the energy level spacing distributions of the model displays several main types
of behavior depending on the temperature $T$. This allows us to identify
possible generic features of the relaxation. For some ranges of $T$, $\tau$ is
insensitive to the density of states; for intermediate values of $T$ it depends
on the energy level spacing distribution rather than on the DOS directly, and
it becomes gradually more dependent on DOS with increasing temperature;
finally, the relaxation can also be determined exclusively by the presence of a
deep gap in the energy spectrum rather than by the detailed features of the
density of states. We found that the behavior of $\tau$ crucially depends on

  Rev B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.58.7252",,"cond-mat",,"  In this paper we shall propose a simple scheme for calculating Green's
functions for photons propagating in complex structured dielectrics or other
photonic systems. The method is based on an extension of the finite difference
time domain (FDTD) method, originally proposed by Yee, also known as the
Order-N method, which has recently become a popular way of calculating photonic
band structures. We give a new, transparent derivation of the Order-N method
which, in turn, enables us to give a simple yet rigorous derivation of the
criterion for numerical stability as well as statements of charge and energy
conservation which are exact even on the discrete lattice. We implement this
using a general, non-orthogonal co-ordinate system without incurring the
computational overheads normally associated with non-orthogonal FDTD.
  We present results for local densities of states calculated using this method
for a number of systems. Firstly, we consider a simple one dimensional
dielectric multilayer, identifying the suppression in the state density caused
by the photonic band gap and then observing the effect of introducing a defect
layer into the periodic structure. Secondly, we tackle a more realistic example
by treating a defect in a crystal of dielectric spheres on a diamond lattice.
This could have application to the design of super-efficient laser devices
utilising defects in photonic crystals as laser cavities.

inflation in supergravity and may emerge in theories with a non-anomalous or

one emerging in superstring theories. We discuss the complications one has to
face when trying to build up a successful $D$-term inflationary scenario in
superstring models. In particular, we show that the ``vacuum shifting''
phenomenon of string theories is usually very efficient even in the early
Universe, thus preventing inflation from taking place. On the other hand, when
$D$-term inflation is free to occur, the presence of a plethora of fields and
several non-anomalous additional abelian symmetries in string theories may help
in reconciling the value of the Fayet-Iliopoulos $D$-term required by the COBE
normalization with the value predicted by string theories. We also show that in
superstring $D$-term inflation gravitinos are likely to pose no cosmological

representations of the group under examination becomes, in the projective case,
a prototype of noncommuting spaces. For vector representations the algebraic
integration is equivalent to integrate over $\hat G$. However, its very
definition is related only at the structural properties of the group algebra,
therefore it is well defined also in the projective case, where the space $\hat

harmonic analysis. A particular attention is given to abelian groups, which are

system of diophantine approximations in projective spaces accumulates on a
finite number of proper linear subspaces. Given a subvariety $X$ of a
projective space $P^n$, does there exists a system of diophantine
approximations on $P^n$ whose solutions are Zariski dense in $P^n$, but lie in
finitely many proper subvarieties of $X$? One can gain insight into this
problem using a theorem of G. Faltings and G. W\""ustholz. Their construction
requires the hypothesis that the sum of some expected values has to be large.
This sum turns out to be proportional to a degree of contact of a weighted flag
of sections over the variety $X$. This invariant measures the semistability of
the Chow (or Hilbert) point of $X$ under the action of an appropriate reductive
algebraic group. Whence, the lower bound in the Faltings-W\""ustholz theorem may
be translated into a GIT language. This means that in order to show that a
system of diophantine approximations on $X$ is not under the control of Schmidt
Subspace Theorem, we must check the Chow-unstability of $X^s$, for some large
$s>0$.
