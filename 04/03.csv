We concentrate primarily on a sample in the Virgo cluster, which has HI and

the surface brightness of H$\alpha$ (a star formation indicator) with the HI
surface density, or with the ratio of this density to a dynamical timescale, as
found for large disk or starburst galaxies. On the other hand, we find the
strongest correlation to be with the average blue surface brightness,
indicating the presence of a mechanism regulating the star formation by the
older (up to 1 Gyr) stellar population if present, or by the stellar population
already formed in the present burst.

high energy nucleons and photons which may account for the detected flux of

the total luminosity of the universe, is 4 orders of magnitude larger than the

contribute significantly to the detected flux of >10^{20}eV cosmic-rays, the
existence of a new class of high-energy neutrino sources, likely unrelated to

deals with a recently suggested inversion technique as applied to atomic
hydrogen. This technique allows to determine 3D turbulence statistics through
the variations of 21 cm intensity. We claim that a radio interferometer is an
ideal tool for such a study as its visibility function is directly related to
the statistics of galactic HI. Next, we show how galactic rotation curve can be
used to study the turbulence slice by slice and relate the statistics given in
galactic coordinates and in the velocity space. The application of the
technique to HI data reveals a shallow spectrum of the underlying HI density
that is not compatible with a naive Kolmogorov picture. We show that the random
density corresponding to the found spectrum tends to form low contrast
filaments that are elongated towards the observer.

the evolutions of superbubbles with a three-dimensional (3D) numerical
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation. A superbubble is a large supernova
remnant driven by sequential supernova explosions in an OB association. Its
evolution is affected by the density stratification in the galactic disk. After
the size reaches 2--3 times the density scale-height, the superbubble expands
preferentially in the $z$-direction. Finally it can punch out the gas disk
(blow-out). On the other hand, the magnetic field running parallel to the
galactic disk has an effect to prevent from expanding in the direction
perpendicular to the field. The density stratification and the magnetic fields
have completely opposite effects on the evolution of the superbubble. We
present results of 3D MHD simulation in which both effects are included. As a
result, it is concluded that when the magnetic field has a much larger
scale-height than the density, even for a model that the bubble would blow out
from the disk if the magnetic field were absent, the magnetic field with the
strength of 5 $\mu$G can confine the bubble in $|z| \alt 300$ pc for $\simeq$20
Myr (confinement). In a model that the field strength decreases in the halo in
proportion to $B \propto \rho^{1/2}$, the superbubble eventually blows out like
a model of B=0 even if the magnetic field in the mid-plane is as strong as

Low-energy peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs), and quasar-hosted blazars (QHBs). We
find that the radiation process responsible for the HE peak for HBLs can be
explained solely by Synchrotron-Self-Compton (SSC) emission, with the Doppler
factor consistent with the VLBI and/or gamma-ray variability data. For many
QHBs, on the other hand, the gamma-rays cannot be solely due to the SSC
mechanism unless the Doppler factor is significantly in excess of that inferred
from VLBI data. We consider an alternative scenario consistent with the
measured values of the Doppler factor, where the SSC component is still present
in QHBs and it dominates in the X-ray band, but it is below the observed
gamma-ray spectrum. With an assumption that the peak of the SSC emission is on
the extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum, and adopting the Doppler factor of 10,
we infer the magnetic field to be 0.1 - 1 Gauss, and Lorentz factors of
electrons radiating at the peak of the nu F(nu) spectrum of 10^3 for QHBs; this
is much lower than 10^5 for HBLs. This difference is most likely due to the

ascribed to the weak lensing effect of the foreground dark matter, which is
traced by the APM galaxies. The amplitude of the effect found here is compared
to the analytical predictions from the literature, and to the predictions of a
phenomenological model, which is based on the observed counts-in-cells

on the Coulomb gas representation, are not available. Nevertheless the n-point
correlation functions are still given in terms of the determinant of a kernel,
known through an explicit integral representation. This kernel is no longer
symmetric though and is not readily accessible to standard methods. In
particular finding the level spacing probability is always a delicate problem
in Fredholm theory, and we have to reconsider the problem within our model. We
find a new class of universality for the level spacing distribution when the
spectrum of the source is ajusted to produce a vanishing gap in the density of
the state. The problem is solved through coupled non-linear differential
equations, which turn out to form a Hamiltonian system. As a result we find
that the level spacing probability $p(s)$ behaves like $\exp[ - C
s^{{8\over{3}}}]$ for large spacing $s$; this is consistent with the asymptotic
behavior $\exp[ - C s^{2 \beta + 2}]$, whenever the density of state behaves
near the edge as $\rho(\lambda)\sim \lambda^{\beta}$.

lowered by allowing the O atom to get off the short diagonal of the rhombus so

due to the finite conductivity, large-scale and short-scale deviations from the

exchange of light and/or massless elementary particles between the atoms of the

up to 30 times stronger than the best ones known up today. A possible
improvement of experimental parameters is proposed which gives the possibility

co-amenability of compact quantum groups, which allows us to compare it with
the amenability of subfactors.

(V)\otimes H$ is a corepresentation, and $\pi :H\to\l (W)$ is a representation,
then $u=(id\otimes\pi)v$ satisfies the equation $(t\otimes id)u^{-1}=((t\otimes
id)u)^{-1}$ of the vertex models for subfactors. A universal construction shows
that any solution $u$ of this equatio n arises in this way. A more elaborate
construction shows that there exists a ``minimal'' triple $(H,v,\pi)$
satisfying $(id\otimes\pi)v=u$. This paper is devoted to the study of this
latter construction of Hopf algebras. If $u$ is unitary we construct a
$\c^*$-norm on $H$ and we find a new description of the standard invariant of
the subfactor associated to $u$. We discuss also the ``twisted'' (i.e. $S^2\neq
id$) case.

frequently requires monitoring of the refractive index profile throughout the

WKBJ matrix representation of the optical transfer function of a single thin
film on a substrate. Mathematical expressions are developed which represent the
minima and maxima envelopes of the curves transmittance-vs-time and
reflectance-vs-time. The refractive index and extinction coefficient depth
profiles of different films are calculated from simulated spectra as well as
from experimental data obtained during PECVD of silicon-compound films.
Variation of the deposition rate with time is also evaluated from the position
of the spectra extrema as a function of time. The physical and mathematical
limitations of the method are discussed.

points. The usual approaches involve promotion of c-numbers to q-numbers, or
path integral constructs, each of which generally succeeds only in Cartesian
coordinates. All quantization schemes that lead to Hilbert space vectors and
Weyl operators---even those that eschew Cartesian coordinates---implicitly
contain a metric on a flat phase space. This feature is demonstrated by
studying the classical and quantum ``aggregations'', namely, the set of all
facts and properties resident in all classical and quantum theories,
respectively. Metrical quantization is an approach that elevates the flat phase
space metric inherent in any canonical quantization to the level of a
postulate. Far from being an unwanted structure, the flat phase space metric
carries essential physical information. It is shown how the metric, when
employed within a continuous-time regularization scheme, gives rise to an
unambiguous quantization procedure that automatically leads to a canonical
coherent state representation. Although attention in this paper is confined to
canonical quantization we note that alternative, nonflat metrics may also be
used, and they generally give rise to qualitatively different, noncanonical
quantization schemes.

Strategies in classical game theory are either pure (deterministic) or mixed
(probabilistic). We introduce these basic ideas in the context of a simple
example, closely related to the traditional Matching Pennies game. While not
every two-person zero-sum finite game has an equilibrium in the set of pure
strategies, von Neumann showed that there is always an equilibrium at which
each player follows a mixed strategy. A mixed strategy deviating from the
equilibrium strategy cannot increase a player's expected payoff. We show,
however, that in our example a player who implements a quantum strategy can
increase his expected payoff, and explain the relation to efficient quantum
algorithms. We prove that in general a quantum strategy is always at least as
good as a classical one, and furthermore that when both players use quantum
strategies there need not be any equilibrium, but if both are allowed mixed
quantum strategies there must be.
