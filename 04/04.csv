of the relative locations of eigenmodes and troughs in the spectral response.
It is suggested that the difference in measured phase function between the

  Finally I present a comparison between the numerical and asymptotic

redshift is slightly larger than the emission redshift of the quasar. We
estimate the column density of H$_2$ molecules
$N$(H$_2$)~$\sim$~6$\times$10$^{16}$~cm$^{-2}$ and the fractional abundance of
H$_2$, $f$~=~5.4$\times$10$^{-5}$. The excitation temperature derived for
different transitions suggests that the kinetic temperature of the cloud is
$\sim$200~K and the density $n$~$\sim$~1000~cm$^{-3}$. The cloud therefore has
a dimension of $\sim$1~pc along the line of sight. Since it obscures the
broad-line emission region, its transverse dimension should be larger than
10~pc.\par We obtain upper limits on the column densities of C~{\sc i}
($<$~10$^{12.7}$~cm$^{-2}$) and CO ($<$~10$^{13.2}$~cm$^{-2}$;
$N$(CO)/$N$(H~{\sc i})~$<$~7$\times$10$^{-9}$).We suggest that the ratio
$N$(H$_2$)/$N$(C~{\sc i}) is a useful indicator of the physical conditions in
the absorber. Simple photo-ionization models assuming solar relative abundances
show that radiation fields with spectra similar to typical AGNs or starbursts
are unable to reproduce all the constraints and in particular the surprisingly
small $N$(C~{\sc i})/ $N$(H$_2$) and $N$(Mg~{\sc i})/$N$(H$_2$) ratios. In view
of the models we explored, the most likely ionizing spectrum is a composite of
a UV- ""big bump"" possibly produced by a local starburst and a power-law
spectrum from the QSO that provides the X-rays. Dust is needed to explain the
production of molecules in the cloud. The amount of dust is broadly consistent
with the [Cr/Zn] abundance determination.

are presented for cases with minimal angular momentum, hence maximal random

modified quiet start technique to place particles on these orbits uniformly in
action-angle space, making the initial conditions as smooth as possible. The
most elliptical models initially showed bending instabilities; by the end of

aluminium are obtained. During the uniaxial loading, certain general behaviors
of energy versus stretch and the load versus the stretch are confirmed; in each
acse, there exist three special unstressed structures: f.c.c., b.c.c. and
f.c.t. for [001]; f.c.c., s.c. and b.c.c. for [111]. Using stability criteria,
we find that all of these state are unstable, and always occur together with
shear instability, except the natural f.c.c. structure. A Bain transformation
from the stable f.c.c. structure to the stable b.c.c. configuration cannot be
obtained by uniaxial compression along any equivalent [001] and [111]
direction. The tensile strength are similar for the two directions. For the
higher energy barrier of [111] direction, the compressive strength is greater
than that for the [001] direction. With increase in the ratio of the biaxial
proportional extension, the stress and tensile strength increase; however, the
critical strain does not change significantly. Our results add to the existing
ab initio database for use in fitting and testing interatomic potentials.

these spacetimes may be regarded as either globally hyperbolic timelike

our class, we classify all possible candidate quantum field algebras for
massive Klein-Gordon theory which obey the F-locality condition introduced by
Kay. This condition requires each point of spacetime to have an intrinsically
globally hyperbolic neighbourhood, N, such that the commutator (in the
candidate algebra) of fields smeared with test functions supported in N agrees
with the value obtained in the usual construction of Klein-Gordon theory on N.
  By considering bisolutions to the Klein-Gordon equation, we prove that
generic timelike cylinders admit a unique F-local algebra -- namely the algebra
obtained by the usual construction -- and that generic spacelike cylinders do
not admit any F-local algebras, and are therefore non F-quantum compatible.
Refined versions of our results are obtained for subclasses of metrics
invariant under a symmetry group. Thus F-local field theory on 2-dimensional
cylinder spacetimes essentially coincides with the usual globally hyperbolic
theory. In particular the result of the author and Higuchi that the Minkowskian
spacelike cylinder admits infinitely many F-local algebras is now seen to
represent an anomalous case.

10 fm/c) the hadron energy spectra in the cell are nicely reproduced by
Boltzmann distributions with a common rapidly dropping temperature. Hadron
yields change drastically and at the late expansion stage follow closely those
of an ideal gas statistical model. The detailed comparison with the UrQMD box
calculations for infinite equilibrated matter is done. It also shows that the
system in the central zone reaches the equilibrium at late stages of the
reaction. The equation of state seems to be simple at late times:
$P\cong0.12\epsilon$ which coincides with Shuryak predictions for the resonance
gas. The contribution of the strange particles into the total energy density of
the system in the central region of the reaction seems to be of order of 1-3 %
(strange particle density in the central zone is negligibly small e.g.
$\rho_S=0.008$). The time evolution of other thermodynamical variables in the
cell is also presented.

A57 (1998) 1572","10.1103/PhysRevA.57.1572",,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech gr-qc",,"  Quantum theory is formulated as the only consistent way to manipulate
probability amplitudes. The crucial ingredient is a consistency constraint: if
there are two different ways to compute an amplitude the two answers must
agree. This constraint is expressed in the form of functional equations the
solution of which leads to the usual sum and product rules for amplitudes. A
consequence is that the Schrodinger equation must be linear: non-linear
variants of quantum mechanics are inconsistent. The physical interpretation of
the theory is given in terms of a single natural rule. This rule, which does
not itself involve probabilities, is used to obtain a proof of Born's
statistical postulate. Thus, consistency leads to indeterminism.

weight function $w$ there is a kernel, expressible in terms of the polynomials
orthogonal with respect to the weight function, which plays an important role.
For the orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of Hermitian matrices there are
$2\times2$ matrix kernels, usually constructed using skew-orthogonal
polynomials, which play an analogous role. These matrix kernels are determined
by their upper left-hand entries. We derive formulas expressing these entries
in terms of the scalar kernel for the corresponding unitary ensembles. We also
show that whenever $w'/w$ is a rational function the entries are equal to the
scalar kernel plus some extra terms whose number equals the order of $w'/w$.
General formulas are obtained for these extra terms. We do not use
skew-orthogonal polynomials in the derivations.
