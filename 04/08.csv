that most 29SiO and 28SiO emission features are closely related but have not
the same spatial extent. We conclude that these masers are not excited in the
same gas layers in agreement with pumping models which predict that various v

depends sensitively on the neutrino transport between the neutrinospheres and
the shock. In light of this, we have performed a comparison of multigroup
Boltzmann neutrino transport (MGBT) and multigroup flux-limited diffusion
(MGFLD) in post-core bounce environments. Differences in the mean inverse flux
factors, luminosities, and RMS energies translate to heating rates that are up
to 2 times larger for Boltzmann transport, with net cooling rates below the
gain radius that are typically 0.8 times the MGFLD rates. These differences are
greatest at earlier postbounce times for a given progenitor mass, and for a
given postbounce time, greater for greater progenitor mass. The increased
differences with increased progenitor mass suggest that the net heating
enhancement from MGBT is potentially robust and self-regulated.

that the first zero-point of the autocorrelation function $\xi(s)$ increases

with the evolution of cosmic comoving emissivities in the available near

with the evolution of the neutral hydrogen content and average metallicity of

HI in the ISM is neglected. The ISM HI absorption results in a severe
diminishing of this flux--by almost three orders of magnitude at high redshifts

N^2$ to $\sim N\log N$ in the case of very large particle numbers, such tricks
are not suitable for all areas within stellar dynamics. When a stellar system
is close to equilibrium, and has a very high density, it still pays to compute
all interactions on a star by star basis, even for $N=10^5$. Any $cN\log N$

be expressed in terms of the SRB measures and volumes of the coarse graining
sets which cover the attractor. One can also study the entropy and entropy
production as functions of the degree of resolution of the coarse graining
process, and examine the limit as the coarse graining size approaches zero. We
show that this definition of the Gibbs entropy leads to a positive rate of
irreversible entropy production for reversible dissipative systems. We apply
the method to the case of a two dimensional map, based upon a model considered

biased-random walk. We treat both volume preserving and dissipative versions of
the basic map, and make a comparison between the two cases. We discuss the

graining cells for these biased-random walks and, for an open system with flux
boundary conditions, show regions of exponential growth and decay of the rate
of entropy production as the size of the cells decreases. This work describes

fluctuations are described within the nearly antiferromagnetic Fermi liquid
theory, whereas the phonons are treated using a shell model calculation of all

displaced ionic potentials screened by a background dielectric constant
$\epsilon_\infty$ and by holes within the CuO$_2$ planes. Taking into account
both interactions we get a superconducting state with $d_{x^2-y^2}$-symmetry,
whose origin are antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The investigation of all

pairing interaction is attractive. This is a necessary prerequisite for a
positive isotope effect. The size of the isotope exponent depends strongly on
the relative strength of the electron-phonon and spin fluctuation coupling. Due
to the strong electronic correlations no phononic induced superconducting

the unitarity triangle of the CKM matrix, can be determined in a theoretically
clean way by measuring mixing-induced CP violation in the decay $B_d \to J/\psi
K_S$. Another clean extraction of this CKM angle is provided by the
time-dependent angular distribution for the decay products of $B_d \to
J/\psi(\to l^+l^-) K^{\ast0}(\to \pi^0 K_S)$, where we have more observables at
our disposal than in the case of $B_d \to J/\psi K_S$, so that in addition to
$\sin(2\beta)$ also $\cos(2\beta)$ can be probed in a direct way. Unfortunately
a sign ambiguity remains in $\cos(2\beta)$. If it could be resolved, a discrete
ambiguity in the extraction of the CKM angle $\beta$ could be resolved as well,
which would allow a more incisive test of the CKM model of CP violation. This
note shows that detailed time-dependent studies of $B_{u,d} \to J/\psi
K^{\ast}$ and $B_s \to J/\psi \phi$ decay processes can determine the sign of
$\cos(2\beta)$, thereby removing the corresponding ambiguity in the extraction
of the CKM angle $\beta$.

stronger than indicated by 2-loop perturbation theory. This guarantees that the

applied to the full xi-t range of the total single-diffractive cross section,
we conclude that damping occurs only at low-xi and low-|t|. We give a (``toy'')
parametrization of the damping factor, D(xi), valid at low-|t|, which describes
the diffractive differential cross-section (dsig/dt) data at the ISR and
roughly accounts for the observed s-dependence of diffractive total
cross-section up to Tevatron energies. However, an effective damping factor
calculated for the CDF fitted function for dsig/dxidt at sqrt(s} = 1800 GeV and
|t| = 0.05 GeV^2, suggests that, at fixed-xi, damping increases as s increases.
  We conjecture that, in the regions where the triple-Regge formalism describes
the data and there is no evidence of damping, factorization is valid and the
Pomeron-flux-factor may be universal. With the assumption that the observed
damping is due to multi-Pomeron exchange, our results imply that the recent UA8
demonstration that the effective Pomeron trajectory flattens for |t| > 1 GeV$^2
is evidence for the onset of the perturbative 2-gluon pomeron. Our damping
results may also shed some light on the self-consistency of recent measurements

conjecture that it may be applicable within the universality class of QCD. We
discuss the status of the conjecture for the soluble case of pure two
dimensional Euclidean QCD on $T^2$, which is almost but not exactly self dual.
For higher dimensional theories, we discuss qualitative features consistent

pure QCD on $R^4$ and QCD on $R^2$ with two adjoint scalars. When $\Lambda^2 A

to an oriented quiver of type A_n. Given a finite sequence of vector bundles
with maps between them, these loci are described by putting rank conditions on
arbitrary composites of the maps. Our answer is a polynomial in Chern classes
of the bundles involved, depending on the given rank conditions. It can be
expressed as a linear combination of products of Schur polynomials in the
differences of the bundles. The coefficients are interesting generalizations of
Littlewood-Richardson numbers. These polynomials specialize to give new
formulas for Schubert polynomials.

show that many invariants of these blow-ups can be interpreted as numbers of
rational curves on P^r having specified global multiplicities or tangent
directions in the blown-up points. We give various numerical examples,
including a new easy way to determine the famous multiplicity d^{-3} for d-fold
coverings of rational curves on the quintic threefold, and, as an outlook, two

which we call bubble moves. One constructs a surjection from this set onto the
the bordism group of codimension one immersions in the manifold. The connected
sums of manifolds and immersions induce multiplicative structures which are
respected by this surjection. We prove that those cubulations which map
combinatorially into the standard decomposition of ${\bf R}^n$ for large enough
$n$ (called mappable), are equivalent. Finally we classify the cubulations of
the 2-sphere.

conditions, a reorganization of the spectrum takes place which creates a
bifurcation of the time scales with respect to the lifetimes of the resonance
states. We derive analytically the conditions under which the reorganization
process can be understood as a second-order phase transition and illustrate our
results by numerical investigations. The conditions are fulfilled e.g. for a
picket fence with equal coupling of the states to the continuum. Energy
dependencies within the system are included. We consider also the generic case
of an unfolded Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. In all these cases, the
reorganization of the spectrum occurs at the critical value $\alpha_{crit}$ of
the control parameter globally over the whole energy range of the spectrum. All
