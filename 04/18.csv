with FR I radio morphology. Despite higher radio core luminosities the
detection rate for our sample is much lower than in similar surveys of
late-type Seyfert galaxies. This puzzling difference between Seyferts and
low-power radio galaxies could be explained in several ways: a) the maser
emission is saturated and therefore independent of the radio core luminosity,
b) the masers are unsaturated and the background continuum source is associated
with the counter jet which is beamed away and relativistically dimmed in
radio-galaxies, or c) the amount, kinematics, or the distribution of the
molecular gas in the nuclei of Seyferts and radio galaxies is different.
Further studies of maser properties may therefore hold a clue for morphological
differences between active nuclei of Seyfert and early-type radio galaxies.

  The power density spectra (PDS) in 2x10^(-3)-1 Hz range is presented, which
shape is typical for flicker-noise processes, usually observed in black hole
candidates. The noise rms grows with energy from ~20% at 20 keV to ~30% at 80
keV. The source photon spectrum in the 15-200 keV energy range and its
variability over the pulse phase are reported. Approximately the shape of the
spectrum can be described by the ""canonical"" model for X-ray pulsars with
power-law index g~1.1, cut-off energy E_c~23 keV and folding energy E_f~19 keV.
All these parameters are weakly dependent on the luminosity. The most
significant deviation from this continuum is observed at ~100 keV in the
spectrum of the main pulse maximum. This feature is interpreted as a cyclotron
line. Comparison of the HEXE data with the data from BATSE/CGRO (Bildsten et

pulse profile differs substantially from the pulse profile in the

(ISM) in gas-rich disk-disk galaxy mergers in order to explore the origin of
fundamental chemical properties of halo ISM observed in elliptical galaxies.
Main results obtained in this chemodynamical study are the following three. (1)
Elliptical galaxies formed by gas-rich mergers show steep negative metallicity
gradients of ISM especially in the outer part of galaxies. The essential reason
for this is that chemical evolution of ISM in mergers proceeds in such an
inhomogeneous way that in the central part of mergers, metal-enrichment of ISM
is more efficient owing to radial inflow of metal-enriched ISM during
dissipative galaxy merging, whereas in the outer part, metal-enrichment is less
efficient owing to a larger amount of metal-enriched ISM tidally stripped away
from mergers. This result provides a clue to the origin of gaseous metallicity
gradients of elliptical halo recently revealed by ASCA. (2) Because of
inhomogeneous chemical evolution of ISM in mergers, some merger remnants show
mean gaseous metallicity discernibly smaller than mean stellar one. The degree
of difference in mean stellar and gaseous metallicity in a merger remnant
depends on chemical mixing length, galactic mass, and the effectiveness of
supernova feedback. (3) Elliptical galaxies formed by multiple mergers are more
likely to have metal-poor gaseous halo components and steep gaseous metallicity
gradients than those formed by pair mergers. This is principally because a
larger amount of less-metal enriched ISM can be tidally stripped away more
efficiently from galaxies in multiple mergers.

proton-antiproton collider from data collected by the CDF and D0 collaborations
during the period 1992--1996. The gauge boson couplings are a fundamental
prediction of the standard model, resulting from the non-Abelian nature of the
theory. Therefore, experimental tests of the couplings are of foremost
importance. We introduce the experimental results by reviewing the effective
Lagrangian formalism, the indirect constraints on the couplings from low-energy
experiments, and the expected values of the couplings in theories beyond the
standard model. Finally, we consider the prospects for future measurements.

scattering. A formalism is introduced that allows one to relate chosen quark
flavor polarizations to an arbitrary combination of final-state hadron spin
asymmetries. Within the context of the presented formalism, we quantify the
sensitivity of various semi-inclusive hadron asymmetries to the light quark
flavors. We show that unpolarized Lambda's may allow one to measure strange
quark and antiquark polarizations independently. We also highlight several
applications of our formalism, particularly to measurements intended to probe
further the spin structure of the nucleon.

effective field theory to describe the nonperturbative QCD dynamics of heavy
mesons. This effective theory incorporates with heavy quark symmetry (HQS) and
the heavy quark effective theory (HQET). Heavy mesons in this theory are
constructed as composite particles of a heavy quark bounded with the light
degrees of freedom. The heavy meson properties in the heavy quark limit and the
$1/m_Q$ corrections can then be explicitly evaluated from this effective
theory. All the basic parameters of the HQET, namely, the heavy quark mass
$m_Q$, the heavy meson residual mass $\overline{\Lambda}$, and the HQS breaking
mass parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, are consistently determined.
$\lambda_1$ is found to be small due to a large cancellation between the heavy
quark kinetic energy and the chromo-electric interaction between the heavy
quark and light degrees of freedom. We also evaluate the Isgur-Wise function,
the decay constant, and the axial-vector coupling constant of heavy mesons.

of the group U(N). Namely, we will be provided with a prescription which allows
to study a noncommutative geometry with rational parameter p/N by means of a
U(N) gauge theory on a torus of size \Sigma / N with the boundary conditions
given by a system with p units of magnetic flux. The transition to irrational

solution is used to describe high energy processes with non-zero longitudinal
momentum exchange, in which an arbitrary number of eigenvalues get transferred
between the two scattering states. We describe a direct correspondence between
these semi-classical SYM configurations and the Gross-Mende saddle points. We
also study in detail the pair production of D-particles via a one-loop
calculation which in the 1+1D gauge theory language is described by the
(perturbative) transition between states with different electric flux. Finally,
we discuss a possible connection between these calculations in which D-particle
production gives important corrections to the Gross-Mende process.

  Invariants","27 pages; LaTex; 44 eps figures included",,,"IMSc-98/04/15","hep-th math-ph math.MP",,"  Chern-Simons theories, which are topological quantum field theories, provide
a field theoretic framework for the study of knots and links in three
dimensions. These are rare examples of quantum field theories which can be
exactly and explicitly solved. Expectation values of Wilson link operators
yield a class of link invariants, the simplest of them is the famous Jones
polynomial. Other invariants are more powerful than that of Jones. These new
invariants are sensitive to the chirality of all knots at least upto ten
crossing number unlike those of Jones which are blind to the chirality of some
of them. However, all these invariants are still not good enough to distinguish
a class of knots called mutants. These link invariants can be alternately
obtained from two dimensional vertex models. The $R$-matrix of such a model in
a particular limit of the spectral parameter provides a representation of the
braid group. This in turn is used to construct the link invariants. Exploiting
theorems of Lickorish and Wallace and also those of Kirby, Fenn and Rourke
which relate three-manifolds to surgeries on framed links, these link
invariants in $S^3$ can also be used to construct three-manifold invariants.
