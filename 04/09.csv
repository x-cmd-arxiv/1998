obtained spectra with a combined wavelength range covering 4000 Angstroms to
1.6 microns, and spectropolarimetric observations between 4000 Angstroms and
9000 Angstroms. We identify WN J0717+4611 as a quasar based on broad emission
of Mg II 2799 (FWHM ~ 11,000 km/s), a stellar R_S band Lick image and the high
luminosity of the object (M_B = -24.2). The optical linear polarization is
wavelength-independent at 15% in both the continuum and the emission lines,
with the polarization angle orthogonal to the radio jet axis. We argue that the
polarization mechanism is scattering of quasar light by surrounding small dust
grains or electrons. WN J0717+4611 appears highly reddened for a core-dominated
quasar.

previously found (~500,000/mag/deg^2), but at K<22 to be consistent with most
other surveys in amplitude and slope (~0.36). J band counts have similar slope.
J and K counts are in excess of our empirical no-evolution models for an open
universe, and a factor of 2 higher than mild-evolution models at J and K ~ 23.
The slope of the model counts is insensitive to geometry even in the
near-infrared because the counts are dominated by low-luminosity (<0.1L*)
objects at modest redshift (z<1) with small apparent sizes (r05<0.4"", i.e. <4
kpc). The observed counts rise most steeply for these smaller objects, which
dominate fainter than K=22.3 and J=23.3. However, the greatest excess relative
to no-evolution models occurs for the apparently larger objects (median
J-K~1.5). The size and colors of such objects correspond equally well to
luminous (>0.1L*), galaxies at 1<z<4, or progressively more diffuse,
low-luminosity (0.001-0.1L*) galaxies at z<1. We rule out the excess is from
very low luminosity (<0.0001L*) red galaxies at z<0.25. There is a deficit of
galaxies with red J-K colors corresponding to luminous, early-type galaxies at

to favour the so called mirror model between different inverse Compton
scattering models proposed as a possible explanation of gamma-ray emission in
blazars. We performed kinematic analysis of the relativistic blob - mirror
system and found that only part of the mirror located very close to the jet
axis (very likely inside the jet cone) can re-emit soft photons which serve as
a target for production of $\gamma$-rays by relativistic electrons in the blob.
Since the presence of well localized scattering mirror inside the jet is
problematic, this makes problems for the mirror model. The time scale and the
shape of the $\gamma$-ray flare should reflect, in terms of the mirror model,
the blob dimensions and the longitudinal distribution of relativistic electrons
inside the blob. For the $\gamma$-ray light curve of the type observed in 1996
from 3C 279, i.e. the rising time of the flare during a few days with a sharp
cut-off towards the end of the flare, the density of electrons inside the blob
should increase exponentially starting from the front of the blob and reach
maximum towards the end of the blob. Such distribution of electrons is
difficult to explain in a model of a relativistic shock moving along the jet,
which would rather inject electrons more efficiently at the front of the blob
with a trail of particles on its downstream side.

a prominent elongated structure, centered on the nucleus, extended by ~2"" at a

interpret this as an inclined, ~40 parsec diameter, thin nuclear disk of
ionized gas rather than a jet-gas cloud interaction. We do see several weaker
PA features, some of which may be circumnuclear gas clouds shocked by the
X-ray/radio jet. The disk is one of the smallest ever observed at the nucleus
of an AGN. It is not perpendicular to the jet, but consistent with being
oriented along the major axis of the bulge. If it represents the warped outer
portion of an accretion disk around a black hole, we conclude that even on the

potential and not directly related to the symmetry axis of the AGN.

the star formation history of galaxy mergers is a crucial determinant for the
nature of stellar populations of merger remnants, and therefore investigate how
the difference in star formation history between galaxy mergers affects the
chemical evolution of galaxy mergers. We found that the rapidity of star
formation, which is defined as the ratio of the dynamical time-scale to the
time-scale of gas consumption by star formation, is the most important
determinant for a number of fundamental characteristics of stellar populations
of merger remnants. We mainly demonstrate that even the chemical evolution of
elliptical galaxies can be strongly affected by the details of dynamical
evolution of galaxy merging. Based upon the present numerical results, we adopt
a specific assumption of the luminosity dependence of the rapidity of star

infinitesimal automorphisms of the quadric corresponding to the Levi form of
the manifold, and behaves ``almost'' like a Cartan connection. The construction
is explicit and allows us to study the properties of the parallelism as well as
those of its curvature form. It also leads to a natural class of ``semi-flat''
manifolds for which the two bundles reduce to a single one and the parallelism
turns into a true Cartan connection. In addition, for real-analytic manifolds
we describe certain local normal forms that do not require passing to bundles,

ion-ion collisions at energies from 17-200 GeV. First a high energy, fast
cascade is performed, in which original baryons and freed hard partons, if any,
collide. This stage ignores energy loss from soft (slow) processes. In this
first version no hard processes, aside from Drell-Yan production, are included.
The space-time history of the hard phase is then used as input to reconstruct
soft energy-loss, which occurs over a longer time scale. Soft meson production
is therefore treated as coherent over groups of interacting nucleons. Two body
data, though, are used extensively to guide the reinitialisation of the
cascade, which satisfies conservation laws for charge, strangeness and of
course, energy-momentum. A second phase, low energy cascade is finally carried
out among the products of the hard cascade. The model selected to describe
elementary hadron-hadron collisions in the soft cascade incorporates generic
mesons and baryons, which are the agents for rescattering. We imagine a
constituent quark model applies, with generic mesons consisting of an excited
quark-antiquark pair, and generic baryons constructed from three quarks. The
chief result is a reconciliation of the important Drell-Yan measurements,
indicating high-mass lepton pairs are produced as if no energy is lost from the
nucleons, with the apparent success of a purely hadronic, soft cascade in
describing nucleon stopping and meson production in heavy ion experiments at
the CERN SPS.

similar to that of nucleons, the $K^+$ flow almost disappears. This difference

The comparisons with the experimental data, as well as theoretical results from
