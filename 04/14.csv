supernova. We investigate spherically symmetric supernova fallback using a
relativistic radiation hydrodynamics Lagrangian code that handles radiation
transport in all regimes. Our goal is to answer the fundamental question: did
SN1987A produce a black hole and, if so, when will the hole become detectable ?
We compute the light curve, assuming that a black hole has been formed during
the explosion, and compare it with the observations. Our preliminary
calculations lack radioactive energy input and adopt a very simple chemical
composition (pure hydrogen). As a result, our computed models cannot fit the
observed data of SN1987A in detail. Nevertheless, we can show that, during the
first hours, the accretion flow is self--regulated and the accretion luminosity
stays very close to the Eddington limit. The light curve is completely
dominated, during the first few weeks, by the emission of the stellar envelope
thermal energy, and resembles that obtained in ``standard'' supernova theory.
Only long after hydrogen recombination takes place is there even a chance to
actually detect radiation from the accreting black hole above the emission of
the expanding envelope. The presence of a black hole is thus not inconsistent
with observations to date. Because of the exponential decay of the $^{44}$Ti
radioactive heating rate, the date of the emergence of the black hole is not
very sensitive to the actual parameters of the models and turns out to be about
1000 years. The bulk of the emission then is expected to be in the visible
band, but will be unobservable with present instrumentation. We discuss the
implications of our results in connection with the possible emergence of a
black hole in other supernovae.

N-body calculations for N=2000, 4096 and 10000 particles. The density,
velocity, mass distributions, energy generation, number of binaries etc. follow
the N-body results. Only the number of escapers is slightly too high compared
to N-body results and there is no level off anisotropy for advanced
post-collapse evolution of Monte-Carlo models as is seen in N-body simulations
for N < 2000. For simulations with N > 10000 gravothermal oscillations are

several different models to improve statistical quality of the data and run
individual models with N as large as 100000. The Monte-Carlo scheme can be
regarded as a method which lies in the middle between direct N-body and
Fokker-Planck models and combines most advantages of both methods.

explain certain ``puzzles'' in the literature on four dimensional orientifolds.

cancellation conditions have no solution. However, these tadpole cancellation
conditions are derived using the world-sheet approach which we argue to be
inadequate in these cases due to appearance of additional non-perturbative
sectors. The main tools in our analyses are the map between F-theory and
orientifold vacua and Type I-heterotic duality. Utilizing the consistency
conditions we have found in this paper, we discuss consistent four dimensional

collection $(\cca_{\xi})_{\xi<\omega_1}$ of families of finite subsets of $\nn$
(where, $\cca_k$ consists of all $k$--element subset of $M$, for $k\in \nn$)
with the properties that each $\cca_{\xi}$ is thin (i.e. it does not contain
proper initial segments of any of its element) and the Cantor--Bendixson index,
defined for $\cca_{\xi}$, is equal to $\xi+1$ and stable when we restrict
ourselves to any subset of $M$. We indicate how to extend the generalized
Schreier families to a system of uniform families. Using that notion we
establish the correct (countable) ordinal index generalization of the classical
Ramsey theorem (which corresponds to the finite ordinal indices).

Property (SEP) for Banach spaces; the Complete Separable Extension Property
(CSEP) and the Complete Separable Complemention Property (CSCP). The results
use the technique of a new proof of Sobczyk's Theorem, which also yields new
results for the SEP in the non-separable situation, e.g., $(\oplus_{n=1}^\infty
Z_n)_{c_0}$ has the $(2+\ep)$-SEP for all $\ep>0$ if $Z_1,Z_2,...$ have the
1-SEP; in particular, $c_0 (\ell^\infty)$ has the SEP. It is proved that e.g.,
$c_0(\bR\oplus\bC)$ has the CSEP (where $\bR$, $\bC$ denote Row, Column space
respectively) as a consequence of the general principle: if $Z_1,Z_2,...$ is a
uniformly exact sequence of injective operator spaces, then
$(\oplus_{n=1}^\infty Z_n)_{c_0}$ has the CSEP. Similarly, e.g., $\bK_0 \defeq
(\oplus_{n=1}^\infty M_n)_{c_0}$ has the CSCP, due to the general principle:
$(\oplus_{n=1}^\infty Z_n)_{c_0}$ has the CSCP if $Z_1,Z_2,...$ are injective
separable operator spaces. Further structural results are obtained for these
properties, and several open problems and conjectures are discussed.

studied using variational chain summation methods and the new Argonne v18
two-nucleon interaction. The neutron star gravitational mass limit obtained
with this interaction is 1.67 M_{solar}. Boost corrections to the two-nucleon
interaction, which give the leading relativistic effect of order (v/c)^2, as
well as three-nucleon interactions, are also included in the nuclear
Hamiltonian. Their successive addition increases the mass limit to 1.80 and
2.20 M_{solar}. Hamiltonians including a three-nucleon interaction predict a
transition in neutron star matter to a phase with neutral pion condensation at
a baryon number density of 0.2 fm^{-3}. We also investigate the possibility of
dense nucleon matter having an admixture of quark matter, described using the
bag model equation of state. Neutron stars of 1.4 M_{solar} do not appear to
have quark matter admixtures in their cores. However, the heaviest stars are
predicted to have cores consisting of a quark and nucleon matter mixture. These
admixtures reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars from 2.20 to 2.02 (1.91)
M_{solar} for bag constant B = 200 (122) MeV/fm^3. Stars with pure quark matter
in their cores are found to be unstable. We also consider the possibility that
matter is maximally incompressible above an assumed density, and show that
realistic models of nuclear forces limit the maximum mass of neutron stars to
be below 2.5 M_{solar}. The effects of the phase transitions on the composition
of neutron star matter and its adiabatic index are discussed.

  Workshop, ""Nuclear Physics with Effective Field Theories""",,,"MC/TH 98/05","nucl-th hep-ph",,"  The renormalisation of NN scattering in theories with zero-range interactions
is examined using a cut-off regularisation where the cut-off is taken to
infinity, dimensional regularisation (DR) with minimal subtraction, and DR with
power-divergence subtraction. In the infinite cut-off limit power counting
breaks down: terms of different orders in the potential contribute to the
scattering amplitude at the same order. Minimal subtraction does yield a
systematic expansion, but with a very limited range of validity for systems
that have unnaturally large scattering lengths. For a finite cut-off, the
behaviour of the couplings as the cut-off is lowered shows that a theory with a
natural scattering length approaches an IR fixed point. In the corresponding
effective theory, loop corrections can be treated perturbatively. In contrast,
if there is an IR fixed point for systems with an infinite scattering length it
must be a nonperturbative one, with no power counting. For such systems,
power-divergence subtraction appears to yield a systematic expansion, but with
a different power counting from Weinberg's. However the scheme omits IR
divergent terms that would otherwise lead to nonperturbative behaviour and so
the interpretation of the fixed point remains unclear.

the distribution is nonlinear. The details depend on whether the ions are fixed
