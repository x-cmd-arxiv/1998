constants over the course of cosmological evolution, and different versions of
the theories predict different time dependences. In particular, such variations
could manifest themselves as changes of the proton-to-electron mass ratio
\mu=m_p/m_e over the period of ~ 10^{10} years since the moment of formation of
high-redshift QSO spectra. Here we analyze a new, high-resolution spectrum of
the z=2.81080 molecular hydrogen absorption system toward the quasar PKS
0528-250 to derive a new observational constraint to the time-averaged
variation rate of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. We find |\dot{\mu} / \mu|
< 1.5 \times 10^{-14}/year, which is much tighter than previously measured
limits.

basis of a duality model which takes into account salient features of both
itinerant fermions and ""localized"" component of spin degrees of freedom. The
problem is analyzed in the framework of induced-moment mechanism by taking a
singlet-singlet crystal field scheme together with the nesting property of
partial Fermi surface of itinerant fermions . It is shown that the extremely
small ordered moment $m$ of ${\cal O}$($10^{-2}$$\times$$\mu_{B}$) can be
compatible with the large specific-heat jump at the transition temperature
$T_{N}$. Analysis performed in the presence of external magnetic field shows
that the field dependence of $m$ in the limit T\to 0 and T_{N}$ do not scale
except very near the critical field B which is consistent with a recent
observation by Mentink. It is also shown that the antiferromagnetic magnetic
order gives rise to a tiny amount of antiferromagnetic orbital order of
f-electrons.

and their weak decays. Trying to remain at the next-to-elementary level and
skip technicalities, I concentrate on the qualitative description of the most
important applications and physical meaning of the theoretical statements. The
numerical results of the dedicated theoretical analyses of extracting V_cb are
given and the possibilities to determine V_ub in future are discussed. At the
same time I describe in simple language subtle peculiarities distinguishing
actual QCD of heavy quarks from naive quantum mechanical treatment often
applied to heavy flavor hadrons. These subtleties are often mistreated.
Particular attention is paid to the concept of the heavy quark mass and its
evaluation, to the kinetic operator and the question of the 1/m_Q corrections
to inclusive widths of heavy flavor hadrons. I argue that the properly defined
b quark mass is known with a good accuracy from the \bar{b} b threshold cross
section.

angular sizes of astronomical radio sources and stars from correlations of
signal intensities, rather than amplitudes, in independent detectors. Their
subsequent correlation experiments demonstrating quantum bunching of photons in
incoherent light beams were seminal in the development of quantum optics. Since
that time the technique of ""intensity interferometry"" has become a valuable
probe of high energy nuclear and particle collisions, providing information on
the space-time geometry of the collision. The effect is one of the few
measurements in elementary particle detection that depends on the wave
mechanics of the produced particles. Here we discuss the basic physics of
intensity interferometry, and its current applications in high energy nuclear
physics, as well as recent applications in condensed matter and atomic physics.
