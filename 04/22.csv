should spin at millisecond rates. In accordance with this idea, quasi-periodic
oscillations discovered in X-ray binaries around 50 Hz and 1 kHz, and drifting
oscillations at several 100 Hz in X-ray bursts have all been interpreted in
terms of millisecond spins of weakly magnetized neutron stars. However, in 15
years of searching, the expected coherent millisecond signals from X-ray
binaries remained elusive. In this Letter, we report the discovery of the first

persistent 2.49 millisecond X-ray pulsations in an X-ray binary, which we
interpret to come from an accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar in the

as a millisecond radio pulsar when the accretion turns off completely. The

branches (HB's) in the metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 slope
upward with decreasing B-V. Such a slope is not predicted by canonical HB
models and cannot be produced by either a greater cluster age or enhanced mass
loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). The peculiar HB morphology in these
clusters may provide an important clue for understanding the second-parameter
effect.
  We have carried out extensive evolutionary calculations and numerical
simulations in order to explore three non-canonical scenarios for explaining
the sloped HB's in NGC 6388 and NGC 6441: i) A high cluster helium abundance
scenario, where the HB evolution is characterized by long blue loops; ii) A
rotation scenario, where internal rotation during the RGB phase increases the
HB core mass; iii) A helium-mixing scenario, where deep mixing on the RGB
enhances the envelope helium abundance. All three of these scenarios predict
sloped HB's with anomalously bright RR Lyrae variables. We compare this
prediction with the properties of the two known RR Lyrae variables in NGC 6388.
Other possible observational tests are suggested.

galaxy mergers in order to clarify whether or not galaxy mergers with the
widely spread merging epoch can reproduce reasonably well the observed small
scatter of the color-magnitude (C-M) relation in cluster ellipticals at low and
intermediate redshift (z<1). We consider that merger progenitor disks begin to
consume interstellar gas at moderate rate from z ~ 5 and then merge to form an
elliptical with the secondary starburst at z=z_merge. We find that even if the
epoch of galaxy merging is rather extended (0.3<z_merge<3.0), the dispersion in
the rest-frame U-V color among galaxy mergers is well within the observed one
(~0.05 mag at z = 0). We also find that the z_merge is required to be within a
certain range to keep the observed C-M relation tight at a given z. For
example, the required range of z_merge in galaxy mergers between Sa disks is
1.3<z_merge<3.0 for cluster ellipticals at z = 0.895, 0.9<z_merge<3.0 for z =
0.55, and 0.3<z_merge<3.0 for z = 0. The main reason for the derived small
scatter is that younger stellar populations, which are formed during the
secondary starburst of galaxy mergers, are formed preferentially from more
metal-enriched interstellar gas. This result reinforces the Worthey's
suggestion (Worthey et al. 1996) that the age-metallicity conspiracy, which
means that younger stellar populations are preferentially more metal-enriched,
can operate to keep the tight C-M relation. These numerical results imply that
the observed small scatter in the C-M relation at low and intermediate redshift
(z < 1) does not necessarily require the coevality of elliptical galaxies in
clusters or their formation at high z, which has been conventionally believed
in the classical passive evolution picture.

The bispectrum, which is the analogue of the temperature 3-point correlation
function in harmonic space, is zero for most inflationary models, but non-zero
for non-gaussian models. The expected departures from zero are small, and
easily masked by noise, so it is important to be able to estimate the
bispectrum coefficients as accurately as possible, and to know the errors and
correlations between the estimates so they may be used in combination as a
diagnostic to rule out non-gaussian models. This paper presents a method for
estimating in an unbiased way the bispectrum from a microwave background map in
the near-gaussian limit. The method is optimal, in the sense that no other
method can have smaller error bars, and in addition, the covariances between
the bispectrum estimates are calculated explicitly. The method deals
automatically with partial sky coverage and arbitrary noise correlations
without modification. A preliminary application to the Cosmic Background

effective Hamiltonian and a factorization Ansatz for the hadronic matrix
elements of the four-quark operators, we reassess branching fractions in
two-body non-leptonic decays $B \to PP, PV, VV$, involving the lowest lying
light pseudoscalar $(P)$ and vector $(V)$ mesons in the standard model. Using
the sensitivity of the decay rates on the effective number of colors, $N_c$, as
a criterion of theoretical predictivity, we classify all the current-current
(tree) and penguin transitions in five different classes. The recently measured
charmless two-body $B \to PP$ decays $(B^+ \to K^+ \eta^\prime, B^0 \to K^0
\eta^\prime, B^0 \to K^+\pi^-, B^+ \to \pi^+ K^0$ and charge conjugates) are
dominated by the $N_c$-stable QCD penguins (class-IV transitions) and their
estimates are consistent with data. The measured charmless $B \to PV$ $(B^+ \to
\omega K^+, ~B^+ \to \omega h^+)$ and $B\to VV$ transition $(B \to \phi K^*)$,
on the other hand, belong to the penguin (class-V) and tree (class-III)
transitions. The class-V penguin transitions are in general more difficult to
predict. We propose a number of tests of the factorization framework in terms
of the ratios of branching ratios for some selected $B \to h_1 h_2$ decays
involving light hadrons $h_1$ and $h_2$, which depend only moderately on the
form factors. We also propose a set of measurements to determine the effective
coefficients of the current-current and QCD penguin operators. The potential
impact of $B \to h_1 h_2$ decays on the CKM phenomenology is emphasized by
analyzing a number of decay rates in the factorization framework.

D58 (1998) 125017","10.1103/PhysRevD.58.125017",,"hep-th",,"  We develop a systematic method for computing a renormalized light-front field
theory Hamiltonian that can lead to bound states that rapidly converge in an
expansion in free-particle Fock-space sectors. To accomplish this without
dropping any Fock sectors from the theory, and to regulate the Hamiltonian, we
suppress the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian between free-particle
Fock-space states that differ in free mass by more than a cutoff. The cutoff
violates a number of physical principles of the theory, and thus the
Hamiltonian is not just the canonical Hamiltonian with masses and couplings
redefined by renormalization. Instead, the Hamiltonian must be allowed to
contain all operators that are consistent with the unviolated physical
principles of the theory. We show that if we require the Hamiltonian to produce
cutoff-independent physical quantities and we require it to respect the
unviolated physical principles of the theory, then its matrix elements are
uniquely determined in terms of the fundamental parameters of the theory. This
method is designed to be applied to QCD, but for simplicity, we illustrate our
method by computing and analyzing second- and third-order matrix elements of
the Hamiltonian in massless phi-cubed theory in six dimensions.

system give rise to a particular representation of a chiral Kac-Moody current

obtain a ``twisted'' representation of the current algebra. The condition for
stationarity of currents is the same as the classical Kirchoff's law applied to
the currents at the interaction point. We find that in the case of two discs
touching at one point, since the currents are chiral, they are not stationary
and one obtains current oscillations between the two discs. We determine the
frequency of these oscillations in terms of an effective parameter
characterizing the interaction. The chiral conformal field theories can be
represented in terms of bosonic Lagrangians with a boundary interaction. We
discuss how these one point interactions can be represented as boundary
conditions on fields, and how the requirement of chirality leads to
restrictions on the interactions described by these Lagrangians. By gauging
these models we find that the theory is naturally coupled to a Chern-Simons
gauge theory in 2+1 dimensions, and this coupling is completely determined by
the requirement of anomaly cancellation.

Harvey as an analogy, in the context of Teichmuller space, for Tits buildings
for symmetric spaces, and has been studied by Harer and Ivanov as a tool for
understanding mapping class groups of surfaces.
  In this paper we prove that, endowed with a natural metric, the complex is
hyperbolic in the sense of Gromov. In a certain sense this hyperbolicity is an
explanation of why the Teichmuller space has some negative-curvature properties
in spite of not being itself hyperbolic: Hyperbolicity in the Teichmuller space
fails most obviously in the regions corresponding to surfaces where some curve
is extremely short. The complex of curves exactly encodes the intersection
patterns of this family of regions (it is the ""nerve"" of the family), and we
show that its hyperbolicity means that the Teichmuller space is ""relatively
hyperbolic"" with respect to this family. A similar relative hyperbolicity
result is proved for the mapping class group of a surface.
  We also show that the action of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes on the complex
is hyperbolic, with a uniform bound on translation distance.

  the photon statistics at a low-injection level","10 pages, 8 figures","Phys.Rev. A57 (1998) 3074","10.1103/PhysRevA.57.3074",,"quant-ph",,"  From the microscopic quantum Langevin equations (QLEs) we derive the
effective semiconductor QLEs and the associated noise correlations which are
valid at a low-injection level and in real devices. Applying the semiconductor
QLEs to semiconductor light-emitting devices (LEDs), we obtain a new formula
for the Fano factor of photons which gives the photon-number statistics as a
function of the pump statistics and several parameters of LEDs. Key ingredients
are non-radiative processes, carrier-number dependence of the radiative and
non-radiative lifetimes, and multimodeness of LEDs. The formula is applicable
to the actual cases where the quantum efficiency $\eta$ differs from the
differential quantum efficiency $\eta_{d}$, whereas previous theories
implicitly assumed $\eta = \eta_{d}$. It is also applicable to the cases when
photons in each mode of the cavity are emitted and/or detected inhomogeneously.
When $\eta_{d} < \eta$ at a running point, in particular, our formula predicts
that even a Poissonian pump can produce sub-Poissonian light. This mechanism
for generation of sub-Poissonian light is completely different from those of
previous theories, which assumed sub-Poissonian statistics for the current
injected into the active layers of LEDs. Our results agree with recent
experiments. We also discuss frequency dependence of the photon statistics.

that nevertheless cannot be reliably distinguished by a pair of separated
observers ignorant of which of the states has been presented to them, even if
the observers are allowed any sequence of local operations and classical
communication between the separate observers. It is proved that there is a
finite gap between the mutual information obtainable by a joint measurement on
these states and a measurement in which only local actions are permitted. This
result implies the existence of separable superoperators that cannot be
implemented locally. A set of states are found involving three two-state
particles which also appear to be nonmeasurable locally. These and other
multipartite states are classified according to the entropy and entanglement
costs of preparing and measuring them by local operations.
