mergers allows us to better understand the possible effects of a merger event
on the globular cluster system of a galaxy, and to foresee the properties of
the end-product. By comparing these expectations to the properties of globular
cluster systems of today's elliptical galaxies we can constrain merger models.
The observational data indicate that i) every gaseous merger induces the
formation of new star clusters, ii) the number of new clusters formed in such a
merger increases with the gas content of the progenitor galaxies.
Low-luminosity (about M_V>-21), disky ellipticals are generally thought to be
the result of a gaseous merger. As such, new globular clusters are expected to
form but have not been detected to date. We investigate various reasons for the
non-detection of sub-populations in low-luminosity ellipticals, i.e. absence of
an old population, absence of a new population, destruction of one of the
populations, and finally, an age-metallicity conspiracy that allows old and new
globular clusters to appear indistinguishable at the present epoch. All of
these possibilities lead us to a similar conclusion, namely that low-luminosity
ellipticals did not form recently (z<1) in a gas-rich merger, and might not
have formed in a major merger of stellar systems at all. High-luminosity
ellipticals do reveal globular cluster sub-populations. However, it is
difficult to account for the two populations in terms of mergers alone, and in
particular, we can rule out scenarios in which the second sub-population is the
product of a recent, gas-poor merger.

galaxy clusters. We find that an evolving population of clusters can produce a
fraction $\sim 0.5 \div 2 %$ of the diffuse gamma-ray background (DGRB)
observed by EGRET. This result is robust and is weakly dependent on the
cosmological scenario and on the degree of evolution of the inter galactic
medium (IGM) in distant clusters, because the bulk of the sources contributing
to the DGRB is located at redshifts $z \simlt 0.2$. We also found a correlation
between the non-thermal, gamma-ray and the thermal X-ray emissions from these
structures. Using this result, we derived a list of gamma-ray clusters
observable with the next generation $\gamma$-ray detectors. Finally, we briefly
discuss the possible relevance of galaxy clusters for neutrino astronomy and

central source surrounded by a less intense ring, which we identify with the
inner edge of an accretion disk. These may be the first direct measurements of
the spatial structure and geometry of the accreting black-hole system in an

in AGNs is normally attributed to intrinsic physical changes in the X-ray

properties of these objects. Understanding these observations presents a
formidable challenge to theoretical models of the accretion flow onto the
compact object and of the physical mechanisms that generate high-energy
radiation. Here we summarize the current state of observations and theoretical
interpretation of the emission from BHCs above 20 keV.
  The all-sky monitoring capability of BATSE allows nearly continuous studies
of the high-energy emission from more than a dozen BHCs. These long-term
datasets are particularly well-suited to multi-wavelength studies. Energy
spectral evolution and/or state transitions have been observed from many of the
BHCs.
  Observations above 50 keV from OSSE demonstrate the existence of two gamma
ray spectral states that appear to be the extensions of the X-ray low/hard and
high/soft (or perhaps very high) states. The former state, the ""breaking""
state, cuts off with e-folding energy ~100 keV and has its peak luminosity near
this energy. In contrast, the latter state has luminosity peaking in the soft
X-rays and an unbroken power law spectrum, even up to energies above 500 keV in
some cases.
  The breaking gamma-ray spectrum can be well modeled by Comptonization of soft
photons in a hot thermal plasma. The power-law state creates more significant
theoretical challenges. It has been suggested that in this state the high-
energy emission arises from bulk-motion Comptonization in the convergent
accretion flow from the inner edge of the accretion disk.

fragmentation at the CERN SPS energy, the high-$p_T$ hadron distribution should
be highly sensitive to parton energy loss inside a dense medium as predicted by
recent perturbative QCD (pQCD) studies. A careful analysis of recent data from
CERN SPS experiments via pQCD calculation shows little evidence of energy loss.
This implies that either the life-time of the dense partonic matter is very
short or one has to re-think about the problem of parton energy loss in dense
matter. The hadronic matter does not seem to cause jet quenching in $Pb+Pb$
collisions at the CERN SPS. High-$p_T$ two particle correlation in the
azimuthal angle is proposed to further clarify this issue.

observed weakness of gravity at long distances is due the existence of large

embedded in string theory. These models have a perturbative description in the
context of type I string theory. The gravitational sector consists of closed
strings propagating in the higher-dimensional bulk, while ordinary matter
consists of open strings living on D3-branes. This scenario raises the exciting
possibility that the LHC and NLC will experimentally study both ordinary
aspects of string physics such as the production of narrow Regge-excitations of
all standard model particles, as well more exotic phenomena involving strong
gravity such as the production of black holes. The new dimensions can be probed
by events with large missing energy carried off by gravitons escaping into the
bulk. We finally discuss some important issues of model building, such as
proton stability, gauge coupling unification and supersymmetry breaking.

still be practical.
  We give an NMR implementation in which the signal-to-noise ratio depends only
on features of NMR technology, not the size of the computer. This provides a
means for NMR computation techniques to scale to sizes at which the exponential
speedup enables quantum computation to solve problems beyond the capabilities
of classical computers.

partial differential equations, namely generalized Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers,
Korteveg-de Vries-Huxley, and Korteveg-de Vries-Burgers-Huxley equations, which
combine effects of diffusion, dispersion, and nonlinearity. We emphasize the
chiral behavior of the travelling solutions, whose velocities are determined by
the parameters that define the equation. For some appropriate choices, we show
that these equations can be mapped onto equations of motion of relativistic 1+1
dimensional phi^{4} and phi^{6} field theories of real scalar fields. We also
study systems of two coupled nonlinear equations of the types mentioned.
