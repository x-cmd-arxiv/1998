stars through very precise Doppler-shift measurements, the role of methods used
to analyze such observations has grown significantly. The widely employed
model-dependent approach based on the least-squares fit of the Keplerian motion
to the radial-velocity variations can be, as we show, unsatisfactory. Thus, in
this paper, we propose a new method that may be easily and successfully applied
to the Doppler-shift measurements. This method allows us to analyze the data
without assuming any specific model and yet to extract all significant features
of the observations. This very simple idea, based on the subsequent subtraction
of all harmonic components from the data, can be easily implemented. We show
that our method can be used to analyze real 16 Cygni B Doppler-shift
observations with a surprising but correct result which is substantially
different from that based on the least-squares fit of a Keplerian orbit.
Namely, using frequency analysis we show that with the current accuracy of this
star's observations it is not possible to determine the value of the orbital
eccentricity which is claimed to be as high as 0.6.

relations. The period - luminosity relation as a function of metallicity is
analysed and compared to the recent EROS observations in the Magellanic Clouds.
The models reproduce the observed width of the instability strips for the SMC

evolutionary timescales and a mass distribution given by a Salpeter mass
function. Excellent agreement is found with the SMC PL relationship determined
by Sasselov et al. (1997). The models reproduce the change of slope in the P-L
relationship near $P\sim 2.5$ days discovered recently by the EROS
collaboration (Bauer 1997; Bauer et al. 1998) and thus explain this feature in
term of stellar evolution. Some discrepancy, however, remains for the LMC
Cepheids. The models are also in good agreement with Beat Cepheids observed by
the MACHO and EROS collaborations. We show that most of the 1H/2H Beat Cepheids

and thermally stratified in the direction normal to the disk plane. We model
the vertical disk structure locally as a polytrope which represents a disk of
high optical depth. We solve the 3D gas-dynamic equations semi-analytically in
the neighborhood of a Lindblad resonance. These solutions match asymptotically
on to those valid away from resonances and provide solutions valid at all
radii. We obtain the following results. 1) A variety of waves are launched at
resonance. However, the f mode carries more than 95% of the torque exerted at
the resonance. 2) These 3D waves collectively transport exactly the amount of
angular momentum predicted by the 2D torque formula. 3) Near resonance, the f
mode occupies the full vertical extent of the disk. Away from resonance, the f
mode becomes confined near the surface of the disk, and, in the absence of
other dissipation mechanisms, damps via shocks. The radial length scale for
this process is roughly r_L/m (for resonant radius r_L and azimuthal wavenumber
m), independent of the disk thickness H. This wave channeling process is due to
the variations of physical quantities in r and is not due to wave refraction.
4) However, the inwardly propagating f mode launched from an m=2 inner Lindblad
resonance experiences relatively minor channeling.
  We conclude that for binary stars, tidally generated waves in highly
optically thick circumbinary disks are subject to strong nonlinear damping by
the channeling mechanism, while those in circumstellar accretion disks are
subject to weaker nonlinear effects. We also apply our results to waves excited
by young planets for which m is approximately r/H and conclude that the waves
are damped on the scale of a few H.

images (extracted from Digital Sky Survey) and spectra for these galaxies, are
presented in paper I (Wu et al., 1998). In this paper, we give the spectral and
morphological classifications for these very luminous IRAS galaxies (VLIRGs).
We show that about 60% of VLIRGs exhibit AGN-like spectra (Seyfert 1s, Seyfert
2s, LINER-like galaxies). This fraction goes up to 82% for the ultraluminous
IRAS galaxies (ULIRGs) subsample (Log(LIR/ Lsun) >= 12.0). 56% of the VLIRGs
show strong interaction or merging signa- tures; this fraction rises to 91% for
the ULIRGs. These statistical results strongly suggest that interaction
triggers nuclear activities and enhances the infrared luminosity. We find that
LINER and a mixture type which have optical properties of both HII galaxies and
LINERs could be at the transi- tion stage from infrared luminous HII galaxies
to AGNs; their main energy production is from starbursts as well as AGNs. Both
infrared luminosities and Ha equivalent widths increase dramatically as nuclear
separations between VLIRGs and their nearest neighbors decrease. There is
little doubt that strong starbursts happen in the nuclei of VLIRGs. Assuming
class 0 as advanced merger, we construct a simple merger sequence, from
morphological classes 1 to 4 (with near or far companions), to class 5 and 6
(interacting pairs and mergers) and then to class 0 (isolated galax- ies).
Along this sequence, VLIRGs evolve from HII galaxies to AGNs.

of the FP is essentially due to the non-homology in structure and kinematics of
elliptical galaxies and accordingly investigate structural and kinematical
properties of elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging with
star formation. We found that the rapidity of star formation, which is defined
as the ratio of dynamical time-scale of merger progenitor to the time-scale of
gas consumption by star formation, is a key determinant for nonhomology
parameters, such as the density profile of stellar component, the relative
importance of global rotation in kinematics, and the ratio of total dynamical
mass to luminous mass, in merger remnants. We furthermore found that this
result does not depend so strongly on initial intrinsic spins of progenitor
disks and orbital energy and angular momentum of mergers. These results
strongly suggest that the structural and kinematical nonhomology observed in
elliptical galaxies can be closely associated with the difference in star
formation history between elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy
merging. Based upon these results, we discuss a close physical relation between
the origin of the FP and the star formation history of elliptical galaxies.

625 +/- 18 and 820 +/- 19 Hz at its right end. The higher frequency peak's rms

145 +/- 62 Hz, respectively. The rms amplitude and FWHM of the lower peak were

was consistent with being constant at 325 +/- 10 Hz. Simultaneous with the kHz
QPOs we detected the horizontal branch oscillations (HBO) and its second

The normal branch oscillations were only detected on the upper and middle
normal branch, and became undetectable on the lower normal branch. The HBO
frequencies do not fall within the range predicted for Lense-Thirring (LT)
precession, unless either the ratio of the neutron star moment of inertia to
neutron star mass is at least 4, 10^45 gcm^2/M_sun, the frequencies of the HBO
are in fact the sub-harmonic oscillations, or the observed kHz peak difference
is half the spin frequency and not the spin frequency. During a 1.2 day gap
between two observations, the Z-track in the hardness-intensity diagram moved
to higher count rates by about 3.5%. Comparing data before and after this
shift, we find that the HBO properties are determined by position on the
Z-track and not directly by count rate or X-ray colors.

physically associated with the galaxy and that they are spatially extended.
Given their high intrinsic luminosities, these objects cannot be individual
stars. Using photometric evolution models we show that the objects constitute a
rich population of massive star clusters with ages ranging from a few Myr to 10
Gyr, and masses ranging from 10^4 to more than 10^7 solar masses. We show that
these objects are most likely globular clusters of varying age. There are peaks
in the age distribution of the clusters: at <30 Myr, ~100 Myr, ~600 Myr, 2.5-5
Gyr and ~10 Gyr. The youngest objects are found in the crowded starburst
region. The galaxy presently appears to be involved in a merger, which is the
probable cause of the present globular cluster formation. The presence of a
numerous intermediate age (2.5 to 5 Gyr) population of globular clusters,
suggests that a previous merger might have occurred. As the starburst fades,
this galaxy will become very rich in globular clusters. Transforming all
objects to an age comparable to that of Milky Way globular clusters reveals a
luminosity function similar to the Galactic. We suggest that this galaxy is the
result of a merger between a dwarf elliptical and a gas rich dwarf. The
possibility of dating the globular clusters offers an efficient way of studying
the history of violent star formation in this and similar galaxies.

the particles on a lattice. The parameter \gamma, the ratio of characteristic
time scales of reaction and diffusion, is used to gauge the relative
contributions of these two processes to the overall dynamics. For the case of
relatively fast diffusion, i.e. \gamma << 1, an approximate solution to the
Markov chain in the form of a perturbation expansion in powers of \gamma is
derived. Kinetic equations for the average concentrations differ from the
mass-action law and contain memory terms. For a reaction- diffusion system with
Willamowski-Rossler reaction mechanism, we further derive the following two
results: a) in the limit of \gamma --> 0 these memory terms vanish and the
mass-action law is recovered; b) the memory kernel is found to assume a simple
exponential form. A comparison with numerical results from lattice gas
automaton simulations is also carried out.

space dimensions $d<4$ is extended to systems with surfaces.This enables one to
study surface critical behavior directly in dimensions $d<4$ without having to
resort to the $\epsilon$ expansion. The approach is elaborated for the
representative case of the semi-infinite $|\bbox{\phi}|^4$ $n$-vector model
with a boundary term ${1/2} c_0\int_{\partial V}\bbox{\phi}^2$ in the action.
To make the theory uv finite in bulk dimensions $3\le d<4$, a renormalization
of the surface enhancement $c_0$ is required in addition to the standard mass
renormalization. Adequate normalization conditions for the renormalized theory
are given. This theory involves two mass parameter: the usual bulk `mass'
(inverse correlation length) $m$, and the renormalized surface enhancement $c$.
Thus the surface renormalization factors depend on the renormalized coupling
constant $u$ and the ratio $c/m$. The special and ordinary surface transitions
correspond to the limits $m\to 0$ with $c/m\to 0$ and $c/m\to\infty$,
respectively. It is shown that the surface-enhancement renormalization turns
into an additive renormalization in the limit $c/m\to\infty$. The
renormalization factors and exponent functions with $c/m=0$ and $c/m=\infty$
that are needed to determine the surface critical exponents of the special and
ordinary transitions are calculated to two-loop order. The associated series
expansions are analyzed by Pad\'e-Borel summation techniques. The resulting
numerical estimates for the surface critical exponents are in good agreement
with recent Monte Carlo simulations. This also holds for the surface crossover
exponent $\Phi$.

complicating the search for supersymmetry. The motivating reasons for high tau

$T({\bf R})$ of an associative unital ring ${\bf R}$ viewed as that of
fundamental representation for a universal enveloping Lie algebra and its
quantum deformations. We suggest a procedure of constructing twisting cocycles
belonging to a given quasitriangular subbialgebra ${\cal H}\subset T({\bf R})$.
This algorithm generalizes Reshetikhin's approach, which involves cocycles
fulfilling the Yang-Baxter equation. Within this framework we study a class of
quantized inhomogeneous Lie algebras related to associative rings in a certain
way, for which we build twisting cocycles and universal $R$-matrices. Our
approach is a generalization of the methods developed for the case of
commutative rings in our recent work including such well-known examples as
Jordanian quantization of the Borel subalgebra of $sl(2)$ and the null-plane
quantized Poincar\'e algebra by Ballesteros at al. We reveal the role of
special group cohomologies in this process and establish the bicrossproduct
structure of the examples studied.

(random point configurations) related to various systems of classical
orthogonal polynomials. The paper deals with a one--parametric deformation of
these ensembles, which is defined in terms of the biorthogonal polynomials of
Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite type.
  Our main result is a series of explicit expressions for the correlation
functions in the scaling limit (as the number of points goes to infinity). As
in the classical case, the correlation functions have determinantal form. They
are given by certain new kernels which are described in terms of the Wright's
generalized Bessel function and can be viewed as a generalization of the
well--known sine and Bessel kernels.
  In contrast to the conventional kernels, the new kernels are non--symmetric.
However, they possess other, rather surprising, symmetry properties.
  Our approach to finding the limit kernel also differs from the conventional
one, because of lack of a simple explicit Christoffel--Darboux formula for the
biorthogonal polynomials.

polymers or other objects interacting by some sort of exclusion condition. For
concreteness we develop it here for the case of Peierls contours. Unlike
existing methods, which are based on cluster-expansion formalisms and/or
complex analysis, our method is strictly probabilistic and hence can be applied
even in the absence of analyticity properties. It involves a Harris graphical
construction of a loss network for which the measure of interest is invariant.
The existence of the process and its mixing properties depend on the absence of
infinite clusters for a dual (backwards) oriented percolation process which we
dominate by a multitype branching process. Within the region of subcriticality
of this branching process the approach yields: (i) exponential convergence to
the equilibrium (=contour) measures, (ii) standard clustering and finite-effect
properties of the contour measure, (iii) a particularly strong form of the
central limit theorem, and (iv) a Poisson approximation for the distribution of
contours at low temperature.

(p,n) measurements. A large-basis shell model calculation reported here
indicates that the unusual situation they envisioned - destructive interference
between weak spin and strong spin-tensor amplitudes - does occur for the
transition to the first excited state in 71Ge. The calculation provides a
counterexample to procedures previously used to determine the 51Cr cross
section: the predicted (p,n) cross section for this state agrees with
experiment, while the BGT value is well outside the accepted
3-standard-deviation limit. The results argue for a shift in the interpretation
of the source experiments: they become more crucial as measurements of the 71Ga
detector response to 7Be solar neutrinos, and less definitive as wholly
independent tests of 71Ge recovery and counting efficiencies.
