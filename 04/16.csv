5300 seconds with the Berkeley spectrometer on the ORFEUS-SPAS II Mission in
1996 November-December. The resulting spectrum extends from the interstellar
cutoff at 912 A to ~ 1200 A at a resolution of ~ 0.33 A. It shows numerous
absorption features, both photospheric and interstellar, but no significant
emission other than diffuse emission of local origin. The Kurucz synthetic
stellar spectrum that best fits the data has T_eff = 21,000 K, log g = 3.0, and
[M/H] = -2.5. This effective temperature and surface gravity are consistent
with previous results, but the derived metallicity is lower than that of other
M13 giants, for which [Fe/H] = -1.60. Using high-resolution synthetic spectra,
we determine the photospheric abundances of C, S, and Fe, species unobservable
in the optical. We find log epsilon(C) = 6.15 +/- 0.10, log epsilon(S) = 5.34
+/- 0.50, and log epsilon(Fe) = 5.30 (+0.22, -0.26). Again, the Fe abundance is
lower than expected. This anomaly may reflect selective condensation of metals
onto dust grains at the end of the AGB phase, as has been suggested for some
cooler post-AGB stars with peculiar Fe abundances.

as a function of separation (or the two point correlation function of stars) in
star-forming regions. First, we consider the form of the functions for various
simple stellar distributions (binaries, global density profiles, clusters, and
fractals) and the effects of survey boundaries.
  Following this, we study the dependencies of the separation at which a
transition from the binary to the large-scale clustering regime occurs. Larson
(1995) found that the mean surface density of companions follows different
power-law functions of separation in the two regimes. He identified the
transition separation with the typical Jeans length in the molecular cloud.
However, we show that this is valid only for special cases. In general, the
transition separation depends on the volume density of stars, the depth of the
star-forming region, the volume-filling nature of the stellar distribution, and
on the parameters of the binaries. Furthermore, the transition separation
evolves with time.
  We then apply these results to the Taurus-Auriga, Ophiuchus, and Orion
Trapezium star-forming regions. We find that while the transition separation in
the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region may indicate a typical Jeans length, this
is not true of the Orion Trapezium Cluster. We also show that there is no
evidence for sub-clustering or fractal structure in the stars of the Orion
Trapezium Cluster. This is consistent with the fact that, if such structure
were present when the stars formed, it would have been erased by the current
age of the cluster due to the stellar velocity dispersion. [Abstract abridged]

stellar properties as a function of Z are mainly determined by the effects of
the opacities at sub-solar metallicities, and by the effects of the mean
molecular weight and stellar mass loss at higher metallicities. As a result,
very metal-rich stars (Z >~0.05) exhibit properties that deviate from what is
expected from the known characteristics at lower metallicities.
  In particular, they are more luminous and hotter than those at Z <~ 0.05 due
to the effect of the mean molecular weight. They have main sequence lifetimes
much shorter (60 % shorter at Z=0.1 than at Z=0.02) than those at solar
metallicity due to their lower initial hydrogen content. Finally, the high mass
loss rates at high metallicities affect significantly the population synthesis
of massive stars in very metal-rich regions. An analysis of expected Wolf-Rayet

few, if the scattering region is far from the GC and only a random

7' to 137' from Sgr A*. Our objective was to identify extragalactic sources and
measure their scattering diameters so as to constrain this ratio. In order to
find sources within these fields, we have employed pdfCLEAN, an algorithm in
which sources are identified in an image by comparing the intensity histogram
of the image to that expected from a noise-only image. We found over 100
sources, with the faintest sources being 3 mJy. The average number of sources
per field is approximately 10, though fields close to Sgr A* tend to contain
fewer sources. In a companion paper we use this survey in assessing the
likelihood that the scattering region is within the GC.

interacting limit and to order 1/V (V is the nearest-neighbor Coulomb
interaction), that the energy levels are flux independent. This leads to a zero
value for the curvature of levels D_n and, as consequence, to D(T)=0, proving
an earlier conjecture of Zotos and Prelov\v{s}ek.

attention to the role of their new components in the deuteron elastic and

currents. Straigthforward applications to the pion and nucleon form factors and

the four nucleon system. The results with an S-wave interaction model in the
isospin approximation are presented. They concern the bound and scattering
states below the first three-body threshold. The elastic phase-shifts for the
N+NNN reaction in different ($S,T$) channels are given and the corresponding
low energy expansions are discussed. Particular attention is payed to the n+t
elastic cross section. Its resonant structure is well described in terms of a
simple NN interaction. First results concerning the S-matrix for the coupled
N+NNN-NN+NN channels and the strong deuteron-deuteron scattering length are
obtained.

Fis. 44(4), 402-412 (1998).",,,"physics.ed-ph",,"  In this article we give an introduction to the Fock quantization of the
Maxwell field. At the classical level, we treat the theory in both the
covariant and canonical phase space formalisms. The approach is general since
we consider arbitrary (globally-hyperbolic) space-times. The Fock quantization
is shown to be equivalent to the definition of a complex structure on the
classical phase space. As examples, we consider stationary space-times as well
as ordinary Minkowski space-time. The account is pedagogical in spirit and is
tailored to beginning graduate students. The paper is selfcontained and is
intended to fill an existing gap in the literature.

the complexity associated with delayed dynamics. In this scheme, the encryption
process is a coupling dynamics with various time delays between different bits
in the original data. It is shown that decoding of the encrypted data is
extremely difficult without a complete knowledge of coupling manner with
associated delays for all bits of the data.

  Computer","12 pages, Presented at the 1st NASA conference on Quantum Computing
  and Quantum Communication",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A Quantum Computer is a new type of computer which can solve problems such as
factoring and database search very efficiently. The usefulness of a quantum
computer is limited by the effect of two different types of errors, decoherence
and inaccuracies. In this paper we show the results of simulations of a quantum
computer which consider both decoherence and inaccuracies. We simulate circuits
which factor the numbers 15, 21, 35, and 57 as well as circuits which use
database search to solve the circuit satisfaction problem. Our simulations show
that the error rate per gate is on the order of 10^-6 for a trapped ion quantum
computer whose noise is kept below pi/4096 per gate and with a decoherence rate
of 10^-6. This is an important bound because previous studies have shown that a
quantum computer can factor more efficiently than a classical computer if the
error rate is of order 10^-6.

"quant-ph/9804039","Kevin M. Obenland","Kevin M. Obenland and Alvin M. Despain","A Parallel Quantum Computer Simulator","22 pages, Presented at High Performance Computing 1998",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A Quantum Computer is a new type of computer which can efficiently solve
complex problems such as prime factorization. A quantum computer threatens the
security of public key encryption systems because these systems rely on the
fact that prime factorization is computationally difficult. Errors limit the
effectiveness of quantum computers. Because of the exponential nature of
quantum com puters, simulating the effect of errors on them requires a vast
amount of processing and memory resources. In this paper we describe a parallel
simulator which accesses the feasibility of quantum computers. We also derive
and validate an analytical model of execution time for the simulator, which
shows that parallel quantum computer simulation is very scalable.

  Title is changed",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The logic--linguistic structure of quantum physics is analysed. The role of
formal systems and interpretations in the representation of nature is
investigated. The problems of decidability, completeness, and consistency can
affect quantum physics in different ways. Bohr's complementarity is of great
interest,because it is a contradictory proposition. We shall see that the
flowing of time prevents the birth of contradictions in nature, because it
makes a cut between two different, but complementary aspects of the reality.
