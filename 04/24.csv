approach has the advantages that it can be applied to CCD objective prism

the subsequent reduction procedure is completely automatic, resulting in
fully-reduced, wavelength justified spectra. We also discuss a method of
removing stellar continua using a combination of non-linear filtering
algorithms.

investigate the complex X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3. We find
that the composite spectrum can be well described in terms of a heavily cut-off
hard X-ray continuum, iron K_alpha emission and a soft X-ray excess, with
spectral variability confined to changes in the continuum normalisation and the
flux in the iron line. Previous studies have suggested that the power-law
continuum in Mrk 3 is unusually hard. We obtain a canonical value for the
energy index of the continuum (i.e. alpha approx 0.7) when a warm absorber
(responsible for an absorption edge observed near 8 keV) is included in the
spectral model. Alternatively, the inclusion of a reflection component yields a
comparable power-law index. The soft-excess flux cannot be modelled solely in
terms of pure electron scattering of the underlying power-law continuum.
However, a better fit to the spectral data is obtained if we include the
effects of both emission and absorption in a partially photoionized scattering
medium. In particular the spectral feature prominent at $\sim 0.9$ keV could
represent O VIII recombination radiation produced in a hot photoionized medium.
We discuss our results in the context of other recent studies of the soft X-ray
spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies.

However, millisecond radio pulsars spin very rapidly even though many are
billions of years old. The most compelling explanation is that they have been
""spun up"" by the transfer of angular momentum during accretion of material from
a companion star in so-called low-mass X-ray binary systems, LMXBs. (LMXBs
consist of a neutron star or black hole accreting from a companion less than
one solar mass.) The recent detection of coherent X-ray pulsations with a
millisecond period from a suspected LMXB system appears to confirm this link.
Here we report observations showing that the orbital period of this binary
system is two hours, which establishes it as an LMXB. We also find an apparent
modulation of the X-ray flux at the orbital period (at the two per cent level),
with a broad minimum when the pulsar is behind this low-mass companion star.
This system seems closely related to the ""black widow"" millisecond radio
pulsars, which are evaporating their companions through irradiation. It may
appear as an eclipsing radio pulsar during periods of X-ray quiescence.

{\lq}telescope{\rq} on scales down to a few AU. For the purpose, X-ray
observations are most preferable, because X-rays originating from the innermost
regions, can be selectively amplified by microlensing due to the so-called
`caustic crossing'. If detected, X-ray variations will constrain the size of
the X-ray emitting region down to a few AU. The maximum attainable resolution
depends mainly on the monitoring intervals of lens events, which should be much
shorter than the crossing time. On the basis of this idea, we performe
numerical simulations of microlensing of an optically-thick, standard-type disk
as well as an optically-thin, advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF).
Calculated spectral variations and light curves show distinct behaviors,
depending on the photon energy. X-ray radiation which is produced in optically
thin region, exhibits intensity variation over a few tens of days. In contrast,
optical-UV fluxes, which are likely to come from optically thick region,
exhibit more gradual light changes, which is consistent with the microlensing
events so far observed in Q2237+0305.

and study the profiles of the Fe~K$\alpha$ lines. The motivation was the fact
that the Balmer lines of this object show well-separated displaced peaks,
suggesting an origin in an accretion disk. The 0.5-10 keV X-ray spectrum is
described very well by a model consisting of a power law of photon index 1.77
modified by interstellar photoelectric absorption. We find evidence for neither
a soft nor a hard (Compton reflection) excess. More importantly, we do not
detect an Fe K-alpha line, in marked contrast with the spectra of typical
Seyfert galaxies and other broad-line radio galaxies observed by ASCA. The
99%-confidence upper limit on the equivalent width of an unresolved line at a
rest energy of 6.4 keV is 100 eV, while for a broad line (FWHM of approximately
60,000 km/s) the corresponding upper limit is 135 eV. We discuss several
possible explanations for the weakness of the Fe K-alpha line in Pictor~A

K-alpha lines in other broad-line radio galaxies observed by ASCA. We speculate
that the absence of a hard excess (Compton reflection) or an Fe K-alpha line is

configurations past a Schwarzschild hole. We have analyzed and discussed the
flow morphology for a sample of asymptotically high Mach number models. The
results of this work reveal that initially asymptotic uniform flows always
accrete onto the hole in a stationary way which closely resembles the previous
axisymmetric patterns. This is in contrast with some Newtonian numerical
studies where violent flip-flop instabilities were found. As discussed in the
text, the reason can be found in the initial conditions used in the
relativistic regime, as they can not exactly duplicate the previous Newtonian
setups where the instability appeared. The dependence of the final solution
with the inner boundary condition as well as with the grid resolution has also
been studied. Finally, we have computed the accretion rates of mass and linear

Balmer lines, strong FeII emission, large and fast X-ray variability, rather
steep 2-10 keV spectrum. These intriguing objects have been suggested to be the
analogs of Galactic black hole candidates in the high, soft state. We present
here results from ASCA observations for two of these quasars: NAB0205+024 and
PG1244+026. Both objects show similar variations (factor of about 2 in 10 ks),
despite a factor of about ten difference in the 0.5-10 keV luminosity (7.3E43

flattens by 0.5-1 going from the 0.1-2 keV band toward higher energies,
strengthening recent results on another half dozen steep soft X-ray AGN.
PG1244+026 shows a significant feature in the `1 keV' region, which can be
described by either as a broad emission line centered at 0.95 keV (quasar
frame) or as edge or line absorption at 1.17 (1.22) keV. The line emission
could be due to reflection from an highly ionized accretion disk, in line with
the view that steep soft X-ray quasars are emitting close to the Eddington
luminosity. Photoelectric edge absorption or resonant line absorption could be
produced by gas outflowing at a large velocity (0.3-0.6 c).

solar internal rotation. New observational data of high quality obtained from
the Solar Heliospheric Satellite (SoHO) and from the Global Oscillations
Network Group (GONG), allow the determination of the internal rotation velocity
of the Sun as a function of radius and latitude with unprecedented spatial
resolution and accuracy. As a consequence, a number of global properties of the

quadrupole moment of the Sun. The anomalous precession of the orbit of Mercury

of which is that due to J_2. It is shown here that the data are currently

function of redshift is deduced from an observation-based determination of the

range of progenitor masses leading to black hole collapse. In this case, the
main features of the gravitational-wave emission spectra have been shown to be,
to some extent, independent of the initial conditions and of the equation of
state of the collapsing star, and to depend only on the black hole mass and
angular momentum. We calculate the overall signal produced by the ensemble of
black-hole collapses throughout the Universe, assuming a flat cosmology with
vanishing cosmological constant. Within a wide range of parameter values, we
find that the spectral strain amplitude has a maximum at a few hundred Hz with
an amplitude between $10^{-28}$ and $10^{-27} Hz^{-1/2}$; the corresponding
closure density, $\Omega_{GW}$, has a maximum amplitude ranging between
$10^{-11}$ and $10^{-10}$ in the frequency interval $\sim 1.5-2.5$ kHz.
Contrary to previous claims, our observation-based determination leads to a
duty cycle of order 0.01, making our stochastic backgound a non-continuous one.
Although the amplitude of our background is comparable to the sensitivity that
can be reached by a pair of advanced LIGO detectors, the characteristic
shot-noise structure of the predicted signal might be in principle exploited to
design specific detection strategies.

Rayleigh-Schr\""odinger perturbation theory in the rung and plaquette bases. We
formulate a method to extract high-order perturbative coefficients in the bulk
limit from solutions for relatively small finite clusters. For example, a
perturbative calculation for an isotropic $2\times 12$ ladder yields an
eleventh-order estimate of the ground-state energy per site that is within
0.02% of the density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) value. Moreover, the
method also enables a reliable estimate of the radius of convergence of the
perturbative expansion. We find that for the rung basis the radius of
convergence is $\lambda_c\simeq 0.8$, with $\lambda$ defining the ratio between
the coupling along the chain relative to the coupling across the chain. In
contrast, for the plaquette basis we estimate a radius of convergence of
$\lambda_c\simeq 1.25$. Thus, we conclude that the plaquette basis offers the
only currently available perturbative approach which can provide a reliable
treatment of the physically interesting case of isotropic $(\lambda=1)$ spin
ladders. We illustrate our methods by computing perturbative coefficients for
the ground-state energy per site, the gap, and the one-magnon dispersion
relation.

that there is no expansion in powers of $(6-d)$, or that the transition is

equation describing the time evolution of the number of empty sites in front of
each car, the concepts of inter-car spacings longer and shorter than $M$ are
introduced. The probabilities of having long and short spacings on the road are
calculated. For high car densities $(\rho \geq 1/M)$, it is shown that
inter-car spacings longer than $M$ will be shortened as the traffic flow
evolves in time, and any initial configurations approach a steady state in
which all the inter-car spacings are of the short type. Similarly for low car
densities $(\rho \leq 1/M)$, it can be shown that traffic flow approaches an
asymptotic steady state in which all the inter-car spacings are longer than
$M-2$. The average traffic speed is then obtained analytically as a function of
car density in the asymptotic steady state. The fundamental diagram so obtained
is in excellent agreement with simulation data.

Euclidean quantum gravity is presented. The fields in this classical theory are
those of SO(4) BF theory, a simple topological theory of an so(4) valued 2-form
field, $B^{IJ}_{\m\n}$, and an so(4) connection. The left handed (self-dual)
and right handed (anti-self-dual) components of $B$ define a left handed and a,
generally distinct, right handed area for each spacetime 2-surface. The theory
being presented is obtained by adding to the BF action a Lagrange multiplier
term that enforces the constraint that the left handed and the right handed
areas be equal. It is shown that Euclidean general relativity (GR) forms a
sector of the resulting theory. The remaining three sectors of the theory are
also characterized and it is shown that, except in special cases, GR canonical
initial data is sufficient to specify the GR sector as well as a specific
solution within this sector.
  Finally, the path integral quantization of the theory is discussed at a
formal level and a hueristic argument is given suggesting that in the
semiclassical limit the path integral is dominated by solutions in one of the
non-GR sectors, which would mean that the theory quantized in this way is not a
quantization of GR.

B1 metrics can be extended through the horizon only for discrete values of mass

nuclear physics. Recently, a similar effect was discovered in other finite
fermion systems, such as ultrasmall metallic grains and metal clusters. It is
believed that the staggering in nuclei and grains is primarily due to pairing
correlations (superconductivity), while in clusters it is caused by the
Jahn-Teller effect. We find that, for light and medium-mass nuclei, the
staggering has two components. The first one originates from pairing while the
second, comparable in magnitude, has its roots in the deformed mean field.

presented.
