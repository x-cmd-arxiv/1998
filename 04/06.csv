(LSB) differ from ordinary galaxies simply because they form in halos with
large spin parameters. We compute star formation rates using the Schmidt law,
assuming the same gas infall dependence on surface density as used in models of
the Milky Way. We build stellar population models, predicting colours, spectra,
and chemical abundances. We compare our predictions with observed values of
metallicity and colours for LSB galaxies and find excellent agreement with all
observables. In particular, integrated colours, colour gradients, surface
brightness and metallicity match very well to the observed values of LSBs for
models with ages larger than 7 Gyr and high values ($\lambda > 0.05$) for the
spin parameter of the halos. We also compute the global star formation rate
(SFR) in the Universe due to LSBs and show that it has a flatter evolution with
redshift than the corresponding SFR for normal discs. We furthermore compare
the evolution in redshift of $[Zn/H]$ for our models to those observed in
Damped Lyman $\alpha$ systems by \scite{Pettini+97} and show that Damped Lyman
$\alpha$ systems abundances are consistent with the predicted abundances at
different radii for LSBs. Finally, we show how the required late redshift of
collapse of the halo may constrain the power spectrum of fluctuations.

to the system moving with a velocity beta (= v/c) with respect to the cosmic
microwave background radiation. In the present formalism, the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for the cluster of galaxies with a peculiar velocity
is derived in a straightforward manner by the Lorentz boost of the generalized
Kompaneets equation. We give an analytic expression for the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect which is valid up to O(beta^{2}) with the power
series expansion approximation in terms of theta_{e} = k_{B} T_{e}/ mc^{2},
where T_{e} and m are the electron temperature and the electron mass,
respectively. It is found that the relativistic corrections to the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect are significant. For a typical electron temperature
10keV, one obtains -8.2% and +1.3% corrections from the O(beta theta_{e}) and
O(beta theta_{e}^{2}) contributions, respectively. The O(beta^{2}) correction
is extremely small, +0.2% for beta=1/300 at 10keV. Therefore it can be safely
neglected. These relativistic corrections are directly reflected on the
determination of the peculiar velocity of the cluster of galaxies with the
observation of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

for the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are integrated for a
set of values of the cosmological parameters. For all the considered models we
assume a scale-invariant primeval spectrum. The density weighted final linear
power spectra are normalized to the four year COBE data and have been used to
constrain the parameter space by a comparison of linear predictions with the
current observational data on large scales. The consistency of MLM predictions
with the observable data set is best obtained for models with one specie of
massive neutrinos and $\Omega_H/\Omega_M \le0.2$. For this class of MLM models
we obtain constraints from linear data on the present matter density.
Consistency with the estimated cluster abundance can be achieved for COBE
normalized MLM models with $\Omega_H/\Omega_M\le0.2$ and $ 0.45 \le \Omega_M

constraints are at $1\sigma$ level and standard MDM models are clearly ruled
out. We note that the range of allowed values for $\Omega_M$, that we obtain
for MLM models from linear analysis, is also approximately the same range that
is needed in order to consistently satisfy a variety of independent
observational constraints.

significant episodes of star formation at about 15 Gyr, 7 Gyr, and 3 Gyr.
Contrary to the generic picture of galaxy evolution, however, the bulk of star
formation, at least 50%, occured during the episode 7 Gyr ago, which may have
lasted as long as 2 Gyr. For unknown reasons, Carina formed only 10-20% of its
stars at an ancient epoch and then remained quiescent for more than 4 Gyr. The
remainder (~30%) formed relatively recently, only 3 Gyr ago. Interest in the
local population of dwarf galaxies has increased lately due to their potential
importance in the understanding of faint galaxy counts. We surmise that objects
like Carina, which exhibits the most extreme episodic behavior of any of the
dwarf spheroidal companions to the Galaxy, are capable of contributing to the
observed excess of blue galaxies at B = 24 only if the star formation occurred

reliably analyzed and the pure $A_{1g} $ contribution can be easily identified.
Below the critical temperature $T_{c}, $ two electronic structures at $2\Delta

Both are observed simultaneously in pure $A_{1g} $ symmetry, the highest energy
one being located at the energy of the $B_{1g} $ maximum. These two maxima
disappear at $T_{c} $ and do not soften significantly as the temperature is
raised up to $T_{c}. $ The low energy frequency dependence of the $B_{1g} $

476.5 to 647.1 nm range. Such experimental data cannot be reconciled with a
pure $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} $ symmetry. Instead, they strongly advocate in favor of
an anisotropic superconducting gap with two distinct gap maxima and of nodes
existing outside the [110] and [1,$\bar{1}$,0] directions in {\bf k}-space. We
discuss in detail the simplest order parameter compatible with our experimental

correlations is one of the prominent problems in metallic local moment systems.
As standard models for such systems, the SU(N) x SU(M) Anderson impurity models
exhibit both Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid behavior, depending on their
symmetry. Using an auxiliary boson method, we present a generally applicable
scheme to select the relevant contributions in the low frequency regime, while
preserving the local gauge symmetry of the model. It amounts to a conserving
T-matrix approximation (CTMA) including coherent spin flip as well as charge
fluctuation processes, which are found to dominate in the Kondo and in the
mixed valence regime, respectively. The infrared threshold exponents of the
auxiliary particle spectral functions are indicators for the presence of Fermi
or non-Fermi liquid behavior in any given model with strong on-site repulsion.
We show that, in contrast to earlier auxiliary boson theories, the CTMA
recovers the correct exponents in both cases, indicating that it correctly
describes both the Fermi and the non-Fermi regimes of the Anderson model.

including both the frequency and the amplitude modulations. We include the
effects of the intrinsic frequency changes and the modulation of the frequency
at the detector due to the Earth motion. We estimate the effects of the star's
proper motion and of relativistic corrections. Moreover we consider a signal
consisting of two components corresponding to a frequency $f$ and twice that
frequency. From the maximum likelihood principle we derive the detection
statistics for the signal and we calculate the probability density function of
the statistics. We obtain the data analysis procedure to detect the signal and
to estimate its parameters. We show that for optimal detection of the amplitude
modulated signal we need four linear filters instead of one linear filter
needed for a constant amplitude signal. Searching for the doubled frequency
signal increases further the number of linear filters by a factor of two. We
indicate how the fast Fourier transform algorithm and resampling methods
commonly proposed in the analysis of periodic signals can be used to calculate
the detection statistics for our signal. We find that the probability density
function of the detection statistics is determined by one parameter: the
optimal signal-to-noise ratio. We study the signal-to-noise ratio by means of
the Monte Carlo method for all long-arm interferometers that are currently
under construction. We show how our analysis can be extended to perform a joint
search for periodic signals by a network of detectors and we perform Monte

  From generic initial conditions of this spherically symmetric collapse, there
appears a naked singularity at the symmetric center in the course of the
gravitational collapse of the dust cloud. So this might be a counter example to
the cosmic censorship hypothesis. To investigate the genericity of this
example, we examine the stability of the `nakedness' of this singularity
against odd-parity modes of non-spherical linear perturbations for the metric,
i.e., linear gravitational waves. We find that the perturbations do not diverge

This means that the naked singularity formation process is marginally stable

superconductivity: the spontaneous breaking of color symmetry via the formation

transition is second order in the chiral limit and is a smooth crossover for
nonzero current quark mass. A tricritical point separates the first order
transition at high densities from the second order transition at high

theory emerging out of compactified heterotic string theory are constructed by
making use of the well-known duality symmetries. Beginning with
four-dimensional solutions of the Einstein-massless scalar field theory in the
canonical frame we first rewrite the corresponding solutions in the string
frame. Thereafter, using the T and S duality symmetries of the low energy
string effective action we arrive at the corresponding uncharged, electrically
charged and magnetically charged solutions. Brief comments on the construction
of dual versions of the Kerr-Sen type using the dilatonic Kerr solution as the
seed are also included. Thereafter, we verify the status of the energy
conditions for the solutions in the string frame. Several of the metrics found
here are shown to possess naked singularities although the energy conditions
are obeyed. Dual solutions exhibit a duality in the conservation/violation of
the Null and Averaged Null Energy Conditions (NEC/ANEC), a fact demonstrated
earlier in the context of black holes (hep-th/9604047) and cosmologies
(hep-th/9611122). Additionally, those backgrounds which conserve the NEC/ANEC
in spite of possesing naked singularities serve as counterexamples to cosmic
censorship in the context of low energy, effective string theory.

affine Kac-Moody algebras. They provide strong evidence for the consistency of
an infinite list of heterotic Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field

chirality (exchanges left and right movers) and takes the level-rank dual. We
compare the dual-flip to the method of conformal subalgebras, another way of
constructing heterotic invariants. To do so, new level-one heterotic invariants
are first found; the complete list of a specified subclass of these is
obtained. We also prove (under a mild hypothesis) an old conjecture concerning
exceptional $A_{r,k}$ invariants and level-rank duality.

for the partition function of the London limit of Abelian Higgs Model with an
additional axionic term. In the lowest order of perturbation theory, this term
leads to the appearance in the resulting string effective action of a new
threelocal interaction between the elements of the string world-sheet.
Consequently, there emerges a threelocal correlator of the dual field strength
tensors, which does not contain the average over world-sheets, and is therefore
nontrivial even in the sector of the theory with a single small vortex. The
relation between the obtained correlator and the bilocal one is established.
Finally, it is argued that the vacuum structure of the London limit of the
Abelian Higgs Model with an additional axionic interaction is much more similar
to that of gluodynamics rather than without this interaction.

of optimal quantum codes for preventing collective amplitude damping to a

protect one bit quantum information, and approximately $L+ 1/2 \log_2((\pi

For preventing collective amplitude damping, these codes are much more
