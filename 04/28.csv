non-detection of multiple images in the BATSE 4B catalog implies an upper limit
on the average redshift <z> of GRBs. Here, we calculate an upper limit to <z>,
independent of the physical model for GRBs, using a new statistical lensing
method that removes distance ambiguities, and thus permits accurate computation
of the lensing rate at high z. The upper limit on <z> depends directly on the
cosmological parameters Omega and Lambda. If there are no multiple images among
the brightest 80% of the first 1802 bursts in the BATSE 4B catalog, then, at
the 95% confidence level, <z> is less than 2.2, 2.8, 4.3, or 5.3 for
(Omega,Lambda) values of (0.3, 0.7), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.0), or (1.0, 0.0),
respectively. The 68% upper limit to the average redshift is comparable to or
less than the median redshift of GRBs in scenarios in which the GRB rate is
proportional to the rate of star formation, for any cosmology. The uncertainty
in the lensing rate --- arising from uncertainties in the cosmological
parameters and in the number density and average velocity dispersion of
galaxies --- will be reduced significantly in the next few years by a new
generation of experiments and surveys. Moreover, the continued increase in the
number of GRBs observed by BATSE will greatly constrain their redshift

of the application of the Fourier Slice Theorem to the general case where the

based on an extrapolation of the image Fourier transform into the so-called
cone of ignorance. The method is specifically designed for the deprojection of
X-ray, Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and gravitational lensing maps of rich clusters
of galaxies. For known values of the Hubble constant, H0, and inclination
angle, the quality of the projection depends on how exact is the extrapolation
in the cone of ignorance. In the case where the axis of symmetry is
perpendicular to the line of sight and the image is noise-free, the
deprojection is exact. Given an assumed value of H0, the inclination angle can
be found by matching the deprojected structure out of two different images of a
given cluster, e.g., SZ and X-ray maps. However, this solution is degenerate
with respect to its dependence on the assumed H0, and a third independent image
of the given cluster is needed to determine H0 as well. The application of the
deprojection algorithm to upcoming SZ, X-ray and weak lensing projected mass
images of clusters will serve to determine the structure of rich clusters, the
value of H0, and place constraints on the physics of the intra-cluster gas and
its relation to the total mass distribution.

with the Keck 10-meter telescopes. Based on these observations, CL0023+0423 has
a galaxy population which is more similar to groups of galaxies and the field.
This system is almost completely dominated by spiral galaxies. CL1604+4304,
however, has a morphological composition which is more typical of a normal,
present-day cluster; early-type galaxies comprise approximately 76% of all
galaxies brighter than M_V = -19.0 + 5 log h in the central 0.5 h^{-1} Mpc. The
ratio of S0 galaxies to ellipticals in this cluster is 1.7 +/- 0.9, consistent

a possible explanation for this result. We have measured radial velocities of
two groups of Praesepe stars (a dF-dK sample and a dM sample) and have measured
H$\alpha$ as a chromospheric activity index for the dM sample. We conclude that
the Praesepe catalog used in the X-ray analysis does not contain a significant
number of non-members. The comparison of the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths for
the M dwarfs in Praesepe with those in the Hyades indicates that, at least for
stars in this mass range, the Praesepe stars are as active or more active than
their Hyades counterparts. We have also analyzed a few ROSAT PSPC pointings of
Praesepe in order to obtain a new and independent estimate of the X-ray
luminosities and upper limits for a small sample of Praesepe members concluding
that the small differences between the old and new upper limits are not large
enough to explain the dichotomy in the X-ray properties of Praesepe and the
Hyades. Therefore, our examination of the available data does not provide a
clear reason to explain why the X-ray luminosity functions of the two clusters
are different. Part of the explanation could be found in the binaries.
Speculatively, these clusters could have different orbital period
distributions, with more short period binaries among the Hyades, which would
show larger coronal activity.

radiation and matter is treated self-consistently, taking into account
departures from LTE for calculating both the disk structure and the radiation
field. The structural equations are described in detail, and various
approximations are discussed. We have demonstrated that departures from LTE are
very important for determining the disk structure, even at the midplane, as
well as the emergent radiation, particularly for hot and electron--scattering--
dominated disks. We have shown that at least for the disk parameters studied in
this paper, NLTE effects tend to reduce the value of the Lyman jump with
respect to the LTE predictions, regardless whether LTE predicts an emission or
absorption jump. We have studied the effects of various values of viscosity on
the model structure and predicted spectral energy distribution. The viscosity
is parameterized through a parameter $\alpha_0$ which describes the
vertically-averaged viscous stress, two power-law exponents $\zeta_0$ and
$\zeta_1$, and the division point $m_{d}$ between these two forms. The disk
structure and emergent radiation is sensitive mainly to the values of
$\alpha_0$, while the other parameters influence the disk structure to a much
lesser extent. However, although the detailed shape of the predicted spectrum
is sensitive to adopted value of $\alpha_0$, the overall appearance of the
spectrum is quite similar.

two-temperature (sigma_xi << 1) and cooling flow (sigma_xi ~1) models is

accurately a cooling flow spectrum over 0.5-10 keV.

the Centaurus cluster, and the Perseus cluster. K-alpha emission line blends of
Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe are detected in each system as is significant Fe K-beta

Consideration of both the ratios of H-like to He-like K-alpha lines and the
local continuum temperatures clearly rules out isothermal gas in each case. To
obtain more detailed constraints we fitted plasma models over 1.6-9 keV where
the emission is dominated by these K shell lines and by continuum. In each case
the ASCA spectra cannot determine whether the gas emits at only two
temperatures or over a continuous range of temperatures as expected for a

range with a single power law and free absorption yields values of NH larger
than the Galactic ones. In most of these cases, however, broken power law fits
with NH fixed at the Galactic values yield an alternative, better description
of the data and indicate a steepening of the spectrum with increasing energy.
One object (1ES1101-232) is detected up to ~100 keV. Its spectral energy
distribution (SED) peaks in the medium energy X-ray band. For each object we
compute the peak frequency of the SED from multifrequency data. The spectral
indices alpha_x in the 2-10 keV band (Fnu prop to nu^{-alpha_x}) are smaller
(i.e. flatter spectrum) for objects with higher peak frequencies. We therefore
confirm and extend to higher energies the behavior already known for X-ray
selected BL Lac objects in the ROSAT band. We do not find spectral indices
smaller than 1; however, the flat distribution of alpha_x and the correlation
between alpha_x and peak frequency found from our data suggest that a number of
objects may exist, which in the quiescent status have flatter spectrum and peak
frequency in the hard X-ray range.

scenarios for these extreme colours: (i) these distant galaxies have formed
virtually all their stars at very high redshifts and, due to the absence of
recently formed stars, the colours are extremely red and (ii) these distant
galaxies contain large amounts of dust, severely reddening the rest-frame

a clear example of a high-redshift galaxy where the star formation rate

of the Bardeen-Hill-Lindner (BHL) approach based on the renormalization group
equation (RGE), with QCD plus Higgs loop effects included (m_t \simeq 205 GeV).

results from the treatment of the composite Higgs propagator, or more
precisely, of Z_H^{-1}. Our results can be summarized as m_t (Ours) \simeq

can be mapped to Riemann surfaces. Physically, the computations amount to
non-trivial tests of the basic F-theory -- heterotic duality in eight
dimensions. Mathematically, they mean to associate holomorphic 5-point

calculation for the structure of the initial and final nucleus. A computational
error in a previous report is rectified. It is shown that a proper treatment of
center-of-mass motion does not lead to a reduction of the spectroscopic factor
for $p$-shell quasi-hole states, but rather to a 7% enhancement. This is in
agreement with analytical results obtained in the harmonic oscillator model.
The center-of-mass effect worsens the discrepancy between present theoretical
models and the experimentally observed single-particle strength. We discuss the
present status of this problem, including some other mechanisms that may be
relevant in this respect.

makes the energy transfer between them very inefficient. We show that under
suitable scalings the LBE reduces, in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$, to a formally
exact equation for the speed (energy) and position distribution of the
electrons which contains mixed spatial and speed derivatives. When the system
is spatially homogeneous this equation reduces to and thus justifies, for
