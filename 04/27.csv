  (1998)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  It is suggested in this paper that the `bare' strange star might be not bare,
and there could be a magnetosphere around it. As a strange star might be an
intensely magnetized rotator, the induced unipolar electric field would be
large enough to construct a magnetosphere around the strange matter core.
  This kind of magnetosphere is very similar to that of the rotating magnetized
neutron stars discussed by many authors. A magnetosphere will be established
very soon through pair production by gamma-B or two photon processes after a
strange star was born in a supernova explosion. It is emphasized that the fact
that the strange star surface can not supply charged particles does not stop
the formation of a space charge separated magnetosphere around the bare strange
star. An accretion crust is quite difficult to come into being around an
isolated strange star. Therefore the observed radio signals of an
rotation-powered pulsar may come from a bare strange stars rather than a
neutron stars or a strange star with an accretion crust. The idea, that the
radio pulsars are the strange stars without crusts, is supported by some
observations. The fact, that the iron emission lines have been observed in many
X-ray pulsars but never been reported in X-ray emission of radio pulsars, is
difficult to be understood if the radio pulsars are the neutron stars or
strange star with crust where the surface binding energy of iron ions is too
low to avoid a ion free-flow from the surface.

is almost fully ionized can reveal the character of cosmological ionizing
sources. In this talk I will discuss the implications for rival reionization
scenarios of the rapid decline observed in the space density of quasars and
star-forming galaxies at redshifts z>3. The hydrogen component in a highly
inhomogeneous universe is completely reionized when the number of ionizing
photons emitted in one recombination time equals the mean number of hydrogen
atoms. At z=5, the local character of the UV metagalactic flux allows one to
define a critical emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons per unit comoving
volume. Models based on photoionization by bright QSOs and/or young galaxies
with star formation rates in excess of 0.3-1 M_sun/yr appear to fail to provide
the required number of hydrogen-ionizing photons at these redshifts by large
factors. If stellar sources are responsible for keeping the universe ionized at
z=5, the rate of star formation per unit comoving volume at this epoch must be
comparable or greater than observed at z=3.

892 new redshifts for galaxies with R <= 23.3. The data will also serve as deep
probes of the foreground and background large-scale structures. The
observations include broad band optical imaging and spectroscopy with the Low

obtain morphological information. We have established that six of the nine
cluster candidates are indeed real space density enhancements and are
representative of those typically associated with clusters of galaxies. The
remaining three candidates appear to be projections of several smaller groups
at widely separated distances. This success rate is consistent with estimates
of the false positive rate in 2D optical high-z cluster searches.

previous treatments of optimality in computational linguistics, starting with
Ellison (1994), the new approach does not require any explicit marking and
counting of constraint violations. It is based on the notion of ""lenient
composition,"" defined as the combination of ordinary composition and priority
union. If an underlying form has outputs that can meet a given constraint,
lenient composition enforces the constraint; if none of the output candidates
meet the constraint, lenient composition allows all of them. For the sake of
greater efficiency, we may ""leniently compose"" the GEN relation and all the
constraints into a single finite-state transducer that maps each underlying
form directly into its optimal surface realizations, and vice versa, without
ever producing any failing candidates. Seen from this perspective, optimality
theory is surprisingly similar to the two older strains of finite-state
phonology: classical rewrite systems and two-level models. In particular, the
ranking of optimality constraints corresponds to the ordering of rewrite rules.

Additionally, the range of the kernel describing the non-locality is strongly
temperature-dependent in this case. In the diffusive limit we find a cross-over
from local to non-local screening, which restricts the applicability of the

generally that a (very) generic hypersurface of sufficiently high degree in
projective space is hyperbolic (here, the terminology ""very generic"" refers to
complements of countable unions of proper algebraic subsets). Our technique
follows the stream of ideas initiated by Green and Griffiths in 1979, which
consists in considering jet differentials and their associated base loci.
However, a key ingredient is the use of a different kind of jet bundles, namely
the ""Semple jet bundles"" previously studied by the first named author (Santa
Cruz Summer School, July 1995, Proc. Symposia Pure Math., Vol. 62.2, 1997). The
base locus calculation is achieved through a sequence of Riemann-Roch formulas
combined with a suitable generic vanishing theorem for order 2-jets. Our method
covers the case of surfaces of general type with Picard group ${\Bbb Z}$ and
$(13+12\theta_2) c_1^2 - 9 c_2 > 0$, where $\theta_2$ is what we call the
""2-jet threshold"" (the 2-jet threshold turns out to be bounded below by -1/6
