sources (also known as embedded sources and protostars) in the Taurus-Auriga
dark cloud. We detect 10 of the 24 known class I sources in the cloud at
5500-9000 A. All detected class I sources have strong H-alpha emission; most
also have strong [O I] and [S II] emission. These data - together with high
quality optical spectra of T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga cloud -
demonstrate that forbidden emission lines are stronger and more common in class
I sources than in T Tauri stars. Our results also provide a clear discriminant
in the frequency of forbidden line emission between weak-emission and classical
T Tauri stars. In addition to strong emission lines, three class I sources have
prominent TiO absorption bands. The M-type central stars of these sources
mingle with optically visible T Tauri stars in the HR diagram and lie somewhat
below both the birthline for spherical accretion and the deuterium burning
sequence for disc accretion.

  Our evolution code simulates planetesimal growth in a single annulus and
includes velocity evolution but not fragmentation. Test results match analytic
solutions and duplicate previous simulations at 1 AU.
  In the Kuiper Belt, simulations without velocity evolution produce a single
runaway body with a radius of 1000 km on a time scale inversely proportional to
the initial mass in the annulus. Runaway growth occurs in 100 Myr for 10 earth
masses and an initial eccentricity of 0.001 in a 6 AU annulus centered at 35
AU. This mass is close to the amount of dusty material expected in a minimum
mass solar nebula extrapolated into the Kuiper Belt.
  Simulations with velocity evolution produce runaway growth on a wide range of
time scales. Dynamical friction and viscous stirring increase particle
velocities in models with large (8 km radius) initial bodies. This velocity
increase delays runaway growth by a factor of two compared to models without
velocity evolution. In contrast, collisional damping dominates over dynamical
friction and viscous stirring in models with small (80--800 m radius) initial
bodies. Collisional damping decreases the time scale to runaway growth by
factors of 4--10 relative to constant velocity calculations. Simulations with
minimum mass solar nebulae, 10 earth masses, reach runaway growth on time
scales of 20-40 Myr with 80 m initial bodies, 50-100 Myr with 800 m bodies, and
75-250 Myr for 8 km initial bodies. These growth times vary linearly with the
mass of the annulus but are less sensitive to the initial eccentricity than
constant velocity models.

model the reversible photoinduced magnetization. Implications of the calculated
results are discussed in relation to the recent experimental results for
prussian blue analogs.

infinite-dimensional simplex (the Thoma simplex). These measures originate in
harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group (S.Kerov, G.Olshanski and
A.Vershik, Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. Paris I 316 (1993), 773-778). Our approach
is to interpret them as probability distributions on a space of point
configurations, i.e., as certain point stochastic processes, and to find the
correlation functions of these processes.
  In the present paper we relate the correlation functions to the solutions of
certain multidimensional moment problems. Then we calculate the first
correlation function which leads to a conclusion about the support of the
initial measures. In the appendix, we discuss a parallel but more elementary
theory related to the well-known Poisson-Dirichlet distribution.
  The higher correlation functions are explicitly calculated in the subsequent
paper (A.Borodin, math.RT/9804087). In the third part (A.Borodin and
G.Olshanski, math.RT/9804088) we discuss some applications and relationships
with the random matrix theory.
  The goal of our work is to understand new phenomena in noncommutative
harmonic analysis which arise when the irreducible representations depend on
countably many continuous parameters.

integral representation of all the correlation functions and their explicit

modification (``lifting'') of the processes which results in a substantial
simplification of the structure of the correlation functions. It turns out that
the ``lifted'' correlation functions are given by a determinantal formula
involving a kernel. The latter has the form (A(x)B(y)-B(x)A(y))/(x-y), where A
and B are certain Whittaker functions. Such a form for correlation functions is
well known in the random matrix theory and mathematical physics. Finally, we
get some asymptotic formulas for the correlation functions which are employed
in Part III (A.Borodin and G.Olshanski, math.RT/9804088).

object for the infinite symmetric group. Our approach is based on studying the
correlation functions of certain related point stochastic processes.
  In the present paper we consider the so-called tail point processes which
describe the limit behavior of the Thoma parameters (coordinates on the Thoma
simplex) with large numbers. The tail processes turn out to be stationary
processes on the real line. Their correlation functions have determinantal form
with a kernel which generalizes the well-known sine kernel arising in random
matrix theory. Our second result is a law of large numbers for the Thoma
parameters. We also produce Sturm-Liouville operators commuting with the
Whittaker kernel introduced in Part II and with the generalized sine kernel.
