angular-dependent energy gap along the field direction the neutrino emissivity
is only suppressed polynomially as function in $T/T_{c}$ instead of
exponentially, as it is obtained for a nodeless pairing state. The effect of
this pairing state on the thermal evolution of neutron stars is studied, and
its outcome is compared with the evolution of ``normal'', i.e. nodeless,
superfluid and non-superfluid neutron stars, and also with observations. We
find that particularly the predicted surface temperatures of the enhanced
cooling scenario considerably change and come into agreement with temperatures
deduced from observational data within the hydrogen atmosphere model.
Furthermore the surface temperature depends on the magnetic field strength as
an additional parameter aside from the neutron star mass. The latter is however
only operative in the case of the intermediate cooling scenario.

  Letters",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1998.01672.x",,"astro-ph",,"  The nuclei of a wide class of active galaxies emit broad emission lines with
widths at half maximum (FWHM) in the range $10^{3}-10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$. This
spread of widths is not solely a consequence of the range of the luminosities
of these sources since a plot of width versus luminosity shows a large scatter.
We propose that the broad line emission region (BLR) is axially symmetric and
that this scatter in line width arises from an additional dependence on the
angle of the line of sight to the axis of the emission region. Such a relation
is natural in unified models of active nuclei which link a variety of observed
properties to viewing angle. Adopting a simple form for the line width as a
function of luminosity and angle, and convolving this with the observed
luminosity function, allows us to predict a line width distribution consistent
with the available data. Furthermore, we use the relation between the
equivalent width of a line and the luminosity in the continuum (the `Baldwin
Effect') to predict an observed correlation between line width and equivalent
width. The scatter on this correlation is again provided by angular dependence.
The results have applications as diagnostics of models of the broad line
emission region and in cosmology.

A(q,\omega) which presents a flat quasiparticle dispersion at the chemical

existence of strong pairing fluctuations, which themselves are correlated with

there are states for which the Bethe momenta $k_n$ diverge: these are in fact

wavefunction, too, diverge. When there are only two down spins in the system
(the case considered by Bethe), we can renormalize these coefficients to get a
sensible (and correct) wavefunction. We show that this is not always possible
when there are more than two down spins. The Bethe equations have several such
divergent solutions, and some of these correspond to genuine eigenfunctions of
the Hamiltonian, but several do not. Nor do they reproduce the correct energy
eigenvalues. Moreover, we point out that the algebraic Bethe ansatz, an
alternative way to construct the wavefunctions proposed by Faddeev, Takhtajan
et al., leads to vanishing wavefunctions for all these solutions. Thus, the
Bethe ansatz solution of the Heisenberg model must be regarded as either

gluon is induced by the MA gauge fixing. In the MA gauge, there appears the
global network of the monopole world-line covering the whole system, which
would be identified as monopole condensation at a large scale. To prove
monopole condensation, we apply the dual gauge formalism to the monopole part,
and derive the inter-monopole potential from the dual Wilson loop in the MA
gauge. In the monopole part, which carries the nonperturbative aspects of QCD,
the dual gluon mass is evaluated as $m_B \simeq $0.5GeV, which is the evidence
of the dual Higgs mechanism by monopole condensation. As for the monopole
structure, the large fluctuation of off-diagonal gluons remains around the
monopole in the MA gauge, and large cancellation occurs between the diagonal
and off-diagonal action densities to keep the total QCD action finite. The
charged-gluon rich region around the QCD-monopole would provide the effective

are expected to appear in the charged-gluon rich region around the monopole

monopoles and instantons.

the mixings between the down-type quarks and colored Higgses, both of which are

16O(\gamma,pp)14C knockout reactions are calculated for transitions to the
low-lying discrete final states of the residual nucleus in the photon-energy
range between 100 and 400 MeV. Exclusive reactions may represent a test of
reaction mechanisms and a promising tool for investigating the dynamics of
nucleon pairs in different states. Cross sections and asymmetries for both
(\gamma,pn) and (\gamma,pp) turn out to be only slightly affected by
short-range correlations and dominated by two-body currents. Therefore,
two-nucleon knockout reactions induced by real photons appear well suited to
investigate the nuclear current and the selectivity of individual transitions
to its different components.

such as in ${}^{208} Pb$, can lead to large $\rho$-$\omega$ mixing at densities
of the order of twice the nuclear saturation density and higher. The typical
mixing angle is of the order of $10^o$. The mixing may result in noticeable
shifts of the positions and widths of resonances. We also analyze temperature
effects and find that temperatures up to 50 MeV have practically no effect on
the mixing.

Hamiltonian to a diagonal form using continuous unitary transformations. To
close the system of flow equations, we present two different schemes. First we
linearize an operator with three pairs of creation and destruction operators by
reducing it to the $z$ component of the quasi spin. We obtain the well known
RPA-result in the limit of large particle number. In the second scheme we
introduce a new operator which improves the resulting spectrum considerably
especially for few particles.

the n qubits are independent. Quantum mechanics violates this inequality by a
ratio that increases exponentially with m. Hence an experiment on n qubits
violating of this inequality sets a lower bound on the number m of entangled
qubits. Next, we propose a definition of maximally entangled states of n
qubits. For this purpose we study 5 different criteria. Four of these criteria
are found compatible. For any number n of qubits, they determine an orthogonal
basis consisting of maximally entangled states generalizing the Bell states.

parameters q and 1/q for these quon algebras are roots of unity with q to the
power k being equal to 1. The case k = 2 corresponds to fermions and the case k
going to infinity to bosons. Generalized coherent states (connected to the
k-fermionic states) and super-coherent states (involving a k-fermionic sector
and a purely bosonic sector) are investigated.
