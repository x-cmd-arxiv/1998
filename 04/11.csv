  4.0, 10 pages, 1 postscript figure",,"10.1086/311422",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the luminosity dependence of the red clump stars on age and
metallicity can cause a difference of up to < ~0.6 mag in the mean absolute I
magnitude of the red clump between different stellar populations. We show that
this effect may resolve the apparent ~0.4 mag discrepancy between red
clump-derived distance moduli to the Magellanic Clouds and those from, e.g.,
Cepheid variables. Taking into account the population effects on red clump
luminosity, we determine a distance modulus to the LMC of 18.36 +/- 0.17 mag,
and to the SMC of 18.82 +/- 0.20 mag. Our alternate red clump LMC distance is
consistent with the value (m-M){LMC} = 18.50 +/- 0.10 adopted by the HST
Cepheid Key Project. We briefly examine model predictions of red clump
luminosity, and find that variations in helium abundance and core mass could
bring the Clouds closer by some 0.10--0.15 mag, but not by the ~0.4 mag that
would result from setting the mean absolute I-magnitude of the Cloud red clumps
equal to the that of the Solar neighborhood red clump.

find that beat pulsations occur naturally when turbulent convection is

  The development of a relaxation code and of a Floquet stability analysis
greatly facilitates the search for and analysis of beat Cepheid models.
  The conditions for the occurrence of beat behavior can be understood easily
and at a fundamental level with the help of amplitude equations. Here a
discriminant D arises whose sign decides whether single mode or double mode
pulsations can occur in a model, and this D depends only on the values of the
nonlinear coupling coefficients between the fundamental and the first overtone

sufficiently strong turbulent convection its sign reverses.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/306053",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a numerical simulation of the dynamical collapse of a nonrotating
magnetic molecular cloud core and follow the core's evolution through the
formation of a central point mass and its subsequent growth to a 1 solar-mass
protostar. The epoch of point-mass formation (PMF) is investigated by a self-
consistent extension of previously presented models of core formation and
contraction in axisymmetric, self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetically
supported interstellar molecular clouds. Prior to PMF, the core is dynamically
contracting and is not well approximated by a quasistatic equilibrium model.
Ambipolar diffusion, which plays a key role in the early evolution of the core,
is unimportant during the dynamical pre-PMF collapse phase. However, the
appearance of a central mass, through its effect on the gravitational field in
the inner core regions, leads to a ""revitalization"" of ambipolar diffusion in
the weakly ionized gas surrounding the central protostar. This process is so
efficient that it leads to a decoupling of the field from the matter and
results in an outward propagating hydromagnetic C-type shock. The existence of
an ambipolar diffusion-mediated shock was predicted by Li & McKee (1996), and
we find that the basic shock structure given by their analytical model is well
reproduced by our more accurate numerical results. Our calculation also
demonstrates that ambipolar diffusion, rather than Ohmic diffusivity operating
in the innermost core region, is the main field decoupling mechanism
responsible for driving the shock after PMF.

demonstrate that, after the protostar first forms, ambipolar diffusion causes
the magnetic flux to decouple in a growing region around the center. The
decoupled field lines remain approximately stationary and drive a hydromagnetic
C-shock that moves outward at a fraction of the speed of sound (typically a few
tenths of a kilometer per second), reaching a distance of a few thousand AU at
the end of the main accretion phase for a solar-mass star. We also show that,

shock if, as is likely to be the case, the inflow speed near the origin is
nonzero at the time of point-mass formation. Although the evolution of

in contrast to the previous theories which made the ad hoc assumption that the
many-body interaction were absent in the reservoirs. We show the following: (i)
The effective potentials of impurities and two-body interaction for the 1D
modes become weaker as $x$ goes away from the conductor. (ii) On the other
hand, the interaction between the 1D and the reservoir modes is important in
the reservoir regions, where the reservoir modes excite and attenuate the 1D
modes through the interaction. (iii) As a result, the current $\hat I_1$ of the
1D modes is not conserved, whereas the total current $\hat I$ is of course
conserved. (iv) For any steady state the total current $\bra I \ket$, its
equilibrium fluctuation $\bra \delta I^2 \ket^{eq}$ at low frequency, and
non-equilibrium fluctuation $\bra \delta I^2 \ket^{noneq}$ at low frequency, of
the original system are independent of $x$, whereas $\bra \delta I^2 \ket^{eq}$
and $\bra \delta I^2 \ket^{noneq}$ at higher frequencies may depend on $x$. (v)
Utilizing this property, we can evaluate $\bra I \ket$, $\bra \delta I^2
\ket^{eq}$, and $\bra \delta I^2 \ket^{noneq}$ at low frequency from those of
the 1D current $\hat I_1$. (vi) In general, the transmittance $T$ in the

shown that both $J$ and $\Delta \mu$ are renormalized by electron-electron

all if the e-e interactions are the only scattering mechanism. It is also shown
that nonequilibrium current fluctuation at low frequency is absent in such a

because it is more or less derived from string theory, but also because it
separates clearly the problem of the initial conditions for the universe from
that of high curvatures. Recently, the pre-big-bang program was subject to
attack from on the grounds that pre-big-bang cosmology does not solve the
horizon and flatness problems in a ``natural'' way, as customary exponential
``new'' inflation does. In particular, it appears that an arbitrarily small
deviation from perfect flatness in the initial state can not be accommodated.
For this analysis, matter in the universe before the big bang was assumed to be
radiation. We perform a similar analysis to theirs, but using the equation of
state for ``string matter'' $\rho=-3p$ which seems more appropriate to the
physical situation and, also, is motivated by the scale factor duality (in the
flat case) with respect to our expanding, radiation dominated, universe. For an
open universe we find, exactly, the same time-dependence of the scale factor as
in the Milne universe, recently found to represent the universal attractor at

  modified, shortened version (one section and one figure removed), conclusion
  enlarged, results unchanged",,"10.1016/S0370-2693(98)00944-7",,"nucl-th",,"  We investigate the modification induced on the nucleon-nucleon cross section
by screening of the interaction inside nuclear matter. The interaction is
described by the relativistic one boson exchange of $\sigma$, $\omega$ and
$\pi$ mesons. Medium effects enter as loop corrections to the meson propagators
and are characterized not only by density, but also by temperature and velocity
with respect to the center of mass of the collision. The cross section displays
peaks for some specific values of the velocity, corresponding to the excitation
of zero-sound modes of the longitudinal $\omega$ field. The enhancement factor
amounts to about 1.5 under reasonable conditions. It increases with density and
is reduced at finite temperature. These findings may have verifiable
consequences on the angular dependence of the measurable secondary particle
distributions.

including the most general one (called the weak condition), an intermediate
one, and the strongest one. The weak condition indicates that we can realize a
FK or QND measuring apparatus of wide classes of observables by allowing the
apparatus to have a finite response range. A recently-proposed QND
photodetector using an electron interferometer is an example of such apparatus.

that the photon frequency is subject to an extra red shift in addition to the
usual self-phase modulation, whereas the photon number is conserved. The Joule
energy consumed in the external circuit is supplied only from the extra red
shift.
