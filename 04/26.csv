image centroid, $\delta x$, as a method to identify the lensed source among
blended stars. Goldberg & Wo\'zniak\markcite{goldberg1997} actually applied
this method to the OGLE-1 database and found that 7 out of 15 events showed
significant centroid shifts of $\delta x \gtrsim 0.2$ arcsec. The amount of
centroid shift has been estimated theoretically by
Goldberg.\markcite{goldberg1997} However, he treated the problem in general and
did not apply it to a particular survey or field, and thus based his estimates
on simple toy model luminosity functions (i.e., power laws). In this paper, we
construct the expected distribution of $\delta x$ for Galactic bulge events by
using the precise stellar LF observed by Holtzman et al.\markcite{holtzman1998}
using HST. Their LF is complete up to $M_I\sim 9.0$ ($M_V\sim 12$),
corresponding to faint M-type stars. In our analysis we find that regular
blending cannot produce a large fraction of events with measurable centroid
shifts. By contrast, a significant fraction of events would have measurable
centroid shifts if they are affected by amplification-bias blending. Therefore,
Goldberg & Wo\'zniak's measurements of large centroid shifts for a large
fraction of microlensing events confirms the prediction of Han and Alard that a
large fraction of Galactic bulge events are affected by amplification-bias
blending.

single candidate binary source event has been reported. To account for the
rarity of binary source events, Dominik pointed out that for a typical binary
source event the separation between the component source stars is very large,
resulting in large difference in impact parameters between the component binary
source stars. In these cases, the light curve of the highly amplified source
star is barely affected by the light from the other star, making the observed
binary source light curve difficult to distinguish from that of a single source
lensing event. In this paper, we determine the fraction of events with similar
source star amplifications is as much as $\sim 8%$, and thus show that the very
low detection rate for binary source events cannot be explained by this effect
alone. By carrying out realistic simulations of binary source events, we find
that a significant fraction of binary source events are additionally missed
from detection due to various other reasons. First, if the flux ratio between
the component stars is very large, the light curve of the bright star is hardly
affected by the light from the faint star. Second, if the separation is too
small, the binary source stars behave like a single star, making it difficult
to separate the binary source event from a single event. Finally, although the
probability of detecting binary source events increases as the source
separation increases, still some fraction of binary source events will be
missed because the light curves of these events will mimic those of single
source events with longer timescales and larger values of the impact parameter.

  d-wave to s-wave type superconductor junctions","4 pages",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Recent measurements on a class of high-Tc superconductors (HTSC) have shown
that Cooper-pairs binding may be associated to a d-wave, while in another
class, d and s waves may coexist. When d-wave Cooper-pairs are injected in a
superconductor that can sustain s-wave binding, d-wave pairs decay to s-wave
pairs and energy is irradiated by means of gravitons. We show that in s-wave to
d-wave type superconductor (SDS) junctions in an equilibrium condition no net
gravitational wave energy is emitted, on the other hand under non equilibrium
conditions a net gravitational wave energy is emitted by the junction.
Experiments which show a gravitational interaction between inomogeneus high-Tc
superconductors, under non equilibrium conditions, and test objects may be
understood by accepting a possibility of emission of gravitational radiation
from SDS junctions.

in perturbation theory. It is shown by explicit calculations to the second loop
order (when the non-abelian nature of the QCD interactions first become
apparent) that all infrared sensitive terms to logarithmic and linear accuracy
cancel when the decay width is expressed in terms of the short distance mass.
This in turn implies the absense of any non perturbative $1/m_Q$ power
corrections to the decay width. The cancellation is shown algebraically at the
level of the Feynman integrands without any use of an explicit infrared cutoff.
This result is in accord with the implications of the KLN theorem.

we review the classical discrete time equations in the Coulomb and Lorentz

our mechanics and how temporal discretisation should influence very early
universe dynamics. Quantisation of the Maxwell potentials is approached via the
discrete time Schwinger action principle and the Faddeev-Popov path integral.
We demonstrate complete agreement in the case of the Coulomb gauge, obtaining
the vacuum functional and the discrete time field commutators in that gauge.
Finally, we use the Faddeev-Popov method to construct the discrete time
analogues of the photon propagator in the Landau and Feynman gauges, which
casts light on the break with relativity and possible discrete time analogues
of the metric tensor.

quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. Its evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\""odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  In the second part of this investigation we derive several forms of the
bundle (analogue of the) Schr\""odinger equation governing the time evolution of
state sections. We prove that up to a constant the matrix-bundle Hamiltonian,
entering in the bundle analogue of the matrix form of the conventional
Schr\""odinger equation, coincides with the matrix of coefficients of the
evolution transport. This allows to interpret the Hamiltonian as a gauge field.
Here we also apply the bundle approach to the description of observables. It is
shown that to any observable there corresponds a unique Hermitian bundle
morphism (along paths) and vice versa.
