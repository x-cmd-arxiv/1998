not differ either from other sources in each sample, nor from all the gamma-ray

luminosities and of the broad band spectral indices (radio to optical and radio
to X-ray). We compute average Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from radio
to gamma rays for groups of blazars binned according to radio luminosity,
irrespective of the original classification as BL Lac or FSRQ. The resulting
SEDs show a remarkable continuity in that: i) the first peak occurs in
different frequency ranges for different luminosity classes, with most luminous
sources peaking at lower frequencies; ii) the peak frequency of the gamma-ray
component correlates with the peak frequency of the lower energy one; iii) the
luminosity ratio between the high and low frequency components increases with
bolometric luminosity. The continuity of properties among different classes of
blazars and the systematic trends of the SEDs as a function of luminosity favor
a unified view of the blazar phenomenon: a single parameter, related to
luminosity, seems to govern the physical properties and radiation mechanisms in
the relativistic jets present in BL Lac objects as well as in FSRQ. The general
implications of this unified scheme are discussed.

strong, negative correlation between the image separation and source redshift
for gravitational lenses. This is somewhat puzzling if one believes in a flat

to be independent of the source redshift, while one expects a negative
correlation in a k = -1 universe and a positive one in a k = +1 universe. Park
& Gott explored several effects which could cause the observed correlation, but
no combination of these can explain the observations with a realistic scenario.
Here, I explore this test further in three ways. First, I show that in an
inhomogeneous universe a negative correlation is expected regardless of the
value of k. Second, I test whether the image separation-source redshift
relation can be used as a test to determine lambda and Omega, rather than just
the sign of k. Third, I compare the results of the test from the Park & Gott
sample to those using other samples of gravitational lenses, which can
illuminate (unknown) selection effects and probe the usefulness of the image
separation-source redshift relation as a cosmological test.

EELR morphology vary from linear to conical to S-shaped and even X-shaped.
Almost exclusively all elongated EELR are in Seyfert 2 galaxies. The
orientation of the EELR appears to be random relative to either the major (or
minor) axis or relative to the non-axisymmetric structures, such as bars or
ovals, when present, and there is a hint of relation to the morphological type.

the bias of quasars on scale larger than the size of these halos is mainly

SCDM and LCDM, can be fairly well reconciled with the data of quasars,

Keldysh techniques with the NCA approximation to solve the time-dependent
Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian in the infinite-U limit, Shao, Nordlander and
Langreth found an anomalously strong surface-temperature dependence of the
outgoing charge state fractions. Here we employ the dynamical 1/N expansion
with finite Coulomb interaction U to provide a more realistic description of
the scattering process. We test the accuracy of the 1/N expansion in the
spinless N = 1 case against the exact independent-particle solution. We then
compare results obtained in the infinite-U limit with the NCA approximation and
recover qualitative features found previously. Finally, we analyze the
realistic situation of Ca atoms with U = 5.8 eV scattered off Cu(001) surfaces.
Although the presence of the doubly-ionized Ca species can change the absolute
scattered positive Ca yields, the temperature dependence is qualitatively the
same as that found in the infinite-U limit. One of the main difficulties that
experimentalists face in attempting to detect this effect is that the atomic
velocity must be kept small enough to reduce possible kinematic smearing of the

case that $m_1 \sim m_2 \ll m_3$ ($m_i$ are neutrino masses), we obtain, from
the data of the CHOOZ and Super KAMIOKANDE, $0.28 \le \sin^2\theta_{23} \le

has been spurred mainly by the large top mass and, hence, the strong hierarchy
in quark masses. Recently, various symmetry breaking schemes have been proposed
based on the discrete, non-Abelian group S3L x S3R, which is broken according
to S3L x S3R > S3_diag > S2_diag. The group S3 treats three objects
symmetrically, while the hierarchical nature of the Yukawa matrices is a
consequence of the representation structure, 1 + 2, of S3, which treats the
generations differently. Different ansaetze for the breaking of the sub-nuclear
democracy give different Hermitian mass matrices, M, of the same modified
Fritzsch type which differ in the numerical value of the ratio M_23/M_22. A fit
to the experimentally determined absolute values of the elements of the CKM
matrix gives bounds on the possible values of the CP violating phase and gives
a clear indication on the preferred symmetry breaking scheme. A parametrization
of the CKM mixing matrix in terms of four quark mass ratios and one CP
violating phase in very good agreement with the absolute value of the
experimentally determined values of the CKM matrix elements is obtained.

its integrability. Finally, we obtain the reductions of the Gambier mapping,
identify their integrable forms and compute their continuous limits.

through linearization. The different origins of mappings of this type are
examined: projective equations and Gambier systems. The integrable cases are
obtained through the application of the singularity confinement criterion and
are explicitly integrated.
