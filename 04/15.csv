head-on or off-center collision of two neutron stars, employing a basically
Newtonian PPM code but including the emission of gravitational waves and their
back-reaction on the hydrodynamical flow. A physical nuclear equation of state
is used that allows us to follow the thermodynamical evolution of the stellar
matter and to compute the emission of neutrinos. Predicted gravitational wave
signals, luminosities and waveforms, are presented. The models are evaluated
for their implications for gamma-ray burst scenarios. We find an extremely
luminous outburst of neutrinos with a peak luminosity of more than 4E54 erg/s
for several milliseconds. This leads to an efficiency of about 1% for the
annihilation of neutrinos with antineutrinos, corresponding to an average
energy deposition rate of more than 1E52 erg/s and a total energy of about 1E50
erg deposited in electron-positron pairs around the collision site within 10ms.
Although these numbers seem very favorable for gamma-ray burst scenarios, the
pollution of the $e^\pm$ pair-plasma cloud with nearly 0.1$M_{\odot}$ of
dynamically ejected baryons is 5 orders of magnitude too large. Therefore the
formation of a relativistically expanding fireball that leads to a gamma-ray
burst powered by neutrino emission from colliding neutron stars is definitely
ruled out.

7469 in the X-ray with RXTE over a ~30d baseline. The source shows strong
variability with a root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of ~16 per cent, and
peak-to-peak variations of a factor of order 2. Simultaneous data over this
period were obtained in the ultraviolet (UV) using IUE, making this the most
intensive X-ray UV/X-ray variability campaign performed for any active galaxy.
Comparison of the continuum light curves reveals very similar amplitudes of
variability, but different variability characteristics, with the X-rays showing
much more rapid variations. The data are not strongly correlated at zero lag.
The largest absolute value of the correlation coefficient occurs for an
anticorrelation between the two bands, with the X-ray variations leading the UV
by ~4d. The largest positive correlation is for the ultraviolet to lead the
X-rays by ~4d. Neither option appears to be compatible with any simple
interband transfer function. The peak positive correlation at ~4d occurs
because the more prominent peaks in the UV light curve appear to lead those in
the X-rays by this amount. However, the minima of the light curves are
near-simultaneous. These observations provide new constraints on theoretical
models of the central regions of active galactic nuclei. Models in which the
observed UV emission is produced solely by re-radiation of absorber X-rays are
ruled out by our data, as are those in which the X-rays are produced solely by
Compton upscattering of the observed UV component by a constant distribution of
particles.

obtained ground-based and HST images of all multiple-image lens systems in our

for the dark lens hypothesis. If it is to survive, ad hoc modifications seem to
be necessary: only very massive galaxies (more than about one trillion solar
masses) can be dark, and the cutoff in mass must be sharp. Our finding of lens
galaxies in all the JVAS/CLASS systems is complementary evidence which supports
the conclusion of Kochanek et al. (1997) that many of the wide-separation

survey of a contiguous 4 deg x 4 deg region. The advantage of using large
contiguous surveys for measuring clustering properties on even modest angular
scales is substantial: the effects of cosmic scatter are strongly suppressed.
We provide highly accurate measurements of the two-point angular correlation
function, w(theta), as a function of magnitude on scales up to 1.5 degrees. The
amplitude of w(theta) declines by a factor of ~10 over the range 16 <= I <= 20
but only by a factor of 2 - 3 over the range 20 < I <= 23. For a redshift
dependence of the spatial correlation function, xi(r), parameterized as
xi(r,z)=(r/r_o)^(-gamma)(1 + z)^(-[3+epsilon]), we find r_o=5.2 +/- 0.4 Mpc/h,
and epsilon >= 0 for I <= 20. This is in good agreement with the results from
local redshift surveys. At I > 20, our best fit values shift towards lower r_o
and more negative epsilon. A strong covariance between r_o and epsilon prevent
us from rejecting epsilon > 0 even at faint magnitudes but if epsilon > 1, we
strongly reject r_o <= 4/h Mpc (co-moving). The above expression for xi(r,z)
and our data give a correlation length of r_o(z=0.5) approx 3.0 +/- 0.4 Mpc/h,
about a factor of 2 larger than the correlation length at z = 0.5 derived from
the Canada--France Redshift Survey (CFRS). The small volume sampled by the CFRS
and other deep redshift probes, however, make these spatial surveys strongly
susceptible to cosmic scatter and will tend to bias their derived correlation
lengths low. Our galaxy counts agree well with those from the HDF survey and,
thus, argue against a significant inclusion of sub-galactic components in the
latter census for I < 24.

remnant comprises a giant molecular cloud whose edge is closely parallel to a
ridge of bright non-thermal radio continuum, which evidently delineates the
blast-wave into the cloud. We found that in a small (0.6 pc) portion of the
radio shell, the molecular line profiles consist of a narrow (2 km/s)
component, plus a very wide (> 20 km/s) component. Both spectral components
peak within 20"" of a previously-detected OH 1720 MHz maser. We name this source
3C 391:BML (broad molecular line); it provides a new laboratory, similar to IC
443 but on a larger scale, to study shock interactions with dense molecular
gas. The wide spectral component is relatively brighter in the
higher-excitation lines. We interpret the wide spectral component as post-shock
gas, either smoothly accelerated or partially dissociated and reformed behind
the shock. The narrow component is either the pre-shock gas or cold gas
reformed behind a fully dissociative shock. Using the 3 observed CS lines, we
measured the temperature, CS column density, and H2 volume density in a dense
clump in the parent molecular cloud as well as the wide-line and narrow-line
portions of the shocked clump. The physical conditions of the narrow-line gas
are comparable to the highest-density clumps in the giant molecular cloud,
while the wide-line gas is both warmer and denser. The mass of compressed gas
in 3C 391:BML is high enough that its self-gravity is significant, and

the memory disorder Alzheimer's. Protein aggregation have traditionally been
connected to either unfolded or native states. Inclusion body formation
(disordered aggregation) has been assumed to arise from hydrophobic aggregation
of the unfolded or denaturated states, while the amyloid fibrils (ordered
aggregation) have been assumed to arise from native-like conformations in a
process analogous to the polymerization of hemoglobin S. Making use of
lattice-model simulations we find that both ordered and disordered aggregation
arise from elementary structures which eventually build the folding nucleus of
the heteropolymers, and takes place when some of the most strongly interacting
amino acids establish their contacts leading to the formation of a specific
subset of the native structure. These elementary structures can be viewed as
the partially folded intermediates suggested to be involved in the aggregation

is the asymmetric simple exclusion process, for which the measures in question
describe the microscopic structure of shocks. In this case we compute
explicitly the translation sums and find that shocks generated in different

boundary conditions in a finite system---are described by shift equivalent

interacting stop triplet. We determine the phase diagram, the critical

find that a two-stage transition exists non-perturbatively, as well, but for

or more generally, lambda = mu^+ for mu strong limit singular of ``small''
cofinality. A second one is mu = mu^{< kappa}< lambda < 2^mu ; the main case is
lambda regular but we also have things to say on the singular case. Lastly, we
deal with ultraproducts of Boolean algebras in relation to irr(-) and s(-) etc.

recent experimental study of the evolution of a mesoscopic superposition state
prepared in a definite mode of a high-Q cavity can be used to determine the
eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of the field, provided the assumed
dynamical conditions are actually fulfilled to experimental accuracy. These
conditions involve i) a purely dispersive coupling of the field to the Rydberg
atoms used to manipulate and to monitor the cavity field, and ii) the effective
absence of correlations in the ground state of the system consisting of the
cavity coupled to the ``reservoir'' which accounts for the decoherence and
damping processes. A microscopic calculation at zero temperature is performed
and compared to master equation results.

simple quantum circuit related to it that we believe cannot be parallelized to
less than linear depth, and therefore might be used to prove that QNC < QP.
