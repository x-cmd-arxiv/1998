assuming that the magnetic field is initially confined to the crust. The
evolution of the crustal field is determined by the conductive properties of
the crust which, in its turn, depend on the thermal history of the neutron
star. Due to this fact, a study of the magnetic field decay may be a powerful
diagnostic of the properties of matter in the core where the density is above
the nuclear density. We treat the evolution of neutron stars for different
possible equations of state and cooling scenarios (standard and, so called,
accelerated cooling).
  The spin evolution is strongly influenced by the behaviour of the magnetic
field. Assuming that the spin-down rate of the neutron star is determined by
the magnetodipole radiation, we calculated the evolutionary tracks of isolated
pulsars in the $B - \tau$ and $B-P$ planes, where $B$ and $P$ are the magnetic
field and period, respectively, and $\tau$ is the spin-down age. The calculated
tracks are compared with observational data on the magnetic field and period of
pulsars. This comparison allows to infer the most suitable equations of state
of nuclear matter and cooling model and to determine the range of parameters of
the original magnetic configurations of pulsars.

corrections to the dynamic structure factors due to both density and spin

large factors around and above nuclear density. In addition, we find that the
spectrum of energy transfers in neutrino scattering is considerably broadened
by the interactions in the medium. An identifiable component of this broadening
comes from the absorption and emission of quanta of collective modes akin to
the Gamow-Teller and Giant Dipole resonances in nuclei (zero-sound; spin
waves), with \v{C}erenkov kinematics. Under the assumption that both the
charged-current and the neutral-current cross sections are decreased by
many-body effects, we calculate a set of ad hoc protoneutron star cooling

considered two cases; a massive C-O white dwarf of ~1M_sun accreting C-O
mixture, and a low mass white dwarf with an initial mass of 0.4M_sun accreting
matter composed mostly of helium.
  The accretion rate of the C-O white dwarf is assumed to be 1x10^{-5}M_sun/y.
After carbon burning is ignited at $M_r\sim1.04M_\odot$, the flame propagates
inward due to heat conduction. By inserting enough grid points to resolve the
structure of the flame, we have obtained almost steady burning in most phase of
evolution, but we have found a new phenomenon that the strength of flame
sometimes oscillates due to a thermal instability in early phase of the
evolution. The flame propagates to reach the center and the C-O mixture has
been burned into an O-Ne-Mg mixture without causing an explosive phenomenon.
  For helium accreting low mass white dwarfs, we have considered accretion
rates of 1x10^{-7} and 1x10^{-6}M_sun/y. After a fraction of M_sun is accreted
to the white dwarf, helium is ignited in the outer part and a shell flash
occurs. Such a shell flash diminishes when about 10% of helium in the
convective shell is burned into carbon and oxygen. The next shell flash occurs
at a shell interior to the previously flashed shell. After less than 30 shell
flashes, the helium ignition occurs at the center and steady burning begins.
Thus, the merging produces a helium star which burns helium at the center.

strong interactions between the radio jets and the interstellar medium. Such

radio jets sweep up and compress ambient gas, producing ordered structures with
enhanced surface brightness in line emission. In at least three galaxies,
namely Mrk 573, ESO 428-G14, and Mrk 34, and perhaps also NGC 7212, off-nuclear
radio lobes coincide with regions of low gaseous excitation (as measured by the

are associated with high gas densities, reducing the ionization parameter.

statistical effect, has become topical again now that the results of the
Hipparcos satellite have become available. This statistical effect, the
so-called Lutz-Kelker bias, causes measured parallaxes to be too large. This
has the implication that inferred distances, and hence inferred luminosities
are too small. Published analytic calculations of the Lutz-Kelker bias indicate
that the inferred luminosity of an object is, on average, 30% too small when
the error in the parallax is only 17.5%. Yet, this bias has never been
determined empirically. In this paper we investigate whether there is such a
bias by comparing the best Hipparcos parallaxes which ground-based
measurements. We find that there is indeed a large bias affecting parallaxes,
with an average and scatter comparable to predictions. We propose a simple
method to correct for the LK bias, and apply it successfully to a sub-sample of
our stars. We then analyze the sample of 26 `best' Cepheids used by Feast &
Catchpole (1997) to derive the zero-point of the fundamental mode pulsators and

see indications that the remaining angular momentum deficit (a factor of 5 in
the blow-out models) is due to current limitations in the numerical method

exchange on the resummed cross section is contained in the eigenvalues and

factorization of coherent soft gluons from the hard scattering. The precise
formulas depend on the partonic scattering angles and energies, as well as on
the method used to define the jets in the final state. For cone dijets at fixed

solution different from the known static hyperboloid and black hole. We also
showed that static Nielsen-Olesen vortices saturate Bogomolnyi-type bound only
when the cosmological constant vanishes.

magnetic fields are calculated by means of our 2D mesh Hartree-Fock method for
field strengths ranging from zero up to 2.35 10^8 T. With increasing field
strength the ground state undergoes two transitions involving three different
electronic configurations: for weak fields the ground state configuration
arises from the field-free 1s^22s configuration, for intermediate fields from
the 1s^22p_{-1} configuration and in high fields the 1s2p_{-1}3d_{-2}
electronic configuration is responsible for the properties of the atom. The
transition field strengths are determined. Calculations on the ground state of
the Li+ ion allow us to describe the field-dependent ionization energy of the
Li atom. Some general arguments on the ground states of multi-electron atoms in
strong magnetic fields are provided.

equation. Since the KDP--equation which describes spin-0 and spin-1 bosons is
of Dirac-type, we examine some analogies and differences from the Dirac
equation. The main difference to the Dirac equation is that the KDP equation
contains redundant components. We will show that as a result certain
interaction terms in the Hamilton form of the KDP equation do not have a
physical meaning and will not affect the calculation of physical observables.
We point out that a second order KDP equation derived by Kemmer as an analogy
to the second order Dirac equation is of limited physical applicability as (i)
it belongs to a class of second order equations which can be derived from the
original KDP equation and (ii) it lacks a back-transformation which would allow
one to obtain solutions of the KDP equation out of solutions of the second
order equation. We therefore suggest a different higher order equation which,
as far as the solutions for the wave functions are concerned, is equivalent to
the orginal first order KDP wave equation.
