system parameters along evolutionary sequences of black hole X-ray binaries
(BHXBs) that are consistent with transient behaviour. In particular, we focus
on the hitherto neglected group of BHXBs with intermediate-mass giant donor
stars. These spend a significant fraction of their X-ray active phase crossing
the Hertzsprung gap.
  Three Case B binary sequences with a black hole accretor and 2.5 M_sun
initial donor mass are presented in detail. We formulate rules which summarize
the behaviour of these sequences and provide an approximate description for
Case B mass transfer in intermediate-mass BHXBs. Chiefly, the timescale of the
overall radius expansion is given by the initial donor mass, while the surface
appearance is determined by the current donor mass.
  With these rules we obtain a general overview of transient and persistent
behaviour of all intermediate-mass BHXBs by just considering single star
sequences of different mass. We find that although systems in the process of
crossing the Hertzsprung gap are in general persistently bright, with
Eddington- or super-Eddington transfer rates, there is a narrow instability
strip where transient behaviour is possible. This strip extends over a
secondary mass range 2.0-3.5 M_sun. GRO J1655-40 might be such a system. We
predict that there are no BHXB transients with donors more massive than 3.5
M_sun, and no neutron star transients in the Hertzsprung gap.

planet and the disk; by outward torques between the planet and the spinning

loss from the planet. We present self-consistent numerical considerations of
the problem of migrating giant planets. Summing torques on planets for various
physical parameters, we find that Jupiter-mass planets can stably arrive and
survive at small heliocentric distances, thus reproducing observed properties
of some of the recently discovered extra-solar planets. Inward migration
timescales can be approximately equal to or less than disk lifetimes and star
spindown timescales. Therefore, the range of fates of massive planets is broad,
and generally comprises three classes: (I) planets which migrate inward too
rapidly and lose all their mass; (II) planets which migrate inward, lose some
but not all of their mass, and survive in very small orbits; and (III) planets
which do not lose any mass. Some planets in Class III do not migrate very far
from their formation locations. Our results show that there is a wide range of
possible fates for Jupiter-mass planets for both final heliocentric distance

much recent attention, particularly as a possible explanation of 15--60 Hz
quasi-periodic brightness oscillations (QPOs) from accreting neutron stars in
low-mass X-ray binaries, and of somewhat higher-frequency QPOs from accreting
stellar-mass black holes. Previous analyses of this phenomenon have either
ignored radiation forces or assumed for simplicity that the radiation field is
isotropic, and in particular that there is no variation of the radiation field
with angular distance from the rotational equatorial plane of the compact
object. However, in most realistic accretion geometries (e.g., those in which
the accretion proceeds via a geometrically thin disk) the radiation field
depends on latitude. Here we show that in this case radiation forces typically
have an important, even dominant, effect on the precession frequency of test
particles in orbits that are tilted with respect to the star's rotational
equator. Indeed, we find that even for accretion luminosities only a few
percent of the Eddington critical luminosity, the precession frequency near a
neutron star can be changed by factors of up to $\sim 10$. Radiation forces
must therefore be included in analyses of precession frequencies near compact
objects, in such varied contexts as low-frequency QPOs, warp modes of disks,
and trapped oscillation modes. We discuss specifically the impact of radiation
forces on models of low-frequency QPOs involving gravitomagnetic precession,
and show that such models are rendered much less plausible by the effects of
radiation forces.

the enhancement factors. We concentrate on carbon and oxygen ions and show that
at very high-densities, high-order quantum effects will be important and act to
reduce the zeroth order, classical value for the enhancement factor. We show
that in any case, the total electron contribution remains weak, namely an
enhancement in the reaction of about a factor 2, contrarily to what had been

is considered by incorporating both the effect of neutron star cooling and the
effect of space-time curvature produced by the intense gravitational field of
the star. For this purpose a stationary and static gravitational field has been
considered with the standard as well as the accelerated cooling models of
neutron stars. It is shown that general relativistic effect reduces the
magnetic field decay rate substantially. At the late stage of evolution when
the field decay is mainly determined by the impurity-electron scattering, the
effect of space-time curvature suppresses the role of the impurity content
significantly and reduces the decay rate by more than an order of magnitude.
Even with a high impurity content the decay rate is too low to be of
observational interest if the accelerated cooling model along with the effect
of space-time curvature is taken into account. It is, therefore, pointed out
that if a decrease in the magnetic field strength by more than two orders of
magnitude from its initial value is detected by observation then the existence
of quark in the core of the neutron star would possibly be ruled out.

  The huge overdensities we measure for these three classes of object are much
larger than the mass overdensities of typical clusters at this redshift, as
predicted by CDM and related models. We suggest therefore that the distribution
of damped Ly-alpha absorption line systems, of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies and
of extremely red objects are all very strongly biassed, and that somehow a
small overdensity of mass has increased the fraction of baryons in collapsed

  We speculate that some unknown physical process, acting on the volume
occupied by our cluster, caused the normally diffuse ionised inter-galactic

which produce the Ly-alpha absorption-lines. Star formation occurred within
these blobs at z>5, enriching them with metals and producing stars, which after
several mergers and ~ 0.5 Gyr of passive evolution form the extremely red

results confirm our first conclusions on the nature of the intermediate
redshift Ly-alpha forest absorbers. A small fraction of them is tightly linked
to galaxies, and most probably arise in the external parts of giant halos
(R~200 kpc with H0=50 km/s/Mpc) around fairly luminous galaxies (M_AB(B) < -19)
of various spectral and morphological types, as shown by HST imaging of these
objects. Most of the absorbing clouds appear to be only ``associated'' with
galaxies, in the sense that they could trace the gaseous filaments or sheets of
large-scale structures. Thus, as expected from a sample tracing large scale
structures, these galaxies have various spectral types. We also find that
groups of galaxies have always at least one associated Ly-alpha absorption
line.

milder short-term variations superposed. The amplitude of the continuum

about 20 days, with uncertainties of about 8 days. There is some evidence that
HeII responds somewhat more rapidly, with a time delay of around 10 days, but
again, the uncertainties are quite large (~8 days). The mean and rms spectra of

plane, will increase in flux density when it decelerates. This effect is the
basis for the qualitative model for GPS galaxies we present in this paper,
which can explain their low-variability convex spectrum, their compact double
or compact symmetric morphology, and the lack of GPS quasars at similar
redshifts. Components are expelled from the nucleus at relativistic speeds at a
large angle to the line of sight, and are decelerated (eg. by ram-pressure or
entrainment of the external gas) before contributing to a mini-lobe. The young
components are Doppler boosted in the direction of motion but appear fainter
for the observer. The non-relativistic mini-lobes dominate the structure and
are responsible for the low variability in flux density and the convex radio
spectrum as well as the compact double angular morphology. Had the same source
been orientated at a small angle to the line of sight, the young components
would be boosted in the observer's direction resulting in a flat and variable
radio spectrum at high frequencies. Hence the characteristic convex spectrum of
a GPS source would not be seen. These sources at small angles to the line of
sight are probably identified with quasars, and are not recognized as GPS
sources, but are embedded in the large population of flat spectrum variable
quasars and BL Lac objects. This leads to a deficiency in GPS/CSOs identified
with quasars.

the coset method and the graded eigenvalue method, we derive the two-level

eigenvalue approach leads to an expression for $X_2(r)$ which is valid for all
values of the parameter $\lambda$ governing the strength of the GUE admixture
on the unfolded scale. A new twofold integration representation is found which
can be easily evaluated numerically. For $\lambda \gg 1$ the Breit-Wigner width
$\Gamma_1$ measured in units of the mean level spacing $D$ is much larger than
unity. In this limit, closed analytical expression for $X_2(r)$ and
$\Sigma^2(r)$ can be derived by (i) evaluating the double integral
perturbatively or (ii) an ab initio perturbative calculation employing the
coset method. The instructive comparison between both approaches reveals that
random fluctuations of $\Gamma_1$ manifest themselves in modifications of the
spectral statistics. The energy scale which determines the deviation of the
statistical properties from GUE behavior is given by $\sqrt{\Gamma_1}$. This is
rigorously shown and discussed in great detail. The Breit-Wigner $\Gamma_1$
width itself governs the approach to the Poisson limit for $r\to\infty$. Our
analytical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations of an ensemble of
$500\times 500$ matrices, which demonstrate the universal validity of our

four-dimensional space-time theory and follows as singular limit from
Einstein's theory, if the velocity of light tends to the infinity. Here
'singular' stands for the fact, that the limiting geometrical structure differs
from a regular Riemannian space-time. Geometrically, the transition Einstein to
Newton can be viewed as an 'opening' of the light cones. This picture suggests
that there might be other singular limits of Einstein's theory: Let all light
cones shrink and ultimately become part of a congruence of singular world
lines. The limiting structure may be considered as a nullhypersurface embedded
in a five-dimensional spacetime. While the velocity of light tends to zero
here, all other velocities tend to the velocity of light. Thus one may speak of
an ultrarelativistic limit of General Relativity. The resulting theory is as
simple as Newton's gravitational theory, with the basic difference, that
Newton's elliptic differential equation is replaced by essentially ordinary
differential equations, with derivatives tangent to the generators of the
singular congruence. The Galilei group is replaced by the Carroll group
introduced by L\'evy-Leblond. We suggest to study near ultrarelativistic
situations with a perturbational approach starting from the singular structure,

conformal coupling of a free, scalar field. One finds that, for a minimally
coupled field with mass $0 \leq m^2 < 9 H_0^2/4$ (except for $m^2= 2H_0^2$),
the one-mode occupation number grows to unity soon after the physical
wavelength of the mode becomes larger than the Hubble radius, and afterwards
diverges as $n(t) \sim O(1)(\lambda_{phys}(t)/H_0^{-1})^{2\nu}$, where $\nu
\equiv [9/4 - m^2/H_0^2]^{1/2}$. However, for a field with $m^2 > 9H_0^2/4$,
the occupation number of a mode outside the Hubble radius is rapidly
oscillating and bounded and does not exceed unity. These results, readily
generalized for cases of a nonminimal coupling, provide a clear argument that
the long-wavelength vacuum fluctuations of low-mass fields in an inflationary
universe do show classical behavior, while those of heavy fields do not. The
interaction or self-interaction does not appear necessary for the emergence of
classical features, which are entirely due to the rapid expansion of the de
Sitter background and the upside-down nature of quantum oscillators for modes
outside the Hubble radius.

some definitions for the source multipole moments, valid to all orders in a
post-Newtonian expansion, and depending in a well-defined way on the total
stress-energy pseudo-tensor of the material and gravitational fields.
Previously obtained expressions of the source multipole moments are recovered
in the appropriate limits. The source moments parametrize the linearized
approximation of the gravitational field exterior to the source, as computed by
means of a specific post-Minkowskian algorithm defined in a previous work.
Since the radiative multipole moments parametrizing the radiation field far
from the source can be obtained as non-linear functionals of the source
moments, the present paper permits relating the radiation field far from a
slowly-moving source to the stress-energy pseudo-tensor of the source. This
should be useful when comparing to theory the future observations of
gravitational radiation by the LIGO and VIRGO experiments.

are reviewed. It is shown that both types of symmetry breaking can be traced to
effects of modes near zero virtuality. Above T_c, where chiral symmetry is
restored, it is shown on general grounds that (in the massless quark limit),
the density of states vanishes at zero virtuality faster than $\lambda$, where
$\lambda$ is the virtuality-- $\rho(\lambda) \sim |\lambda|^\alpha$ is not
possible for $\alpha \le 1$. Isospin invariance is used to show that
$\rho(\lambda) \sim m_q^{1-\alpha} |\lambda|^\alpha$ is also not possible for
$\alpha \le 1$. State-of-the-art lattice calculations are reviewed in light of
these constraints. In particular, it is argued that violations of these
constraints by lattice calculations indicate possible large systematic errors;
this raises questions about $U(1)_A$ violating effects seen on the lattice.It
is also shown that above $T_c$, the Dirac spectrum has a gap near zero (in the

for the $N N \to N Y K$ and $\Delta N \to N Y K$ ($Y = \Lambda$ or $\Sigma$)

energies about 3.5 GeV. The microscopic cross sections are parametrized in all

"physics/9801031","Dmitriy Palatnik","Dmitriy Palatnik","On quantization of mass and electrical charge","withdrawn due to unlikely result",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Suggested non-linear, non-gauge modification of the Maxwell theory of
electromagnetism based on correlation between electromagnetic potential, $A_a$,
and metric, $g_{ab}$, such that tensor $G_{ab} = g_{ab} - l^2{A}_a{A}_b$
represents observable metric. Here $l$ is fundamental constant of the theory.
The idea, that the charge density of elementary particle could be a function of
electromagnetic potential and background metric (only) is accepted, and
specific model of the density is considered. Due to non-linearity of equations,
one obtains solutions corresponding to quantized electrical charge with
spectrum $q_{n} = {{2n}\over3}e$ and $q'_{n} = -{(2n+1)\over3}e$, where $n = 0,
1, 2, ...$

noise, transmitted bit-error-rate (BER) and mutual information, showing how the
noise description is meaningful only for Gaussian channels. After reviewing the
description of a quantum communication channel, we study the insertion of an
amplifier. We focus attention on the case of direct detection, where the linear
amplifier has a 3 decibels noise figure, which is usually considered an
unsurpassable limit, referred to as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Both
noise and BER could be reduced using an ideal amplifier, which is feasible in
principle. However, just a reduction of noise beyond the SQL does not generally
correspond to an improvement of the BER or of the mutual information. This is
the case of a laser amplifier, where saturation can greatly reduce the noise
figure, although there is no corresponding improvement of the BER. Such
mechanism is illustrated on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations.

with arbitrary initial amplitude distributions. First order linear difference
equations are found for the time evolution of the amplitudes of the r marked

the optimal measurement time T \sim O(\sqrt{N/r}) is derived which is shown to
depend only on the initial average amplitudes of the marked and unmarked
states. A bound on the probability of measuring a marked state is derived,
which depends only on the standard deviation of the initial amplitude
distributions of the marked or unmarked states.

optical phase-shift. In the first step an unsharp, however, unbiased joint
measurement of the phase and photon number is performed by heterodyning the
signal field. Information coming from this step is then used for suitable
squeezing of the probe mode to obtain a sharp phase distribution. Application
to squeezed states leads to a phase sensitivity scaling as $\Delta\phi\simeq
N^{-1}$ relative to the total number of photons impinged into the apparatus.
Numerical simulations of the whole detection strategy are also also presented.
