suggest that the two groups of objects share many common properties. A
comparison of the spectral indices between samples of normal and millisecond
pulsars demonstrates that millisecond pulsar spectra are not significantly
different from those of normal pulsars. There is evidence, however, that
millisecond pulsars are slightly less luminous and less efficient radio
emitters compared to normal pulsars. We confirm recent suggestions that a
diversity exists among the luminosities of millisecond pulsars with the
isolated millisecond pulsars being less luminous than the binary millisecond
pulsars. There are indications that old millisecond pulsars exhibit somewhat
flatter spectra than the presumably younger ones. We present evidence that
millisecond pulsar profiles are only marginally more complex than those found
among the normal pulsar population. Moreover, the development of the profiles
with frequency is rather slow, suggesting very compact magnetospheres. The
profile development seems to anti-correlate with the companion mass and the
spin period, again suggesting that the amount of mass transfer in a binary
system might directly influence the emission properties. The angular radius of
radio beams of millisecond pulsars does not follow the scaling predicted from a
canonical pulsar model which is applicable for normal pulsars. Instead they are
systematically smaller. The smaller inferred luminosity and narrower emission
beams will need to be considered in future calculations of the birth-rate of
the Galactic population.

complexity, our results presented here suggest that millisecond pulsar profiles
do not comply with the predictions of classification schemes based on
``normal'' pulsars. The frequency development of a large number of millisecond
pulsar profiles is abnormal when compared with the development seen for normal
pulsars. Moreover, the polarization characteristics suggest that
millisecond-pulsar magnetospheres might not simply represent scaled versions of
the magnetospheres of normal pulsars, supporting results of paper I. However,
phenomena such as mode-changing activity in both intensity and polarization are
recognized here for the first time (e.g., J1730--2304). This suggests that
while the basic emission mechanism remains insensitive to rotational period,
the conditions that, according to the canonical pulsar model, regulate the
radio emission, might be satisfied at different regions in millisecond pulsar
magnetospheres.
  At least three types of model have been proposed to describe the millisecond
pulsar magnetospheres. A comparison of the predictions of these models with the
observations suggests that individual cases are better explained by different
processes. However, we show that millisecond pulsars can be grouped according
to common emission properties, a grouping that awaits verification from future
multifrequency observations.

  The prominences of the jets detected do not appear to be a function of radio
luminosity, providing the clearest evidence yet that the reported low detection
rate of jets in radio galaxies has been an artefact of low-sensitivity
observations. We find a positive correlation between the total source length
and core prominence in the narrow-line radio galaxies. We have found evidence
for a relationship between hot spot size and total source size, but few other
significant relationships between hot spot properties and those of the jets or
lobes. We compare our measurements to those of Bridle et al (1994), based on
observations of a sample of quasars, and argue that the results are consistent
with a modification of the unified model in which the broad-line radio galaxies
are the low-luminosity counterparts of quasars, although the situation is
complicated by contamination with low-excitation radio galaxies which appear to
have radio properties different from the high-excitation objects. We discuss

deficit, $\Delta\Omega/4\pi = 8\pi G\eta^2$, where $\eta$ is the symmetry

can cover the lower part of the $\Delta m^2$ region of the currently allowed

explorable with planned long-baseline neutrino beam experiments. We stress that
experimentally this method relies on the ability to measure high energy muons

ideally suited for this measurement. The existing LEP detectors augmented with
atmospheric neutrino triggers could also be used to perform such a study.
