and neutron stars. Difference between stellar outflows and outflows from these
systems is that the outflows in these systems have to form out of the inflowing
material only. The inflowing material can form a hot and dense cloud
surrounding the compact object either because of centrifugal barrier or a
denser barrier due to pair plasma or pre-heating effects. This barrier behaves
like a stellar surface as far as the mass loss is concerned. We estimate the
outflow rate from such considerations. These estimated rates roughly match with
the rates in real observations as well as those obtained from numerical
experiments.

Brown's, Zak's, and other approaches. It also indicates the importance of the

projective representations and central extensions) are gauge-dependent, whereas
a commutator of two magnetic translations is gauge-independent. This result
indicates that a form of the vector potential (a gauge) is also important in

invariant even though the actions are not. As an application we use this gauge
transformation to map the action of a spinless point particle in a
Riemann-Cartan spacetime with a gradient torsion to a purely Riemann spacetime,
in which the initial torsion appears as a nongeometric external field. By
extremizing the transformed action in the usual way, we obtain the same
autoparallel equations of motion as those derived in the initial spacetime with
torsion via a recently-discovered variational principle.

radiation backreaction over one orbital period was developed in an earlier
paper. In the present paper we generalize this formalism to include the case of
a closed system composed from two bodies of comparable masses, one of them
having the spin S.
  We employ the equations of motion given by Barker and O'Connell, where terms
up to linear order in the spin (the spin-orbit interaction terms) are kept. To
obtain the radiative losses up to terms linear in the spin, the equations of
motion are taken to the same order. Then the magnitude L of the angular
momentum L, the angle kappa subtended by S and L and the energy E are
conserved. The analysis of the radial motion leads to a new parametrization of
the orbit.
  From the instantaneous gravitational radiation losses computed by Kidder the
leading terms and the spin-orbit terms are taken. Following Apostolatos,
Cutler, Sussman and Thorne, the evolution of the vectors S and L in the
momentary plane spanned by these vectors is separated from the evolution of the
plane in space. The radiation-induced change in the spin is smaller than the
leading-order spin terms in the momentary angular momentum loss. This enables
us to compute the averaged losses in the constants of motion E, L and L_S=L cos
kappa. In the latter, the radiative spin loss terms average to zero. An
alternative description using the orbital elements a,e and kappa is given.
  The finite mass effects contribute terms, comparable in magnitude, to the
basic, test-particle spin terms in the averaged losses.

from the three dimensional coherent states of the harmonic oscillator, from
