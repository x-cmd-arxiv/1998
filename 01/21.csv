morphologies of 194 spectroscopically confirmed members of the rich galaxy
cluster CL1358+62 at z=0.33. We study the color-magnitude (CM) relation as a
function of radius in the cluster. The intrinsic scatter in the restframe B-V
CM relation of the elliptical galaxies is very small: ~0.022 magnitudes. The CM
relation of the ellipticals does not depend significantly on the distance from
the cluster center. In contrast, the CM relation for the S0 galaxies does
depend on radius: the S0s in the core follow a CM relation similar to the
ellipticals, but at large radii (R>0.7Mpc) the S0s are systematically bluer and
the scatter in the CM relation approximately doubles to ~0.043 magnitudes. The
blueing of the S0s is significant at the 95% confidence level. These results
imply that the S0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster have formed stars
more recently than the S0s in the inner parts. A likely explanation is that
clusters at z=0.33 continue to accrete galaxies and groups from the field and
that infall extinguishes star formation. The apparent homogeneity of the
elliptical galaxy population implies that star formation in recently accreted
ellipticals was terminated well before accretion occurred. We have constructed
models to explore the constraints that these observations place on the star
formation history of cluster galaxies. We conclude that the population of S0s
in clusters is likely to evolve as star forming galaxies are converted into
passively evolving galaxies. Assuming a constant accretion rate after z=0.33,
we estimate ~15% of the present day early-type galaxy population in rich
clusters was accreted between z=0.33 and z=0. The ellipticals (and the
brightest S0s) are probably a more stable population, at least since z=0.6.

Alfv\'en waves in the creation of inhomogeneities in the winds of early-type

stars is often larger than expected. The clumping explains this characteristic
in the wind, increasing the mean density and hence the emission measure, making
possible to understand the observed infrared, as well as the observed
enhancement in the blue wing of the $H_\alpha$ line. In this study, we
investigate the formation of these clumps a via thermal instability. The
heat-loss function used, $H(T,n)$, includes physical processes such as:
emission of (continuous and line) recombination radiation; resonance line
emission excited by electron collisions; thermal bremsstrahlung; Compton
heating and cooling; and damping of Alfv\'en waves. As a result of this
heat-loss function we show the existence of two stable equilibrium regions. The
stable equilibrium region at high temperature is the diffuse medium and at low
temperature the clumps. Using this reasonable heat-loss function, we show that
the two stable equilibrium regions can coexist over a narrow range of pressures

properties of a large sample of dark matter halos evolving in a dense

from 0% at 200 kpc, to 13% at the virial radius. Even at this resolution the
overmerging problem persists; halos that pass within 200 kpc of the cluster

within the massive progenitor halos. The median ratio of apocentric to
pericentric radii is 6:1; the orbital distribution is close to isotropic,
circular orbits are rare, radial orbits are common. The orbits of halos are
unbiased with respect to both position within the cluster and with the orbits
of the smooth dark matter background and no velocity bias is detected. The
tidal radii of surviving halos are generally well-fit using the simple analytic
prediction applied to their orbital pericenters. Halos within clusters have
higher concentrations than those in the field. Within the cluster, halo density
profiles can be modified by tidal forces and individual encounters with other
halos that cause significant mass loss - ``galaxy harassment''. Mergers between

seems to be related to the quantity of gas in the galaxies) and $\kappa$ (an
average density contrast in the regions where quasars form). The obtained

strongly suggest that a large amount of MACHOs should actually consist of

that such an apparent paradox does not exist within a model in which MACHOs are

from the current debate on the fractal dimension D and maximum scale of
fractality. To study this question, we used a new method based on photometric
TF distances, independent of redshift, to construct the number density
distribution. Our main results are:
  (1) While scattered below about 20 Mpc, at larger distances the radial
distribution starts to follow, in terms of distance modulus mu_TF, the law log
N = 0.46 mu + const., using diameter TF relation, and log N = 0.40 mu + const.
for magnitudes. These are the predictions based on fractal dimensions 2.3 and
2.0, respectively. These radial density gradients are valid up to the limits of
KLUN, or about 200 Mpc.
  (2) We have tried to understand the derived radial density behaviour as a
result of some bias in KLUN or our analysis, however, without success.
Numerical simulations have shown that the method itself works. If the density
law is caused by incompleteness in the diameter limited KLUN sample, then the
incompleteness should start at widely different angular diameters d_25 for
different values of rotation parameter log V_M, which would be quite
unexpected.
  (3) If correlation studies favoring long scale fractality (200 Mpc or more)
and D ~ 2 are correct, the position of our Galaxy would be close to average in
the Universe, with the galaxy density decreasing around us according to the
expected law.

in one dimension is analyzed in which the generalized transition probability
leads to a fast convergence of the cost function to the optimal value. We also
investigate how far our arguments depend upon the specific form of the
generalized transition probability proposed by Tsallis and Stariolo. It is
shown that a few requirements on analyticity of the transition probability are
sufficient to assure fast convergence in the case of the solvable model in one
dimension.

equation corresponds to the Regge-Wheeler result (Phys. Rev. 108, 1063-1069

quasilocality which does duty for the separation of the angular variables in
the usual approach. Moreover, there is no need to represent perturbations by
normal modes (with time dependence $\exp(-ikt)$), we have fields in spacetime
and the Cauchy problem for them is well defined outside of the horizon. The
reduced symplectic structure explains the origin of the axial and polar
invariants. It allows to introduce an energy and angular momentum for the
gravitational waves which is invariant with respect to the gauge
transformations. Both generators represent quadratic approximation of the ADM
nonlinear formulae in terms of the perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric.

present in all cases a crude estimate of the number of cos(2beta) (respectively

function of the resonance mass, a favorable situation compared to the more
extensively studied three-pion Dalitz plot. However, the poor detection
efficiency of the D mesons could pose a problem. As an annex and speculative

have applications to the study of blow--up of solutions of semilinear PDE, time
dependent Sturm Liouville theory, curve shrinking problems and control theory.
We generalise the PDE results by showing that the transition operator of a
(possibly time--inhomogenous) one--dimensional diffusion reduces the number of
zero--crossings of a function or even, suitably interpreted, a signed measure.
Our proof is completely probabilistic and depends in a transparent manner on
little more than the sample--path continuity of diffusion processes.

the large potential of double beta decay to search for new physics beyond the
Standard Model. To increase by a major step the present sensitivity for double
beta decay and dark matter search much bigger source strengths and much lower
backgrounds are needed than used in experiments under operation at present or
under construction. We present here a study of a project proposed recently,
which would operate one ton of 'naked' enriched GErmanium-detectors in liquid
NItrogen as shielding in an Underground Setup (GENIUS). It improves the
sensitivity to neutrino masses to 0.01 eV. A ten ton version would probe
neutrino masses even down to 10^-3 eV. The first version would allow to test
the atmospheric neutrino problem, the second at least part of the solar
neutrino problem. Both versions would allow in addition significant
contributions to testing several classes of GUT models. These are especially
tests of R-parity breaking supersymmetry models, leptoquark masses and
mechanism and right-handed W-boson masses comparable to LHC. The second issue
of the experiment is the search for dark matter in the universe. The entire
MSSM parameter space for prediction of neutralinos as dark matter particles
could be covered already in a first step of the full experiment - with the same
purity requirements but using only 100 kg of 76Ge or even of natural Ge -
making the experiment competitive to LHC in the search for supersymmetry.
  The layout of the proposed experiment is discussed and the shielding and
purity requirements are studied using GEANT Monte Carlo simulations. As a
demonstration of the feasibility of the experiment first results of operating a
'naked' Ge detector in liquid nitrogen are presented.

expression for the nuclear structure function in terms of nuclear spectral
function and off-shell nucleon structure functions valid for arbitrary momentum
transfer Q and in the limit of weak nuclear binding, i.e. when a nucleus can be
treated as a non-relativistic system. We develop a systematic expansion of
nuclear structure functions in terms of Q^{-2} series caused by nuclear effects
(""nuclear twist"" series). Basing on this expansion we calculate nuclear
corrections to the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rule as well as to higher moments
of F_3. We show that corrections to the GLS sum rule due to nuclear effects
cancel out in the Bjorken limit and calculate the corresponding Q^{-2}
correction. Special attention is payed to the discussion of the off-shell
effects in the structure functions. A sizable impact of these effects both on
Q^2- and x-dependence of nuclear structure functions is found.

consider the scattering from unpolarized and polarized targets as well as
processes where the polarization of the recoil deuteron is measured. Our main
motivation results from the need for a quantitative analysis of the space-time
structure of photon-induced processes. In this respect we suggest several
possibilities to explore the characteristic longitudinal interaction length in
coherent vector meson production. Furthermore, we outline methods for an
investigation of color coherence effects. In addition to the presentation of
benchmark values for the maximal possible color coherence effect in various
kinematic regions, we illustrate the anticipated phenomena within the color
diffusion model. Finally we recall that the determination of vector
meson-nucleon cross sections is not a closed issue. Besides being not known to
a satisfying accuracy, they can be used to determine the strength of the
D-state in low mass vector mesons.
