surveys, and high-redshift observations can potentially determine the nature of
the dark matter observationally. With this in mind, we introduce a
phenomenological model for a generalized dark matter (GDM) component and
discuss its effect on large-scale structure and CMB anisotropies. Specifying
the gravitational influence of the otherwise non-interacting GDM requires not
merely a model for its equation of state but one for its full stress tensor.
  From consideration of symmetries, conservation laws, and gauge invariance, we
construct a simple but powerful 3 component parameterization of these stresses
that exposes the new phenomena produced by GDM. Limiting cases include: a
particle component (e.g. WIMPS, radiation or massive neutrinos), a cosmological
constant, and a scalar field component. Intermediate cases illustrate how the
clustering properties of the dark matter can be specified independently of its
equation of state. This freedom allows one to alter the amplitude and features
in the matter power spectrum relative to those of the CMB anisotropies while
leaving the background cosmology fixed. Conversely, observational constraints
on such properties can help determine the nature of the dark matter.

account the gravitational potential of their dominant dark matter haloes. We
explore supernova rates from one every 30,000 yr to one every 3 million yr,
equivalent to steady mechanical luminosities of L=0.1-10 x 10^38 ergs/s,
occurring in dwarf galaxies with gas masses M_g=10^6 - 10^9 solar masses. We
address in detail, both analytically and numerically, the following three
questions:
  1. When do the supernova ejecta blow out of the disk of the galaxy?
  2. When blowout occurs, what fraction of the interstellar gas is blown away,
escaping the potential of the galactic halo?
  3. What happens to the metals ejected from the massive stars of the
starburst? Are they retained or blown away?
  We give quantitative results for when blowout will or will not occur in
galaxies with 10^6 \leq M_g \leq 10^9 solar masses. Surprisingly, we find that
the mass ejection efficiency is very low for galaxies with mass M_g \geq 10^7
solar masses. Only galaxies with M_g \leq 10^6 solar masses have their
interstellar gas blown away, and then virtually independently of L. On the
other hand, metals from the supernova ejecta are accelerated to velocities
larger than the escape speed from the galaxy far more easily than the gas. We
find that for L_38=1, only about 30% of the metals are retained by a 10^9 solar
mass galaxy, and virtually none by smaller galaxies. We discuss the
implications of our results for the evolution, metallicity and observational
properties of dwarf galaxies.

the tip of a faint northeast plume of Mrk 273. Its spectrum exhibits strong
[OIII], Halpha, [NII] emission lines, which establish the redshift of the dwarf
galaxy, $z=0.0376$, the same as that of Mrk 273. The emission line ratios are
typical of Seyfert galaxies. The X-ray emission is consistent with a point-like
source coincident with the center of the dwarf galaxy. The intrinsic X-ray
luminosity, 6.3x10^{41} ergs, in the 0.1--2.4 keV energy range, is about seven
times larger than the B band luminosity. The X-ray spectrum of the source can
be fit with a power-law. All the evidence is consistent with the source being a
Seyfert galaxy. It is mysterious why out of $\sim 10$ faint objects in the same
field only one is detected by ROSAT and its ratio of soft X-ray to optical
luminosity is as high as those for BL Lac objects and few active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). If there is a population of such dwarf AGNs hidden as companions
of major merger galaxies (such as Mrk 273), they may contribute to the
luminosity function of AGNs and the cosmic X-ray background at the faint end.

Inspired by the inflationary scenario in the early Universe, we set the
Einstein-de Sitter fixed point with small fluctuations, as the boundary
condition at the horizon scale. Solving the RG equations under this boundary
condition toward the smaller scales, we find generic behavior of observables
such that the density parameter $\Omega$ decreases, while the Hubble parameter
$H$ increases for smaller averaging volume. The quantitative scaling properties
are analyzed by calculating the characteristic exponents around each fixed
point. Finally we argue the possible fractal structure of the Universe beyond
the horizon scale.
