Cepheid distances to over a dozen galaxies have now been measured using HST.
These distances form the basis for the calibration of a number of secondary
distance indicators including the Tully-Fisher relation and type Ia supernovae.
Substantial progress has been made in placing empirical limits on the effects
of varying metal abundance on the derived Cepheid distances. The Key Project
data are consistent with a small effect of -0.24 +/- 0.16 mag/dex. The value of
the Hubble constant is presently determined to be 73 +/- 6 (statistical) +/- 8
km/sec/Mpc, based upon a number of methods. A summary of the recent calibration
of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation using Hipparcos is also given.

to be most pronounced at a frequency of about 350 GHz (a wavelength of about
800 microns), and has been detected in the centimetre and millimetre wavebands.
In the millimetre/submillimetre waveband, the gravitationally-lensed images of
distant dusty star-forming galaxies in the background of the cluster are
predicted to dominate the appearance of clusters on scales of several
arcseconds, and could confuse observations of the SZ effect at frequencies
greater than about 200 GHz (wavelengths shorter than about 1.5 mm). Recent
observations by Smail, Ivison & Blain (1997) confirm that a significant
population of confusing sources are present in this waveband. Previous
estimates of source confusion in observations of the
millimetre/submillimetre-wave SZ effect did not include the effects of lensing
by the cluster, and so the accuracy of such measurements could be lower than
expected. Source subtraction may be required in order to measure the SZ effect
accurately, and a careful analysis of the results of an ensemble of SZ
measurements could be used to impose limits to the form of evolution of distant
star-forming galaxies.

black holes could form during a first-order QCD phase transition. Further, it
has been asserted that these black holes would have masses corresponding
naturally to the inferred mass ($\sim 1 M_{\odot}$) of the MACHOs responsible
for the observed gravitational microlensing events. In this model, the
underlying spectrum of primordial density perturbations provides the
fluctuations that give rise to black holes at the epoch of the QCD transition.
We employ a simplified model to estimate the reduction in the critical
overdensity of a horizon-sized primordial perturbation required for collapse to
a black hole. We find that a first-order QCD transition does indeed produce a
sharp peak in the black hole mass spectrum, but that this peak corresponds to
the horizon mass at an epoch somewhat earlier than the cosmological transition
itself. Assuming a COBE normalized primordial density perturbation spectrum
with constant spectral index, for the black holes so produced to be
cosmologically significant would require an extremely finely tuned ``blue''
primordial density perturbation spectrum. Specifically, in the context of our
simplified model, a spectral index in the range $n=1.37-1.42$ corresponds to
the range $\Omega \sim 10^{-5}-10^3$ of the black hole contribution to the
present-day density parameter.

associated to gravitational collapses of massive stars, and hence evolution of
the GRB rate, which is crucially important in GRB intensity distribution
analysis, is determined by the cosmic star formation history. Here we present
complementary results of GRB logN-logP analysis, which were omitted in the
previous paper (Totani 1997, ApJ, 486, L71). A unique feature of the binary
neutron-star merger scenario, in contrast to other scenarios associated to
single stellar collapses, is that a time delay during binary spiral-in phase
emitting gravitational waves is not negligible and makes the rate evolution
flatter than that of star formation rate. We show that binary merger scenario
is more favored than single stellar collapses. The estimated peak luminosity
and total emitted energy in rest-frame 50-300 keV range is 1--3 $\times 10^{51}
(\Omega / 4 \pi)$ erg/s and 1--3 $\times 10^{52} (\Omega / 4 \pi)$ erg,
respectively, where $\Omega$ is opening angle of gamma-ray emission. Absolute
rate comparison between GRBs and neutron-star mergers suggests that a beaming
factor of $(\Omega/4\pi)^{-1} \sim$ a few hundreds is required. High-$z$ SFR
data ($z>2$) based on UV luminosity need to be corrected upwards by a factor of
5--10 for a good fit, and this is likely explained by the dust extinction

new magnetohydrodynamic picture of the flaring region revealed with Yohkoh. An
oblique fast shock is naturally formed below the reconnection site, and boosts
the acceleration to significantly decrease the injection energy. The slow
shocks attached to the reconnection X-point heat the plasma up to 10--20 MK,
exceeding the injection energy. The combination of the oblique shock
configuration and the pre-heating by the slow shock allows bulk electron
acceleration from the thermal pool. The accelerated electrons are trapped
between the two slow shocks due to the magnetic mirror downstream of the fast
shock, thus explaining the impulsive loop-top hard X-ray source discovered with
Yohkoh. Acceleration time scale is ~ 0.3--0.6 s, which is consistent with the
time scale of impulsive bursts. When these electrons stream away from the
region enclosed by the fast shock and the slow shocks, they are released toward
the footpoints and may form the simultaneous double-source hard X-ray structure
at the footpoints of the reconnected field lines.

whether its red colour is genuinely due to an old population of stars. Second,
assuming that all the light is indeed due to stars, it has been claimed that
53W091 is in fact only 1-2 Gyr old. Here I present a preliminary analysis of

exponential self-interaction. We analyze this field theory perturbatively and
non-perturbatively through the renormalization group(RG).We show scaling
behaviour (critical) for a continuous range of the physical parameters as the
temperature. We derive in this framework the scaling relation M(R) \sim R^{d_H}
for the mass on a region of size R, and Delta v \sim R^\frac12(d_H -1) for the
velocity dispersion. For the density-density correlations we find a power-law
behaviour for large distances \sim |r_1 - r_2|^{2D - 6}.The fractal dimension D
turns to be related with the critical exponent \nu by D = 1/ \nu. Mean field
theory yields \nu = 1/2, D = 2. Both the Ising and the mean field values are
compatible with the present ISM observational data:1.4\leq D \leq 2. We develop
a field theoretical approach to the galaxy distribution considering a gas of
self-gravitating masses on the FRW background, in quasi-thermal equi- librium.
We show that it exhibits scaling behaviour by RG methods. The galaxy
correlations are computed without assuming homogeneity. We find <\rho({\vec
r_0})\rho({\vec r_0} + {\vec r}) > \sim r^{D-3} $. The theory allows to compute
the three and higher density correlators without any assumption.We find that

techniques used previously to derive the generalized Boltzmann equation for the
time dependent spatial and velocity distribution functions for such systems. We
extend the variables in the generalized Boltzmann equation to include a new set
of quantities that describe the separation of trajectories in phase space
needed for a calculation of the Lyapunov exponents. The method described here
is especially suitable for calculating the sum of all of the positive Lyapunov
exponents for the system, and may be applied to equilibrium as well as
non-equilibrium situations. For low densities we obtain an extended Boltzmann
equation, from which, under a simplifying approximation, we recover the sum of
positive Lyapunov exponents for hard disk and hard sphere systems, obtained
before by a simpler method. In addition we indicate how to improve these
results by avoiding the simplifying approximation. The restriction to hard
sphere systems in $d$-dimensions is made to keep the somewhat complicated
formalism as clear as possible, but the method can be easily generalized to
apply to gases of particles that interact with strong short range forces.

analyzing invariance properties of the Lagrangian, as one does for the Euler
equations for the rigid body and ideal fluids, we first transform this action
principle into purely Eulerian variables. Hamilton's principle for the Eulerian
description of Low's action principle then casts the Maxwell-Vlasov equations
into Euler-Poincare form for right invariant motion on the diffeomorphism group
of position-velocity phase space, R^6. Legendre transforming the Eulerian form
of Low's action principle produces the Hamiltonian formulation of these
equations in the Eulerian description. Since it arises from Euler-Poincare
equations, this Hamiltonian formulation can be written in terms of a Poisson
structure that contains the Lie-Poisson bracket on the dual of a semidirect

Maxwell-Vlasov Poisson structure is known, whose ingredients are the
Lie-Poisson bracket on the dual of the Lie algebra of symplectomorphisms of

order to properly describe quantum transitions occurring around a black hole.
The introduction of this boundary term has been advocated by Teitelboim and
collaborators and it has been used in the computation of the black hole
entropy. Here, we use it to compute the gravitational corrections to the
transition amplitudes giving rise to Hawking radiation. This surface term
implies that the probability to emit a particle is given by $e^{- \Delta A/4}$
where $\Delta A$ is the change in the area of the black hole horizon induced by
the emission. Its inclusion at the level of the amplitudes therefore relates
quantum black hole radiation to the first law of black hole dynamics. In both
cases indeed, the term expressing the change in area directly results from the
same boundary term introduced for the same reason: to obtain a well defined
action principle.

fivebrane configuration. From the brane point of view, supersymmetry is broken
when a holomorphic configuration with the proper boundary conditions does not
exist. We discuss the difference between explicit and spontaneous supersymmetry
breaking and between runaway behavior and having a stable vacuum. As a
preparation for the study of the IYIT model, we examine a realization of the
orientifold four-plane in M theory. We derive known as well as new results on
the moduli spaces of N=2 and N=1 theories with symplectic gauge groups. These
results are based on a hypothesis that a certain intersection of the fivebrane
and the Z_2 fixed plane breaks supersymmetry. In the IYIT model, we show that
the brane exhibits runaway behavior when the flavor group is gauged. On the
other hand, if the flavor group is not gauged, we find that the brane does not
run away. We suggest that a stable supersymmetry-breaking vacuum is realized in
the region beyond the reach of the supergravity approximation.

(PBB) inflation must be greater than $10^{19}$ $l_s$, where $l_s$ is the
stringy length. The total mass of an inflationary domain must be greater than
$10^{72} M_{s}$, where $M_{s} \sim l_s^{-1}$. If the universe is initially
radiation dominated, then its total entropy at that time must be greater than
$10^{68}$. If the universe is closed, then at the moment of its formation it
must be uniform over $10^{24}$ causally disconnected domains. The natural
duration of the PBB stage in this scenario is $M_p^{-1}$. We argue that the
initial state of the open PBB universe could not be homogeneous because of
quantum fluctuations. Independently of the issue of homogeneity, one must
introduce two large dimensionless parameters, $g_0^{-2} > 10^{53}$, and $B >
10^{91}$, in order to solve the flatness problem in the PBB cosmology. A regime
of eternal inflation does not occur in the PBB scenario. This should be
compared with the simplest versions of the chaotic inflation scenario, where
the regime of eternal inflation may begin in a universe of size $O(M_{p}^{-1})$
with vanishing initial radiation entropy, mass $O(M_p)$, and geometric entropy
O(1). We conclude that the current version of the PBB scenario cannot replace
usual inflation even if one solves the graceful exit problem in this scenario.

peak field strength. Results are presented from numerical

security against a very important class of attacks called collective attacks

which are directed against the final key. Although attacks stronger than the
collective attacks can exist in principle, no explicit example was found and it
is conjectured that security against collective attacks implies also security

couple the vibrational manifolds of separate magnetic sublevels. Using these
couplings one can evolve the state of a trapped atom in a quantum coherent
fashion, and prepare pure quantum states by resolved-sideband Raman cooling. We
explore the use of atoms bound in optical lattices to study quantum tunneling
and the generation of macroscopic superposition states in a double-well
potential. Far-off-resonance optical potentials lend themselves particularly
well to reservoir engineering via well controlled fluctuations in the
potential, making the atom/lattice system attractive for the study of
decoherence and the connection between classical and quantum physics.
