temporal decay of the UHECR-induced high-energy $\gamma$-ray afterglows is
significantly slower than that of the lower-energy burst and associated
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation, which provides a direct way to test
the hadronic origin of a high-energy GRB afterglow. Besides testing the UHECR
origin hypothesis, the short wavelength emission and afterglows can be used to
probe the level of the diffuse intergalactic infrared radiation field or

arising in the gas associated with M87. These are only lines from neutral and
very low ionization species blueshifted by ~150 km/s relative to the M87
systemic velocity, indicating a net gas outflow and turbulence. The excitation
sensitive emission line ratios suggest that shocks may be the dominant energy
supplier.
  The nuclear source in M87 is significantly variable. From the FOS target
acquisition data, we have established that the flux from the optical nucleus
varies by a factor ~2 on time scales of ~2.5 months and by as much as 25% over
3 weeks, and remains unchanged (<2.5%) on time scales of ~1 day. These
timescales limit the physical size of the emitting region to a few hundred
gravitational radii. The variability, combined with other observed spectral
properties, strongly suggest that M87 is intrinsically of BL Lac type but is
viewed at an angle too large to reveal the classical BL Lac properties.

of stochastic orbits in frequency space. The objects of fundamental importance
in structuring phase space are found to be the 3-dimensional resonant tori;
even when stable, such tori are not necessarily associated with periodic orbits
as in systems with only two degrees of freedom. Boxlike orbits are generically
stochastic, but some tube orbits are stochastic as well. The spectrum of
diffusion rates for box-like orbits at a given energy is well approximated as a
power law over at least six decades. Models with high central concentrations --
steep central cusps or massive black holes -- exhibit the most stochasticity. A
black hole with a mass of 0.3% the mass of the galaxy is as effective as the
steepest central density cusp at inducing stochastic diffusion. There is a
transition to global stochasticity in box-like phase space when the mass of a
central black hole exceeds 2% the galaxy mass. We predict a greater average
degree of dynamical evolution in faint ellipticals, due to their high central
densities and short crossing times. The evolution time is estimated to be
shorter than a galaxy lifetime for absolute magnitudes fainter than about -19

spin-down with nearly the same torques, leading to little net angular momentum
gained by accretion. I also summarize recent discoveries with the Rossi X-Ray

upper limit on the bolometric X-ray flux within a circle of radius 1.5 arcmin
is 1.9 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 at 99.7% significance. This is based on data in
the energy range 0.5-2.0 keV and assumes bremsstrahlung with an observed
temperature of 2.5 keV. We investigate the requirements for a spherical body of
hot gas to produce the decrement while remaining consistent with our data. With
conservative assumptions we establish a lower redshift limit of 2.8 at 95%
confidence for a 10 keV isothermal object of any size. Even higher limits
obtain for objects with temperatures between 0.2 and 10 keV. We conclude that
the CMB decrement is unlikely to be caused by a galaxy cluster. We discuss
alternatives to a single, spherical cluster, such as a double or elongated
cluster, a supercluster/filament, or scattering by a moving cluster. None of
these appears attractive, especially since another candidate for a decrement
near a QSO pair and without an obvious associated cluster has been found. An
explanation other than Comptonization by hot gas within a virialised object

Compton) produces the hard X-ray spectra in both classes. Contrary to the

a substantial population of disk brown dwarfs, $\Sigma_{BD}/\Sigma_*\leq 1 $.
More statistics of microlensing events towards the Galactic center and a better

this model is qualitatively similar to that of the corresponding random-field
model. Due to the discretization, for small $x$ at low temperature there is a
[110] FM phase. For $x>0$ there is an intermediate quasi-long-range ordered
(QLRO) phase between the paramagnet and the ferromagnet, which is characterized
by a $|k|^{-3}$ divergence of the magnetic structure factor S$(k)$ for small
$k$, but no true FM order. At the transition between the paramagnetic and QLRO
phases S$(k)$ diverges like $|k|^{-2}$. The limit of stability of the QLRO
phase is somewhat greater than $x=0.5$. For $x$ close to 1 the low temperature
form of S$(k)$ can be fit by a Lorentzian, with a correlation length estimated
to be $11 \pm 1$ at $x=1.0$ and $25 \pm 5$ at $x=0.75$.

perturbative string theory is exhibited, based on a formulation of the
non-perturbative dynamics due to Markopoulou. In this formulation the dynamics
of spin network states and their generalizations is described in terms of
histories which have discrete analogues of the causal structure and many
fingered time of Lorentzian spacetimes. Perturbations of these histories turn
out to be described in terms of spin systems defined on 2-dimensional timelike
surfaces embedded in the discrete spacetime. When the history has a classical
limit which is Minkowski spacetime, the action of the perturbation theory is
given to leading order by the spacetime area of the surface, as in bosonic
string theory. This map between a non-perturbative formulation of quantum
gravity and a 1+1 dimensional theory generalizes to a large class of theories
in which the group SU(2) is extended to any quantum group or supergroup. It is
argued that a necessary condition for the non-perturbative theory to have a
good classical limit is that the resulting 1+1 dimensional theory defines a
consistent and stable perturbative string theory.

of the four-dimensional QCD leads to quark confinement in the sense of area law
of the Wilson loop. First, Yang-Mills theory with a non-Abelian gauge group G
is reformulated as a deformation of a novel topological field theory. Next, a
special class of topological field theories is defined by both BRST and
anti-BRST exact action corresponding to the maximal Abelian gauge leaving the
maximal torus group H of G invariant. Then we find the topological field theory
($D>2$) has a hidden supersymmetry for a choice of maximal Abelian gauge. As a
result, the D-dimensional topological field theory is equivalent to the
(D-2)-dimensional coset G/H non-linear sigma model in the sense of Parisi and
Sourlas dimensional reduction. After maximal Abelian gauge fixing, the
topological property of magnetic monopole and anti-monopole of four-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory is translated into that of instanton and anti-instanton in
two-dimensional equivalent model. It is shown that the linear static potential
in four-dimensions follows from the instanton--anti-instanton gas in the
equivalent two-dimensional non-linear sigma model obtained from the
four-dimensional topological field theory by dimensional reduction, while the
remaining Coulomb potential comes from the perturbative part in
four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. The dimensional reduction opens a path for
applying various exact methods developed in two-dimensional quantum field
theory to study the non-perturbative problem in low-energy physics of
four-dimensional quantum field theories.

effect has become visible in the beautiful NA50 data on J/\psi production and
the `anomalous supression' phenomenon. On the other hand, it is still widely
believed that the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at CERN SPS energy is
predominantly governed by soft, non-perturbative physics. This is ironic: after
all, it is unlikely that a QGP could be formed if the underlying dynamics were
essentyially soft, rather than that it requires intense quark-gluon production
with sufficient cascade-like reinteractions which drive the matter to large
density and equilibrium. Therefore, I advocate in this contribution that for
ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions a description based on the pQCD
interactions and cascade evolution of involved partons can and should be used,
owing to the claim that short-range parton interactions play an important role
at sufficiently high beam energies, including CERN energy sqrt(s) = 20 A GeV.
Here mini-jet production which liberates of quarks and gluons cannot be
considered as an isolated rare phenomenon, but can occur quite copiously and
may lead to complex multiple cascade-type processes.

backward spin-polarizability, ""delta"" = 27.1 +/-2.2(stat+sys) +2.8/-2.4(model)

are dominated by pi0 t-channel exchange, and indicates a new contribution from
the non-perturbative spin-structure of the proton. This new value for ""delta""
removes an apparent inconsistency in the difference of charge polarizabilities
extracted from data above pi-threshold. Our global result, alpha-beta = 10.11
+/-1.74(stat+sys) +1.22/-0.86 (model) in units of 10^-4 fm^3, is consistent
with the previous world average of data below 155 MeV. Our value for alpha+beta
