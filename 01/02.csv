significant contributers to the integrated star formation at these epochs. For

the presence of two relaxation times, one linear, one quadratic in the

a cross-over to conventional Fermi liquid behavior. At strong-coupling,
marginal Fermi liquid behavior is pre-empted by a pairing or magnetic

testing the physics beyond the standard model.
