  Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics","Astron.Astrophys.337:379-392,1998",,"MPA 1073","astro-ph",,"  We present the results of two-dimensional calculations of turbulent nuclear
burning of hydrogen-rich material accreted onto a white dwarf of 1 solar mass.
The main aim of the present paper is to investigate the question as to whether
and how the general properties of the burning are affected by numerical
resolution effects. In particular, we want to see whether or not convective
overshooting into the surface layers of the C+O white dwarf can lead to
self-enrichment of the initially solar composition of the hydrogen-rich
envelope with carbon and oxygen from the underlying white dwarf core. Our
explicit hydrodynamic code is based on the PPM-method and computes the onset of
the thermonuclear runaway on a Cartesian grid. In contrast to previous works we
do not observe fast mixing of carbon and oxygen from the white dwarf's surface
into the envelope by violent overshooting of large eddies. The main features of
the flow fields in our simulations are the appearance of small persistent
coherent structures of very high vorticity (and velocity) compared to the
background flow. Their typical linear scales are about 10 to 20 grid zones and
thus their physical size depends on the numerical resolution, i.e, their size
decreases with increasing resolution. The two simulations (low and high
resolution) which are presented here show only moderate differences in
spatially integrated quantities such as laterally averaged temperature, energy
generation rate, and chemical composition. We have not expanded both
simulations equally long, but for the physical time under consideration the
major difference seems to be that the highly resolved simulation is a bit less
violent. In conclusion, we do find some self-enrichment, but on time-scales
much longer than in previous calculations.

similarly aligned feature just beyond the SE radio lobe has a redshift z=1.053,
quite close to that of the quasar. While the NW optical component is extremely
well aligned with the radio jet and has a morphology that is very similar to
that of the radio lobe lying 3"" interior to it, the fact that we find three
other field galaxies with closely similar redshifts indicates that it is most
likely a member of an intervening group rather than an unusual example of true

likely to be at redshifts >1.4. There are at least two low-redshift dwarf
starburst galaxies showing low metal abundance and high ionization in our

> 24) blue galaxies are low-mass objects that experienced a short epoch of star
formation at redshifts 0.5 < z < 1 and have since faded into low luminosity,
low surface brightness objects. Such a scenario, which arises naturally if star
formation in dwarf galaxies is delayed by photoionisation due to the
metagalactic UV radiation field, provides an attractive way to reconcile the
Einstein-de Sitter cosmological model to the steeply rising galaxy counts
observed at blue wavelengths. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) images provide a
stringent test of this model. We compare the Babul & Ferguson (1996) model to
the data by constructing using simulated images and carrying out source
detection and photometry for the simulations in the same way they were carried
out for the real data. We compare the model predictions for the counts, sizes,
and colours of galaxies observed in the HDF, and to the predictions from a low
q_0 pure-luminosity-evolution (PLE) model. Both models fail to reproduce the
observations. The low q_0 model predicts far more Lyman-break ``dropouts'' than
are seen in the data. The fading dwarf model predicts too many remnants: faded
dwarf galaxies in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.5 that should be detectable in
the HDF as low-surface brightness red objects but are not seen. If fading dwarf
galaxies are to reconcile the Einstein-de Sitter geometry to the counts, then
the dwarf population must (a) form earlier than z ~ 1, with a higher initial
luminosity; (b) have an initial-mass function more heavily weighted toward
massive stars than the Salpeter IMF; or (c) expand much more than assumed
during the supernova wind phase.

interpretation of galaxy counts, sizes and redshift distributions in the Hubble
Deep Field. Comparison of the different HDF catalogs available in the
literature and on the world-wide-web reveals generally good agreement, although
the effects of different isophotal thresholds and different splitting
algorithms are readily apparent. As the basic source detection and photometry
algorithms are similar for the different catalogs, the selection effects are
likely to affect them all. Through simulations, we explore the utility of image
moments for inferring the true sizes of galaxies. The truncation of galaxy
profiles at a fixed isophote has serious consequences, which limit constraints
on the size distribution to galaxies with isophotal magnitudes I < 27.5.
Present-day L* spirals would be undetected in the HDF above redshifts z ~ 1.2,
and present-day ellipticals would disappear at z ~ 1.8. The Lyman break
provides a way to identify high-redshift galaxies at very faint magnitudes.
However, galaxies that are at redshifts high enough to vanish from the HDF
F300W or F450W filters also suffer severely from photometric biases. For
example, at fixed total apparent magnitude and physical scale length, a galaxy
at z=4 will have a mean surface brightness 1.2 mag fainter than a galaxy at
z=2.75. This lower surface brightness will result in an apparent decrease in
the number density of objects, and the inferred luminosity density, even for
models where there is no intrinsic evolution. We illustrate the effects of
these biases on the estimates of the number of Lyman ``dropouts'' in the HDF
and on the luminosity density at z > 2.

electrodynamics. It is assumed that a dc current flows in the 2DES. We consider
a propagation of an electromagnetic wave through the structure, and obtain
analytic dependencies of the transmission, reflection, absorption and emission
coefficients on the frequency of light, drift velocity of 2D electrons, and
other physical and geometrical parameters of the system. If the drift velocity
of 2D electrons exceeds a threshold value, a current-driven plasma instability
is developed in the system, and an incident far infrared radiation is
amplified. We show that in the structure with a quantum wire grating the
threshold velocity of the amplification can be essentially reduced, as compared
to the commonly employed metal grating, down to experimentally achievable
values. Physically this is due to a considerable enhancement of the grating
coupler efficiency because of the resonant interaction of plasma modes in the

the correlation functions are obtained as solutions of a set a coupled partial
differential equations with magnetization, temperature and disorder strength as

existence of a classical Poisson bracket algebra induced, in a consistent
manner by the correspondence principle, mapping the quantum generators into
commuting objects of classical nature preserving their algebra.

Bose-symmetrized states which are not the product of pairwise correlations.
Usually they are neglected in particle interferometric calculations which aim
at determining the geometry of the boson emitting source from the measured
momentum distributions. Based on a method introduced by Zajc and Pratt, we give
a calculation of all multiparticle symmetrization effects to the one- and
two-particle momentum spectra for a Gaussian phase space distribution of
emission points. Our starting point is an ensemble of N-particle
Bose-symmetrized wavefunctions with specified phase space localization. In
scenarios typical for relativistic heavy ion collisions, multiparticle effects
steepen the slope of the one-particle spectrum for realistic particle phase
space densities by up to 20 MeV, and they broaden the relative momentum
dependence of the two-particle correlations. We discuss these modifications and
their consequences in quantitative detail. Also, we explain how multiparticle
effects modify the normalization of the two-particle correlator. The resulting
normalization conserves event probabilities, which is not the case for the
commonly used pair approximation. Finally, we propose a new method of
calculating Bose-Einstein weights from the output of event generators, taking
multiparticle correlations into account.

many-body states which are composed of antisymmetrized products of
single-particle states. These consist of one or several Gaussians localized in
coordinate and momentum space. The parameters specifying them are the dynamical
variables of the model. As the repulsive core of the nucleon-nucleon
interaction induces short range correlations which cannot be accommodated by a
Slater determinant, a novel approach, the unitary correlation operator method
(UCOM), is applied. The unitary correlator moves two particles away from each
other whenever their relative distance is within the repulsive core. The
time-dependent variational principle yields the equations of motion for the
variables. Energies of the stationary ground states are calculated and compared
to exact many-body results for nuclei up to Ca 48. Time-dependent solutions are
shown for collisions between nuclei.

potentials $V(x)=-x^4+2iax^3+(a^2-2b)x^2+2i(ab-J)x$ is introduced. Until now,
it was believed that the lowest-degree one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable
polynomial potential is sextic. This belief is based on the assumption that the
Hamiltonian must be Hermitian. However, it has recently been discovered that
there are huge classes of non-Hermitian, ${\cal PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians
whose spectra are real, discrete, and bounded below [physics/9712001].
Replacing Hermiticity by the weaker condition of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry allows
for new kinds of quasi-exactly solvable theories. The spectra of this family of
quartic potentials discussed here are also real, discrete, and bounded below,
and the quasi-exact portion of the spectra consists of the lowest $J$
eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are the roots of a $J$th-degree polynomial.

properties of the odd-integer moments are different from those of the

tunnels between minima of the external field. Two cases of the group $O$ are
classified, namely, 6- and 8-fold coordinations. The spectrum and degeneration
of energy levels depend on a remainder $\{J/n\}$, where the divisor $n=4$ and 3
for 6-fold and 8-fold coordination respectively. %High symmetry results in a
finite magnetic moment for half-integer %and some integer moments, for example
