alpha emission lines. We show that in both cases close companions are the most
likely cause of the chromospheric activity in these old, metal-poor stars. We
argue that Gl 781 A's unseen companion is most likely a cool helium white
dwarf. Gl 455 is a near-equal-mass M subdwarf (sdM) system. Gl 781 A is rapidly
rotating with v sin i = 30 km/s. The properties of the chromospheres and X-ray
coronae of these systems are compared to M dwarfs with emission (dMe). The
X-ray hardness ratios and optical chromospheric lines emission ratios are
consistent with those seen in dMe stars. Comparison to active near-solar
metallicity stars indicates that despite their low metallicity ([m/H] = -1/2),
the sdMe stars are roughly as active in both X-rays and chromospheric emission.
Measured by L_X/L_bol, the activity level of Gl 781 A is no more than a factor
of 2.5 subluminous with respect to near-solar metallicity stars.

containing a poloidal magnetic field is developed within the framework of ideal
magnetohydrodynamics. A continuous spectrum, for which the eigenfunctions are
localized on individual magnetic surfaces, is identified but is found not to
contain any instabilities associated with differential rotation. The normal
modes of a weakly magnetized thin disc are studied by extending the asymptotic
methods used previously to describe the equilibria. Waves propagate radially in
the disc according to a dispersion relation which is determined by solving an
eigenvalue problem at each radius. The dispersion relation for a hydrodynamic
disc is re-examined and the modes are classified according to their behaviour
in the limit of large wavenumber. The addition of a magnetic field introduces
new, potentially unstable, modes and also breaks up the dispersion diagram by
causing avoided crossings. The stability boundary to the magnetorotational
instability in the parameter space of polytropic equilibria is located by
solving directly for marginally stable equilibria. For a given vertical
magnetic field in the disc, bending of the field lines has a stabilizing effect
and it is shown that stable equilibria exist which are capable of launching a
predominantly centrifugally driven wind.

1997b), we we applied the method to a $cz_{LG} \leq 3000$ km/sec, 838-galaxy TF
sample and found $\beta_I=0.49\pm 0.07,$ where $\beta_I\equiv \Omega^{0.6}/b_I$
and $b_I$ is the linear biasing parameter for IRAS galaxies. In this paper we
increase the redshift limit to $cz_{LG}=7500$ km/sec, thereby enlarging the
sample to 1876 galaxies. The expanded sample now includes the W91PP and CF
subsamples of the Mark III catalog, in addition to the A82 and MAT subsamples
already considered in Paper I.
  We implement VELMOD using both the forward and inverse forms of the TF
relation, and allow for a more general form of the quadrupole velocity residual
detected in Paper I. We find $\beta_I=0.50\pm 0.04$ (1-sigma error) at 300
km/sec smoothing of the IRAS-predicted velocity field. The fit residuals are
spatially incoherent for $\beta_I=0.5,$ indicating that the IRAS plus
quadrupole velocity field is a good fit to the TF data. If we eliminate the
quadrupole we obtain a worse fit, but a similar value for $\beta_I$ of $0.54\pm
0.04.$ Changing the IRAS smoothing scale to 500 km/sec has almost no effect on
the best $\beta_I.$ We find evidence for a density-dependence of the
small-scale velocity dispersion, $\sigma_v(\delta_g)\simeq (100 + 35 \delta_g)$

to the optical and thus support the notion that the system is highly reddened.
The differing brightnesses at visible wavelengths are interpreted as variable
amounts of extinction in the lens galaxy. The lens galaxy is detected at K-band
and is as red as any other known galaxy of comparable apparent magnitude. An
estimate of the redshift of the lens galaxy of 0.45 < z < 0.6 is determined
from the Faber-Jackson relation and photometric considerations. By extension we

bluening of the spectrum, as expected if a blue FC was present at the nucleus

primarily analyzes the influence of the gas flows in non-axisymmetric
gravitational disturbances (like spiral arms and bars) on the behavior of the
magnetic field. The magnetic field is found to evolve towards structures
resembling dynamical spiral arms and bars, however its distribution is often
much more complicated than the velocity field itself. We show that a random
configuration of seed magnetic fields quickly dissipates, and is therefore
unable to explain the magnetic field strength observed in nearby galaxies. The
detailed comparison between the simulated velocity and magnetic fields allows
us to establish that the reversals of magnetic vectors appear in the vicinity

velocity field shows rather abrupt changes. We argue that this explains the
observed field reversals in our Galaxy.

previous claims, that this proposal leads to antidamping in the case of the
axionic field, and to zero (integrated) damping in the case of the
gravitational field. One gets normal positive damping only in the case of the
dilatonic field. We propose to use a suitably modified version of the local
dilatonic radiation reaction as a substitute for the exact (non-local)
gravitational radiation reaction. The incorporation of such a local
approximation to gravitational radiation reaction should allow one to complete,
in a computationally non-intensive way, string network simulations and to give
better estimates of the amount and spectrum of gravitational radiation emitted
by a cosmologically evolving network of massive strings.

tension is studied in detail. Two new items are included in this analysis: the
effect of the top quark Yukawa coupling and the QCD corrections to the
supersymmetric contributions to $\Delta m_K$. Even with Cabibbo-like degeneracy
between the squarks of the first two generations, these squarks must be heavier
than $\sim 40$ TeV to suppress $\Delta m_K$. This implies, in the case of a
high scale of supersymmetry breaking, that the boundary value of the stop mass
has to be greater than $\sim 7$ TeV to keep the stop mass squared positive at
the weak scale. Low-energy supersymmetry breaking at a scale that is of the
same order as the mass of the heavy scalars is also considered. In this case
the finite parts of the two-loop diagrams are computed to estimate the
contribution of the heavy scalar masses to the stop mass squared. It is found
that for Cabibbo-like mixing between the squarks, the stop mass at the boundary
needs to be larger than $\sim 2$ TeV. Thus, for both cases, the large boundary
value of the stop masses leads to an unnatural amount of fine tuning to obtain
the correct $Z$ mass.

theory are explained. Particularly, the web of constraints which follow from
supersymmetry and anomaly cancelation is argued to be more rich than previously
understood. In contradistinction to the lore on the subject, a consistent
classical theory describing the coupling of eleven dimensional supergravity to
super Yang-Mills theory constrained to the orbifold fixed points is suggested
to exist.
