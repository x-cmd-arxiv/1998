dimensional systems including dark matter, considered the thermal state of the

rate of shear instead of the epicyclic frequency. The model predictions were
compared to the azimuthally-averaged present day star formation activity traced
by the Halpha surface brightness, and to the 1 Gyr-integrated star formation
activity represented by the stellar surface brightness.
  The ratio of the observed gas density to the critical gas density is lower by
a factor of 2 in most of the Im galaxies than it is in spiral galaxies. Star
formation ends before this ratio drops significantly in the outer regions, and
it remains high in the inner regions where the ratio is often low. These
results suggest that the critical gas density does not trace star formation
with the same detail in irregular galaxies as it appears to trace it in giant
spiral galaxies. The only azimuthally-averaged quantity that correlates with
the current star formation activity in irregulars is the stellar surface
density. Theoretical implications are discussed.

revolutionized our ideas about the nature of these objects. They have shown
that GRBs are at cosmological distances. This idea was accepted with
difficulties at first. However, the recent discovery of an x-ray afterglow by
the Italian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX led to a detection of high red-shift
absorption lines in the optical afterglow of GRB970508 and to a confirmation of
its cosmological origin. The simplest and practically inevitable interpretation
of these observations is that GRBs result from the conversion of the kinetic
energy of ultra-relativistic particles flux to radiation in an optically thin
region. The ""inner engine"" that accelerates the particles or generates the
Poynting flux is hidden from direct observations. Recent studies suggest the
``internal-external'' model: internal shocks that take place within the
relativistic flow produce the GRB while the subsequent interaction of the flow
with the external medium produce the afterglow. The ``inner engine'' that
produces the flow is, however, hidden from direct observations. We review this
model with a specific emphasis on its implications to underground physics.

Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further
demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not

the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this
paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn
approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very
efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is
represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the
upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and
similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which
enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when
the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn
formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for
more complex updates.
