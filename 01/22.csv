X-ray emission comes from two distinct contributions. Nonthermal, synchrotron
emission, localized to a region of radius (~~)3' (consistent with a point
source) dominates the total flux above 2 keV. A second contribution comes from
a thermal component, extended up to a radius of (~~)6' and detected only at
energies below 2keV. The spatial and spectral analysis imply the presence of a
neutron star losing energy at a rate of about (10**36 - 10**37) ergs/s. No
pulsed emission is detected and we set a limit on the pulsed fraction of 10%.
This is consistent with the lack of a radio pulsar in the remnant, which may
indicate that the pulsed emission from the rapidly rotating compact object that
should be powering the synchrotron nebula is beamed and our viewing direction
is unfavorable. In either event, the central neutron star deposits much of its
spin-down energy into the surrounding synchrotron nebula where, through direct
imaging with broadband satellites such as ASCA, it is possible to study the
energetics and evolution of the compact remnant.

  We present and analyze Hubble Space Telescope observations of the eclipsing
nova-like cataclysmic variable UX UMa obtained with the Faint Object
Spectrograph. Two eclipses each were observed with the G160L grating (covering
the ultraviolet waveband) in August of 1994 and with the PRISM (covering the
near-ultraviolet to near-infrared) in November of the same year. The system was
50% brighter in November than in August, which, if due to a change in the
accretion rate, indicates a fairly substantial increase in Mdot_acc by >~ 50%.
  Model disk spectra constructed as ensembles of stellar atmospheres provide
poor descriptions of the observed post-eclipse spectra, despite the fact that
UX UMa's light should be dominated by the disk at this time. Suitably scaled
single temperature model stellar atmospheres with T_eff = 12,500-14,500 K
actually provide a better match to both the ultraviolet and optical
post-eclipse spectra. Evidently, great care must be taken in attempts to derive
accretion rates from comparisons of disk models to observations.
  One way to reconcile disk models with the observed post-eclipse spectra is to
postulate the presence of a significant amount of optically thin material in
the system. Such an optically thin component might be associated with the
transition region (``chromosphere'') between the disk photosphere and the fast
wind from the system, whose presence has been suggested by Knigge & Drew
(1997).

  Low amplitude (~=0.5%) 29-s oscillations have been detected in HST/FOS
eclipse observations of the nova-like cataclysmic variable UX UMa. These are
the same dwarf nova-type oscillations that were originally discovered in this
system by Warner & Nather in 1972. The oscillations are sinusoidal to within
the small observational errors and undergo an approximately -360 degree phase
shift during eclipses. Their amplitudes are highest at pre-eclipse orbital
phases and exhibit a rather gradual eclipse whose shape is roughly similar to
UX~UMa's overall light curve. Oscillation spectra derived from pre-eclipse data
segments are extremely blue, whereas mid-eclipse oscillation spectra are much
redder.
  We suggest that the ultimate source of the oscillations is a hot, compact
region near disk center, but that a significant fraction of the observed,
modulated flux is due to reprocessing of the light emitted by this source in
the accretion disk atmosphere. The compact source is occulted at orbital phases
near mid-eclipse, leaving only part of the more extended reprocessing region(s)
to produce the weak oscillations that persist even at conjunction.
  The highly sinusoidal oscillation pulse shape does not permit the
identification of the compact component in this model with emission produced by
a rotating disturbance in the inner disk or in an equatorial boundary layer,
and a standard intermediate polar model can also be ruled out. A model invoking
magnetically controlled accretion onto differentially rotating WD surface
layers may be viable, but needs more theoretical work.

has been used as pointer to galaxies with a high probability to contain active
nuclei. Only galaxies have been accepted for the program for which no activity

before. The optical spectra demonstrate that the galaxies cover a redshift
range of 0.014 to 0.13 and that most of them host active nuclei. For 75 percent
of the 33 candidates the X-ray emission is caused by the AGN. In addition
several of the remaining candidates host Seyfert 2/LINER nuclei that, however,
most certainly cannot explain the X-ray emission alone. Three BL Lac objects
have been detected serendipitously in galaxy fields that have been followed up

improved position accuracy and point response function. The sources show X-ray
to radio flux ratios typical for X-ray selected BL Lac objects. The results

growth of the error at large errors. It is proposed to adopt a generalization
of the Lyapunov exponent which is based on the natural concept of error growing
time at finite error size. The method is first illustrated on a simple

$z=3$ is studied using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method.
Ground-state properties such as the energy $E$, average local magnetization

correlation functions $<\hat S_z(i) \hat S_z(j) > - < S_z(i)> < S_z(j)>$ are
determined as a function of the Coulomb interaction strength $U/t$. The
calculated local magnetic moments $<\hat S_z(i)>$ increase monotonically with
increasing Coulomb repulsion $U/t$ forming an antiferromagnetic
spin-density-wave state which matches the two sublattices of the bipartite
Bethe lattice. At large $U/t$, $<\hat S_z(i)>$ is strongly reduced with respect
to the saturation value 1/2 due to exchange fluctuations between nearest
neighbors (NN) spins ($|< S_z(i)>|\simeq 0.35$ for $U/t\to +\infty$).
$<S_z(i)^2> - < S_z(i)>^2$ shows a maximum for $U/t=2.4$--2.9 which results
from the interplay between the usual increase of $<S_z(i)^2>$ with increasing
$U/t$ and the formation of important permanent moments $<S_z(i)>$ at large
$U/t$. NN sites show antiferromagnetic spin correlations which increase with
increasing Coulomb repulsion. In contrast next NN sites are very weakly
correlated over the whole range of $U/t$. The accuracy of the DMRG results is
discussed by comparison with tight-binding exact results, independent DMRG
calculations for the Heisenberg model and simple first-order perturbation

arising from neutrino-exchange. It is shown that the results of Abada, et al.

disagree with the lowest order 2-body contribution, which is known exactly.
This discrepancy raises the possibility that the description of a neutron star
as a continuous medium may be inappropriate when calculating higher-order
many-body effects. We conclude that none of the recent calculations contradict
the earlier claims that the neutrino-exchange contributions to the self-energy
of a neutron star are unphysically large, when calculated in the standard
model. The implication of this result, that neutrinos must have a non-zero
mass, m > 0.4 eV, remains intact.

Assuming a canonical Kahler potential we calculate the soft terms induced in

squared. If duality is still good for small supersymmetry breaking, this may
imply some specific symmetry breaking patterns for supersymmetric QCD with
small soft supersymmetry-breaking masses, in the case that its dual theory is
weakly coupled in the infrared. In the limit of large supersymmetry breaking,
the electric theory becomes ordinary QCD. However, the resulting symmetry
breaking in the magnetic theory is incompatible with that expected for QCD.

main contribution to the photon emission stems from Coulomb acceleration and
may be computed analytically. We find only a small contribution from the
tunneling wave function under the barrier.

relativity, quantum statistics, resonance decays, and freeze-out on a realistic
hypersurface in spacetime to analyze invariant pi+, K+, and K- one-particle
multiplicity distributions and pi+ and pi- two-particle correlations in nearly
central collisions of Pb + Pb at a laboratory bombarding momentum per nucleon
of 158 GeV/c. The adjustable parameters of the model are determined by
minimizing chi-square with a total of 2137 data points for the five types of
data considered, which leads to an acceptable value of 1.017 for chi-square per
degree of freedom. Compared to earlier results obtained with this model for
nearly central collisions of Si + Au at a laboratory bombarding momentum per
nucleon of 14.6 GeV/c, the present results indicate that in Pb + Pb collisions
the freeze-out density is somewhat lower, the freeze-out temperature is
slightly higher, the source at freeze-out is somewhat larger, and the
longitudinal collective velocity is very poorly determined (because of the
limited experimental coverage in rapidity). For both reactions, the freeze-out
temperature is less than 100 MeV and the longitudinal and transverse collective
velocities-which are anti-correlated with the temperature-are substantial. We
reconcile these results with those in several previous analyses that yielded a
much higher freeze-out temperature of approximately 140 MeV, and finally
perform two additional studies with our expanding source model.

using Glauber model. The continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov theory has been
generalized to treat the odd particle system and take the continuum into
account. The theory reproduces the experimental result quite well. The matter
distributions from the proton drip line to the neutron drip line in Na isotopes
have been systematically studied and presented. The relation between the shell
effects and the halos has been examined. The tail of the matter distribution
shows a strong dependence on the shell structure. The neutron N=28 closure
shell fails to appear due to the coming down of the $2p_{3/2}$ and $2p_{1/2}$.
The development of the halo was understood as changes in the occupation in the
next shell or the sub-shell close to the continuum limit. The central proton
density is found to be decreasing near the neutron drip line, which is due to
the proton-neutron interaction. However the diffuseness of the proton density
does not change for the whole Na isotopes.

over long times. These predictions are confirmed in experiments on H1, a
motion-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system.

analyzed. Comparing with the recently established internal properties of
electrons it is found, that these solutions cannot be seen as physically valid
states of the electron wave. The paper therefore proposes a new model of
hydrogen based on internal properties of electrons. The ground state of the
hydrogen system (T=0) is an inertial aggregation within the atomic shell, the
calculation yields an atomic radius of 0.330 nm. Electron proton interaction
within the atom are treated with a causal and deterministic model, the
resonance frequency of the hydrogen system of $ 6.57 \times 10^{15} Hz $ is
referred to elastic deformations of its nucleus, resonance levels are a result
of boundary conditions for radial electron waves and photon interactions due to
nuclear oscillations. Spectral emissions of excited atoms can be referred to a
decay of the state of motion of the coupled electron-proton system. The
framework developed is essentially deterministic, microphysical processes
analyzed are referred to material characteristics of particles involved.
Statistical effects are referred to interactions with the atomic environment,
the results derived are compatible with the second and third principle of
thermodynamics.

the equation of motion for the photon number in a laser are solved in steady
state as a function of the pump rate. Two level atom and two modes of three
levels atom are investigated. Close to threshold the usual linear dependence of
the intensity on the pump rate in found for all cases. However, far above
threshold strongly nonlinear dependence is encountered. In the cases for which
the pump connects the lower lasing state to one of the excited states the
character of the non-linearity differs crucially from the cases when the pump
in not related directly to the lower lasing state. Non-monotonic dependence of
laser intensity upon the pump rate is predicted. Detailed discussion of the
nonlinear behavior is presented, including saturation and depletion effects.
