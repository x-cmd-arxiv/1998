  Heidelberg",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Self-consistent simulations of the dynamical evolution of low-mass satellite
galaxies without dark matter on different orbits interacting with an extended
Galactic dark halo are described. The calculations proceed for many orbital
periods until well after the satellite dissolves. In all cases the dynamical
evolution converges to a remnant that contains roughly 1% of the initial
satellite mass. The stable remnant results from severe tidal shaping of the
initial satellite. To an observer from Earth these remnants look strikingly
similar to the Galactic dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. Their apparent
mass-to-light ratios are very large despite the fact that they contain no dark
matter.
  These computations show that a remnant without dark matter displays larger
line-of-sight velocity dispersions for more eccentric orbits, which is a result
of projection onto the observational plane. Assuming they are not dark matter
dominated, it follows that the Galactic dSph satellites with sigma>6km/s should
have orbital eccentricities of e>0.5. Some remnants have sub-structure along
the line-of-sight that may be apparent in the morphology of the horizontal
branch.

structure of dark matter halos formed in hierarchically clustering universes.
Regardless of halo mass, cosmological parameters, and power spectrum of initial
density fluctuations, the spherically averaged density profiles of dark matter
halos have a universal shape. The logarithmic slope of this profile is
shallower than isothermal near the center, and steepens gently outwards,
becoming steeper than isothermal near the halo virial radius. This profile can
be well approximated by a simple formula with only two free parameters: halo
mass and ``characteristic'' density, e.g., the density at the radius where the
logarithmic slope equals the isothermal value. This characteristic density is
proportional to the mean density of the universe at the time of collapse of
each system, and decreases systematically with increasing halo mass, reflecting
the later collapse of more massive halos. I use these results to examine what
constraints can be derived for Cold Dark Matter models from the rotation curves
of disk galaxies.

modes with precession frequencies lower than a certain critical frequency
\omega_{crit}, which is ~ 1 Hz for a compact object of solar mass. A radiation
warping torque can cause a few of the lowest-frequency LFGM modes to grow with
time, but even a strong radiation warping torque has essentially no effect on
the LFGM modes with frequencies > 10^{-4} Hz.

slightly less than the gravitomagnetic precession frequency $\omega_{gm,i}$ of
a particle at the inner edge of the disk, which is 30 Hz if the disk extends
inward to the innermost stable circular orbit around a compact object of 2
solar masses with dimensionless angular momentum cJ/GM^2 = 0.2. The
highest-frequency HFGM modes are very localized spiral corrugations of the
inner disk and are weakly damped, with Q values 2-50.

an overestimation of the exact energy, E, and at the same time, to an
underestimation of -TS, so the free energy F=E-TS is more accurate than either
of its parts. This insight explains a problem with ""hybrid methods"" using MC
correlation functions in the CVM entropy expression: They give exact energies E
and do not give significantly improved -TS relative to CVM, so they do not
benefit from the above noted cancellation of errors. Additionally, ""hybrid
methods"" suffer from the difficulty of adequately accounting for both ordered
and disordered phases in a consistent way. A different technique, the ""Entropic
Monte Carlo"" (EMC), is shown here to provide a means for critically evaluating
the CVM entropy. Inspired by EMC results, we find a universal and simple
correction to the CVM entropy which produces individual components of the free

very strong limits on R-parity violating couplings. Vice-versa, if R-parity
violation is established experimentally, before a detailed knowledge of the
spectrum is obtained, it will be very difficult to distinguish gravity mediated
from low energy gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking. Those conclusions are
very model independent. We also comment on the possibility of mixing between

determines the scale of the Weak interactions is closer to the scale of QCD
than to the Grand Unification or Planck scales. We discuss a novel approach to
this problem which is possible in theories in which different regions of the
universe can have different values of the physical parameters. In such a
situation, we would naturally find ourselves in a region which has parameters
favorable for life. We explore the whole range of values of the mass parameter
in the Higgs potential, $\mu^2$, from $+M_P^2$ to $-M_P^2$ and find that there
is only a narrow window, overlapping with the observed value, in which life is
likely to be possible. The observed value of $\mu^2$ is fairly typical of the
values in this range. Thus multiple domain theories in which $\mu^2$ varies
among domains may give a promising approach to solving the fine tunign problem
and explaining the closeness of the QCD scale and the Weak scale.

annihilation. Our results are presented in terms of the $E_q$-dependence of the
$t\bar tg$ cross section and the dependence on the cosine of the opening angle
$\theta_{12}$ between top and antitop for a center of mass energy of
$\sqrt{q^2}=500 GeV$. We then go on to determine mean values for the top
quark's energy as well as its longitudinal and transverse projections, and for
the deviation of $\sin\theta_{12}$ and $\cos\theta_{12}$ from the
anticollinearity limits $\sin\theta_{12}=0$ and $\cos\theta_{12}=-1$. For a
center of mass energy of $500 GeV$ we obtain $<E_q>=248.22 GeV$, $<E_L>=247.24
GeV$ and $<E_T>=4.70 GeV$. Thus, at this energy gluon radiation causes a total
average energy loss of 0.71% of the top quark's energy. The average energy loss
in the longitudinal direction is 1.06% and the average energy gain in the
transverse direction is 1.88%. These percentage figures go up to 3.77%, 5.19%
and 6.06%, respectively, at $1000\GeV$. For the mean of the acollinearity angle
$\bar\theta_{12}=180^0-\theta_{12}$ we obtain $<\bar\theta_{12}>=1.25^0$ at
$500 GeV$, the value of which goes up to $4.62^0$ at $1000 GeV$. From an
analysis of the transverse momentum of the top we find that the mean transverse
momentum of the top stays close to the mean total momentum of the gluon in the
energy range from threshold to $1000 GeV$ showing that the gluon momentum has a
large mean transverse component in this energy range.

picture of heavy quark fragmentation. When supplemented by an ad hoc factor of
(1-z), to suppress fragmentation near z=1, it supplies an excellent fit to the
data. We extend Bowler's model by accounting for the further decay of the
massive mesonic states produced by the initial string breaking. We find that
each subsequent string break and cascade decay beyond the first, introduces a
factor of (1-z). Furthermore we find that including a finite mass for the
quarks, which pop out of the vacuum and split the string, forces the first
string breaking to produce massive states requiring further decay. This
sequence terminates at the second stage of fragmentation where only relatively
""light"" heavy meson systems are formed. Thus we naturally account for the
phenomenologically required factor of (1-z). We also predict that the ratio of
(primary) fragments-vector/(vector plus scalar) should be .61. Our second stage
string fragmentation model provides an appealing picture of heavy quark
fragmentation.
