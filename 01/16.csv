have almost all been discovered by looking at the bright 3C sample of radio
sources. This has the disadvantage that the strong correlation between radio
luminosity and redshift within a single sample makes it impossible to be
determine whether these differences are the result of cosmic evolution or
whether they are simply the result of source properties depending on radio
luminosity. The solution to this problem is to compare the properties of
sources in faint samples with those of the 3C sources. I and collaborators have
recently removed the degeneracy between redshift and radio luminosity by
comparing the 3C sample to the recently completed 6C and 7C samples. In this
paper I concentrate on what our study has revealed about the host galaxies of
radio sources. At low redshift, radio galaxies are giant ellipticals with
absolute magnitude being independent of radio luminosity over a range of $\rm
10^4$ in radio luminosity. At $z \sim 1$, the radio-luminous 3C radio galaxies
are still giant ellipticals, but the 6C galaxies, only a factor of six lower in
radio luminosity, are fainter by about 1 mag in the near-IR and have much more
compact near-IR structures. At $z \sim 1$, radio galaxies follow a line in a
diagram of optical luminosity verses de Vaucouleurs scale length parallel to
the projection of the fundamental plane for nearby ellipticals in this diagram.
I discuss the significance of these results for our understanding of radio
galaxies.

type star known with a white dwarf companion was Sirius (A1V). Since the white
dwarf must have evolved from a main sequence progenitor with a mass greater
than that of a B5V star ($\geq$6.0M$_\odot$), this places a lower limit on the
maximum mass for white dwarf progenitors, with important implications for our
knowledge of the initial-final mass relation. Assuming a pure-hydrogen
atmospheric composition, we constrain the temperature of the white dwarf to be
between 39,000K and 49,000K. We also argue that this degenerate star is likely
to have mass significantly greater than the mean mass for white dwarf stars
($\approx$0.55M$_\odot$). Finally, we suggest that other bright B stars (e.g.\
$\theta$ Hya) detected in the extreme ultraviolet surveys of the ROSAT Wide

processes that were important in the origin and early evolution of galaxies and
in the heating and chemical enrichment of the inter-galactic medium. They may
also play an important role in the AGN phenomenon. In this contribution I
review the use of UV spectroscopic diagnostics that can be `calibrated' at
low-redshift and then applied at high redshift. From the analysis of the UV
properties of local starbursts we have learned: 1) dust dramatically affects
our view of high-mass star-formation 2) more metal-rich starbursts are redder
and more heavily extincted in the UV, more luminous, have stronger vacuum- UV
absorption-lines, and occur in more massive and optically-brighter host
galaxies 3) the strong interstellar absorption-lines directly reflect the
hydrodynamical consequences of the starburst. These results suggest that the
high-redshift `Lyman Drop-Out' galaxies are are typically highly extincted by
dust (average factor of 5 to 10), may have moderately high metallicities (0.1
to 1 times solar?), are probably building galaxies with stellar
surface-mass-densities similar to present-day ellipticals, and may be suffering
substantial losses of metal-enriched gas that can `pollute' the inter-galactic
medium. I also discuss UV observations of the nuclei of type 2 Seyfert
galaxies. These show that compact (100-pc-scale) heavily-reddened starbursts
are the source of most of the `featureless continuum' in UV-bright Seyfert 2
nuclei, and are an energetically significant component in these objects.

absolute mass of a galaxy cluster; Abell 1689. The absolute mass of a galaxy
cluster can be measured by the gravitational lens magnification of a background
galaxy population by the cluster potential. The lensing signal is complicated
by the variation in number counts due to galaxy clustering and shot-noise, and
by additional uncertainties in relating magnification to mass in the strong
lensing regime. Clustering and shot-noise can be dealt with using maximum
likelihood methods. Local approximations can then be used to estimate the mass
from magnification. Alternatively if the lens is axially symmetric we show that
the amplification equation can be solved nonlocally for the surface mass
density and the tangential shear. In this paper we present the first maps of
the total mass distribution in Abell 1689, measured from the deficit of lensed
red galaxies behind the cluster. Although noisier, these reproduce the main
features of mass maps made using the shear distortion of background galaxies
but have the correct normalisation, finally breaking the ``sheet-mass''
degeneracy that has plagued lensing methods based on shear. We derive the
cluster mass profile in the inner 4' (0.48 Mpc/h). These show a profile with a
near isothermal surface mass density \kappa = (0.5+/-0.1)(\theta/1')^{-1} out
to a radius of 2.4' (0.28Mpc/h), followed by a sudden drop into noise. We find
that the projected mass interior to 0.24 h^{-1}$Mpc is M(<0.24 Mpc/h)=(0.50+/-
0.09) \times 10^{15} Msol/h. We compare our results with masses estimated from

  Analysis (Orsay, 13-15 November 1997)",,,,"astro-ph gr-qc",,"  Both observational and theoretical rates of binary neutron star coalescence
give low prospects for detection of a single event by the initial LIGO/VIRGO

on the expected signal, a positive detection can be achieved. This relies on
the hypothesis that $\gamma$-ray bursts are the electromagnetic signature of
neutron star coalescences. The information about the direction of the source
can then be used to add in phase the signals from different detectors in order
(i) to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and (ii) to make the noise more
Gaussian. Besides, the information about the time of arrival can be used to
drastically decrease the observation time and thereby the false alarm rate.
Moreover the fluence of the $\gamma$-ray emission gives some information about
the amplitude of the gravitational signal. One can then add the signals from
$\sim 10^4$ observation boxes ($\sim$ number of $\gamma$-ray bursts during 10
years) to yield a positive detection. Such a detection, based on the Maximum a
Posteriori Probability Criterium, is a minimal one, in the sense that no
information on the position and time of the events, nor on any parameter of the
model, is collected. The advantage is that this detection requires an
improvement of the detector sensitivity by a factor of only $\sim 1.5$ with
respect to the initial LIGO/VIRGO interferometers, and that, if positive, it
will confirm the $\gamma$-ray burst model.

flux from the above-condensate cloud to the condensate and by 3-body
recombination of Bose-condensed atoms. The collapse, starting once the number
of Bose-condensed atoms reaches the critical value, ceases and turns to
expansion when the density of the collapsing cloud becomes so high that the
recombination losses dominate over attractive interparticle interaction. As a
result, we obtain a sequence of collapses, each of them followed by dynamic
oscillations of the condensate. In every collapse the 3-body recombination
burns only a part of the condensate, and the number of Bose-condensed atoms
always remains finite. However, it can comparatively slowly decrease after the
collapse, due to the transfer of the condensate particles to the
above-condensate cloud in the course of damping of the condensate oscillations.

B 59, 9527 (1999).","10.1103/PhysRevB.59.9527",,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  We develop a theory of superconductivity in ultrasmall (nm-scale) metallic
grains having a discrete electronic eigenspectrum with a mean level spacing of
order of the bulk gap. The theory is based on calculating the eigenspectrum
using a generalized BCS variational approach, whose applicability has been
extensively demonstrated in studies of pairing correlations in nuclear physics.
We discuss how conventional mean field theory breaks down with decreasing
sample size, how the so-called blocking effect weakens pairing correlations in
states with non-zero total spin, and how this affects the discrete
eigenspectrum's behavior in a magnetic field, which favors non-zero total spin.
In ultrasmall grains, spin magnetism dominates orbital magnetism, just as in
thin films in a parallel field; but whereas in the latter the magnetic-field
induced transition to a normal state is known to be first-order, we show that
in ultrasmall grains it is softened by finite size effects. Our calculations
qualitatively reproduce the magnetic-field dependent tunneling spectra for
individual aluminum grains measured recently by Ralph, Black and Tinkham. We
argue that previously-discussed parity effects for the odd-even ground state
energy difference are presently not observable for experimental reasons, and
propose an analogous parity effect for the pair-breaking energy that should be
observable provided that the grain size can be controlled sufficiently well.
Finally, experimental evidence is pointed out that the dominant role played by
time-reversed pairs of states, well-established in bulk and in dirty
superconductors, persists also in ultrasmall grains.

Analysis of the steeply declining monopole loop distribution function indicates
that for cutoffs $c > 0.5$, large monopole loops which are any finite fraction

(doubly-periodic branching solution). Influence of the symmetry breaking on
stability of branching solutions is investigated as a function of detuning. The
invariant torus is found to be stable under the detuning exceeds its critical
value, so that dynamically broken symmetry results in the apprearance of
low-frequency Goldstone-type mode. If the detuning then goes downward and
pumping is kept above the threshold, numerical analysis reveals that after a
cascade of period-doublings the strange Lorenz attractor is formed at small
values of detuning. It is found that there are three types of the system
behavior as pumping increases depending on the detuning. Quantum counterpart of

different and apparently unrelated facets of field theories can be thereby tied
together and understood in an essentially new way.
