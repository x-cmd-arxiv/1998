modelling of food web structure with the evolutionary modelling of speciation
and extinction events. The model describes dynamics of ecological communities
on an evolutionary timescale. Species are defined as sets of characteristic
features, and these features are used to determine interaction scores between
species. A simple rule is used to transfer resources from the external
environment through the food web to each of the species, and to determine mean
population sizes. A time step in the model represents a speciation event. A new
species is added with features similar to those of one of the existing species
and a new food web structure is then calculated. The new species may (i) add
stably to the web, (ii) become extinct immediately because it is poorly
adapted, or (iii) cause one or more other species to become extinct due to
competition for resources. We measure various properties of the model webs and
compare these with data on real food webs. These properties include the
proportions of basal, intermediate and top species, the number of links per
species and the number of trophic levels. We also study the evolutionary
dynamics of the model ecosystem by following the fluctuations in the total
number of species in the web. Extinction avalanches occur when novel organisms
arise which are significantly better adapted than existing ones. We discuss
these results in relation to the observed extinction events in the fossil
record, and to the theory of self-organized criticality.

observations of the central parts of D478, a large (> 200 pc) dark dust cloud
located in a quiescent region of the inner disk of M31 where single-dish
CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations were previously obtained. Only a small
fraction (< 15%) of the CO(1-0) flux previously detected in this region with
the single-dish telescope is recorded by the interferometer. Most of the
CO(1-0) emission must therefore have the appearance of a smooth surface with
very little structure on scales smaller than approx 25'' (85 pc). Together with
the earlier CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) single-dish results the new CO(3-2) data are in
good agreement with LTE predictions for optically thick lines at Tex = Tkin =
3.5K. These results rule out the conventional model for these clouds consisting
of warm clumps with a low filling factor (as would be the case if they
resembled Galactic GMCs) and confirm that large, massive, cold molecular clouds
exist in the inner disk of M31 with kinetic temperatures close to that of the
cosmic microwave background. Such extremely low temperatures are likely to be a
consequence of the low heating rate in these particular regions of M31, where
very little massive star formation is occurring at present.
  From the CO line profile widths we estimate the Virial mass surface density
of D478 to be 80 -- 177 Msun pc-2. This is a factor 7 -- 16 times larger than
the value obtained by multiplying the CO(1-0) profile integrals with the
conventional ``X-factor''.

to an expansion in terms of orthogonal (Hermite) functions. To obtain an
accurate comparison, we model the emergent line profiles from rotating and
pulsating stars, taking the instrumental point spread function into account. We
describe this modeling process in detail.
  We find no evidence for line profile or strength variations at the radial
velocity period in either 51 Peg or in Tau Boo. For 51 Peg, our upper limit for
line shape variations with 4.23-day periodicity is small enough to exclude with
10 sigma confidence the bisector curvature signal reported by Gray & Hatzes;
the bisector span and relative line depth signals reported by Gray (1997) are
also not seen, but in this case with marginal (2 sigma) confidence. We cannot,
however, exclude pulsations as the source of 51 Peg's radial velocity
variation, because our models imply that line shape variations associated with
pulsations should be much smaller than those computed by Gray & Hatzes; these
smaller signals are below the detection limits both for Gray & Hatzes' data and
for our own.
  Tau Boo's large radial velocity amplitude and v*sin(i) make it easier to test
for pulsations in this star. Again we find no evidence for periodic line-shape
changes, at a level that rules out pulsations as the source of the radial
velocity variability. We conclude that the planet hypothesis remains the most
likely explanation for the existing data.

were conducted using the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph on board the
Hubble Space Telescope. A very detailed abundance analysis via spectral
synthesis has been carried out for these two stars, as well as for two other
metal-poor objects with published spectra, using both Kurucz and OSMARCS model
photospheres, and taking into account consistently the NLTE effects on the line
formation. We have also re-assessed all published boron abundances of old disk
and halo unevolved stars. Our analysis shows that the combination of high
effective temperature (Teff > 6000 K, for which boron is mainly ionized) and
low metallicity ([Fe/H]<-1) makes it difficult to obtain accurate estimates of
boron abundances from the B I 2497 A line. This is the case of HD 84937 and
three other published objects (including two stars with [Fe/H] ~ -3), for which
only upper limits can be established. BD +23 3130, with [Fe/H] ~ -2.9 and
logN(B)_NLTE=0.05+/-0.30, appears then as the most metal-poor star for which a
firm measurement of the boron abundance presently exists. The evolution of the
boron abundance with metallicity that emerges from the seven remaining stars
with Teff < 6000 K and [Fe/H]<-1, for which beryllium abundances were derived
using the same stellar parameters, shows a linear increase with a slope ~ 1.
Furthermore, the B/Be ratio found is constant at a value ~ 20 for stars in the
range -3<[Fe/H]<-1. These results point to spallation reactions of ambient
protons and alpha particles with energetic particles enriched in CNO as the
origin of boron and beryllium in halo stars.

data from several X-ray observatories. We confirm the ~60-day cyclic variation
of the X-ray flux in the long-term monitoring data from the RXTE and CGRO
observatories. X-ray light curves and spectra from the ROSAT, Ginga, and ASCA
observatories show that the uneclipsed flux varies by as much as a factor of
twenty between a high-flux state when 0.71 second pulses are present and a
low-flux state when pulses are absent. In contrast, during eclipses when the
X-rays consist of radiation scattered from circumsource matter, the fluxes and
spectra in the high and low states are approximately the same. These
observations prove that the low state of SMC X-1 is not caused by a reduction
in the intrinsic luminosity of the source, or a spectral redistribution
thereof, but rather by a quasi-periodic blockage of the line of sight, most
likely by a precessing tilted accretion disk. In each of two observations in
the midst of low states a brief increase in the X-ray flux and reappearance of
0.71 second pulses occurred near orbital phase 0.2. These brief increases
result from an opening of the line of sight to the pulsar that may be caused by
wobble in the precessing accretion disk. The records of spin up of the neutron
star and decay of the binary orbit are extended during 1991-1996 by
pulse-timing analysis of ROSAT, ASCA, and RXTE PCA data. The pulse profiles in
various energy ranges from 0.1 to >21 keV are well represented as a combination
of a pencil beam and a fan beam. Finally, there is a marked difference between
the power spectra of random fluctuations in the high-state data from the RXTE

consequence, a rational velocity of the travelling interface is subject to
mode-locking with respect to the system parameters. We analytically compute the
Arnold's tongues where particular spatio-temporal periodic orbits exist. The
boundaries of the mode-locked regions correspond to border-collision
bifurcations of the toral map. By varying the system parameters it is possible
to increase the number of interfacial sites corresponding to a border-collision

one-particle and correlation data that the freeze-out temperature is less than
100 MeV and that both the longitudinal and transverse collective
velocities--which are anti-correlated with the temperature--are substantial. We
also discuss the flaws in several previous analyses that yielded a much higher
freeze-out temperature of approximately 140 MeV for both this reaction and
other reactions involving heavier projectiles and/or higher bombarding
energies.

of the radiation field to the center of mass motion gives rise to an effective
scalar type coupling. This induced scalar photon interaction emerges as a
correction in competition with the usual multipole interactions. This effect is
particularly important in positronium where the electric quadrupole interaction
is totally suppressed. We illustrate this effect with the two-photon decay of
metastable hydrogenic systems.
