optimize the reconstruction method, with respect to the kernel used in the

internal shocks in a relativistic wind with a highly non uniform distribution
of the Lorentz factor. We follow the evolution of the wind using a very
simplified approach where a large number of layers interact by direct
collisions but where all pressure waves have been suppressed. We suppose that
the magnetic field and the electron Lorentz factor reach large equipartition
values in the shocks. Synchrotron photons emitted by the relativistic electrons
have a typical energy in the gamma-ray range in the observer frame. Synthetic
bursts are constructed as the sum of the contributions from all the internal
elementary shocks and their temporal and spectral properties are compared to
the observations. We reproduce the diversity of burst profiles, the ``FRED''
shape of individual pulses and the short time scale variability. Synthetic
bursts also satisfy the duration-hardness relation and individual pulses are
found to be narrower at high energy, in agreement with the observations. These
results suggest that internal shocks in a relativistic wind may indeed be at
the origin of gamma-ray bursts. A potential problem is however the relatively
low efficiency of the dissipation process. If the relativistic wind is powered
by accretion from a disc to a stellar mass black hole it implies that a
substantial fraction of the available energy is injected into the wind.

\bar{\nu}$. In a certain class of new physics models, the extra contributions
to FCNC processes can be parametrized by its ratio to the standard model (SM)
contribution with the common CKM factors. The ratio $R_1$ has been used in the
analysis of $\xd$ and $\epsilon_K$ parameters. In the above class of models,
the $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ decay amplitude can be parametrized by the
ratio $R_2$. Then the experimentally allowed region for new physics
contributions can be given in terms of $R_1,R_2$ and the CP violating phase
$\delta$ of the CKM matrix. Constraints on $R_1$ and $\cosd$ are obtained by
taking account of current experimental data and theoretical uncertainties on
$\bbbar$ and $\kkbar$ mixings. We study impacts of future improved measurements
by using $(R_1, R_2, \cosd)$ basis. We discuss contributions in the minimal
supersymmetric SM and the two Higgs doublet model as examples.

squarks contributions to Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC). Recently it
was noted that in some free fermionic three generation models the anomalous
U(1) is family universal. It was further shown that if the $D$--term of the
$U(1)_A$ is the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking, the squark masses
are indeed approximately degenerate. In this paper I discuss the properties of
the superstring models that give rise to the flavor universal anomalous U(1).
The root cause for the universal $U(1)_A$ is the cyclic permutation symmetry,
the characteristic property of the $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold compactification,
realized in the free fermionic models by the NAHE set of boundary condition
basis vectors. The properties of the three generation models that preserve this
cyclic permutation symmetry in the flavor charges are discussed. The cyclic
permutation symmetry of the $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifold compactification is
proposed to be the characteristic property, of phenomenological interest, that
distinguishes it from other classes of superstring compactifications.

characterized with the help of the generating function, which we derive using
the exact statistical description of raw experimental outcomes. We use the
developed formalism to point out that the statistical uncertainty results in
substantial limitations of the determined information on the quantum state:
though a family of observables characterizing the quantum state can be safely
evaluated from experimental data, its further use to obtain the expectation
value of some operators generates exploding statistical errors. These issues
are discussed using the example of phase-insensitive measurements of a single
light mode. We study reconstruction of the photon number distribution from
photon counting and random phase homodyne detection. We show that utilization
of the reconstructed distribution to evaluate a simple well-behaved observable,
namely the parity operator, encounters difficulties due to accumulation of
statistical errors. As the parity operator yields the Wigner function at the
phase space origin, this example also demonstrates that transformation between
various experimentally determined representations of the quantum state is a
quite delicate matter.
