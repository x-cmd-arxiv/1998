program to investigate the sub-parsec structure of quasars and AGN and to study
the changes in their structure with time. Many of the sources included in our
study, particularly those located south of +35 degrees, have not been
previously imaged with milliarcsecond resolution. Each of the sources has been
observed at multiple epochs. In this paper we show images of each of the 132
sources which we have observed. For each source we present data at the epoch
which had the best quality data. The milliarcsecond jets generally appear
one-sided but two-sided structure is often found in lower luminosity radio
galaxies and in high luminosity quasars with gigahertz peaked spectra. Usually
the structure is unresolved along the direction perpendicular to the jet, but a
few sources have broad plumes. In some low luminosity radio galaxies, the
structure appears more symmetric at 2 cm than at long wavelengths. The apparent
long wavelength symmetry in these sources is probably due to absorption by
intervening material. A few sources contain only a single component with any
secondary feature at least a thousand times weaker. We find no obvious
correlation of radio morphology and the detection of gamma-ray emission by
EGRET.

brightness dwarf spiral. Three of the new dwarfs have strong emission lines and
appear to be blue compact dwarfs (BCDs), doubling the number of confirmed BCDs

1160 Hz to 1145 Hz when the count rate increased, which would be quite
different from what is observed in other atoll sources for which kHz QPOs have
been discovered. In the X-ray color-color diagram and hardness-intensity
diagram the source traced out the curved branch (the so-called banana branch)
which has been found by previous instruments. The kHz QPO was only detected
when the source was at the lowest count rates during our observations, i.e. on
the lower part of the banana branch. When 4U 1735-44 was at higher count rates,
i.e. on the upper part of the banana branch and at higher inferred mass
accretion rate with respect to that on the lower part of the banana branch, the
QPO was not detected.
  Besides the kHz QPO we discovered a low frequency QPO with a frequency near
67 Hz, together with a complex broad peaked noise component below 30 Hz. This
67 Hz QPO may be related to the magnetospheric beat-frequency QPO, which is
observed on the horizontal branch of Z sources. This idea is supported by the

location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for binary neutron stars
(BNSs) in several levels of post Newtonian (PN) approximations. We reach the
following conclusion at present: (1) even in the Newtonian case, there exists
the ISCO for binary of sufficiently stiff equation of state (EOS). If the mass
and the radius of each star are fixed, the angular velocity at the ISCO
$\Omega_{ISCO}$ is larger for softer EOS: (2) when we include the first PN
correction, there appear roughly two kinds of effects. One is the effect to the
self-gravity of each star of binary and the other is to the gravity acting
between two stars. Due to the former one, each star of binary becomes compact
and the tidal effect is less effective. As a result, $\Omega_{ISCO}$ tends to
be increased. On the other hand, the latter one has the property to destabilize
the binary orbit, and $\Omega_{ISCO}$ tends to be decreased. If we take into
account both effects, however, the former effect is stronger than the latter
one, and $\Omega_{ISCO}$ becomes large with increase of the 1PN correction: (3)
the feature mentioned above is more remarkable for softer EOS if the mass and
radius are fixed. This is because for softer EOS, each star has the larger
central density and is susceptible to the GR correction: (4) there has been no
self consistent calculation including all the 2PN effects and only exist
studies in which one merely includes the effect of the 2PN gravity acting
between two stars. In this case, the effect has the property to destabilize the
binary orbit, so that $\Omega_{ISCO}$ is always smaller than that for the
Newtonian case. If we include the PN effect of the self-gravity to each star,
$\Omega_{ISCO}$ will increase.

bound pionic atoms with one neutron hole being left. We develop a theoretical
model to calculate cross sections of deeply bound pionic atoms and
quasi-elastic pion production. The results are compared with data which have
been obtained so far. We show that the theoretical model describes the data of
both reactions well.

interpretation of quantum theory, this appearance is an illusion; the correct
view is the ""view from outside"" in which even macroscopic objects are in
general in a superposition of different positions. In the Bohm model, objects
really are in definite positions. This additional aspect of reality is
accessible only from the ""inside""; thus in the Bohm model the view from inside
can be more correct than is the view from outside.
