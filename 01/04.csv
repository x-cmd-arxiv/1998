direct determination of these quantities. For this reason theoretical and
observational progress has been restricted in calculating one point
distribution functions and related moments. Methods based on factorial moments
of two point count probability distribution (cumulant correlators) were
recently shown to be efficient in subtracting discreteness effects and
extracting useful information from galaxy catalogs. We use these cumulant
correlators $Q_{NM}$ to study clustering in scale free simulations both in two
and three dimensions. Using this method in the highly nonlinear regime we were
able to separate hierarchal amplitudes $Q_3, R_a and R_b$ associated with
different tree graphs contributing to third and fourth order correlation
functions. They were found to increase with power on large scales. Results
based on factorial moments of one point cumulants show very good agreement with
that on cumulant correlators. Comparison of simulation results with
perturbation theory and extended perturbation theory were found to be in
reasonable agreement. Comparisons were also made against predictions from
hierarchal models for higher order correlations. We argue that finite volume
corrections are very important for computation of cumulant correlators.

region (BLR) of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. For this purpose we apply cross
correlation (CC) analysis to a high resolution KECK spectrum of the galaxy. No
such signature is found in the data. In order for cloud models to be compatible
with this result, there must be at least $\sim3\times10^7$ emitting clouds in
the BLR, where the limit is based on simulation of a homogeneous cloud
population. More realistic distributions increase the lower limit to above
$10^8$. These numbers are an order of magnitude improvement on our previous
limit from Mrk 335, where the improvement comes from higher S/N, broader lines,
and refined simulations. Combined with the predicted upper limit for the number
of emitting clouds in NGC 4151 ($10^6-10^7$), the derived lower limit puts a
strong constraint on the cloud scenario in the BLR of this object. Similar
constraints can be paled on models where the emission originates in streams and
sheets. Thus, this investigation suggests that the BELs in NGC 4151, and by
extension in all AGNs, are not made of an ensemble of discrete independent
emitters.

the Newtonian gravitational analogue the distant cutoff problem is solved by
including the self-gravity of the medium. Then the Jeans length appears
naturally as a cutoff. Despite the different sign of the coupling constant from
the case of the electric plasma, the same sort of theory works in both cases
and removes the need of introducing ad hoc cutoffs from both of them.

contact potential can be used to identify the native fold of a protein. Ideally
one would hope that a universal energy function exists, for which the native
folds of all proteins are the respective ground states. Here we pose a much
more restricted question: is it possible to find a set of contact parameters
for which the energy of the native contact map of a single protein (crambin) is
lower than that of all possible physically realizable decoy maps. We seek such
a set of parameters by perceptron learning, a procedure which is guaranteed to
find such a set if it exists. We found that it is extremely hard (and most
probably, impossible) to fine tune contact parameters that will assign all
alternative conformations higher energy than that of the native map. This
finding clearly indicates that it is impossible to derive a general pairwise
contact potential that can be used to fold any given protein. Inclusion of
additional energy terms, such as hydrophobic (solvation), hydrogen bond or
multi-body interactions may help to attain foldability within specific
structural families.

quantum deformation of the moduli space are explained, with emphasis on the
importance of identifying the relevant degrees of freedom in the ground state.
Supersymmetry breaking and the behavior of the Witten index in non-chiral
theories are discussed. The quantum removal of directions which are classically
unlifted is also illustrated. Examples of product gauge group theories that
admit dual descriptions of the non-supersymmetric ground state are also

ontological view of quantum theory faces difficulties when spacelike
measurements on entangled states have to be described, because time ordering of
spacelike events can change under Lorentz-Poincar\'e transformations. In the
present paper it is shown that a necessary condition for consistency is to
require state vector reduction on the backward light-cone. A fresh approach to
the quantum measurement problem appears feasible within such a framework.
