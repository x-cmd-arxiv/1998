neighbourhood of cosmic string wakes which are formed at high redshift
($z\simeq 2240$) for a ``realistic'' scenario of wake formation. These wakes
are the ones which stand out most prominently as cosmological sheets and are
expected to play a dominant r\^ole in the cosmic string model of structure
formation. Employing a high-resolution 3-D hydrodynamics code to evolve these
wakes until the present day yields results for the baryon bias generated in the
inner wake region. I find that today, wakes would be $1.5 h^{-1}$ Mpc thick and
contain a 70% excess in the density of baryons over the dark matter density in
their centre. However, high density peaks in the wake region do not inherit a
baryon enhancement. I propose a mechanism for this erasure of the baryon excess
in spherically collapsed objects based on the geometry change around the
collapsing region. Further, I present heuristic arguments for the consequences
of this work for large scale structure in the cosmic string model and conclude
that the peculiarities of wake formation are unlikely to have significant
import on the discrepancy between power spectrum predictions and observations
in this model. If one invokes the nucleosynthesis bound on $\Omega_b$ this
could be seen as strengthening the case against $\Omega_m=1$ or for low Hubble
constants.

supernova remnant made with the CANGAROO 3.8 m Telescope. TeV gamma rays were
detected at the sky position and extension coincident with the north-east (NE)
rim of shell-type Supernova remnant (SNR) SN1006 (Type Ia). SN1006 has been a
most likely candidate for an extended TeV Gamma-ray source, since the clear
synchrotron X-ray emission from the rims was recently observed by ASCA (Koyama
et al. 1995), which is a strong evidence of the existence of very high energy
electrons up to hundreds of TeV in the SNR. The observed TeV gamma-ray flux was
$(2.4\pm 0.5(statistical) \pm 0.7(systematic)) \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ ($\ge 3.0\pm 0.9$ TeV) and $ (4.6\pm 0.6 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-12}$
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ ($\ge 1.7\pm 0.5$ TeV) from the 1996 and 1997 observations,
respectively. Also we set an upper limit on the TeV gamma-ray emission from the
SW rim, estimated to be $ 1.1 \times 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ ($\ge 1.7\pm
0.5$ TeV, 95% CL) in the 1997 data. The TeV gamma rays can be attributed to the
2.7 K cosmic background photons up-scattered by electrons of energies up to
about 10$^{14}$ eV by the inverse Compton (IC) process. The observed flux of
the TeV gamma rays, together with that of the non-thermal X-rays, gives firm
constraints on the acceleration process in the SNR shell; a magnetic field of
$6.5\pm2$ $\mu$G is inferred from both the synchrotron X-rays and inverse
Compton TeV gamma-rays, which gives entirely consistent mechanisms that
electrons of energies up to 10$^{14}$ eV are produced via the shock
acceleration in SN1006.

galaxies (BCGs) in the redshift range 0<z<1. In good agreement with earlier
studies, we confirm that the scatter in the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies
is small (0.3 magnitudes). The BCGs exhibit very little luminosity evolution in
this redshift range: if q_0=0.0 we detect no luminosity evolution; for q_0=0.5
we measure a small negative evolution (i.e., BCGs were about 0.5 magnitudes
fainter at z=1 than today). If the mass in stars of these galaxies had remained
constant over this period of time, substantial positive luminosity evolution
would be expected: BCGs should have been brighter in the past since their stars
were younger. A likely explanation for the observed zero or negative evolution
is that the stellar mass of the BCGs has been assembled over time through
merging and accretion, as expected in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.
The colour evolution of the BCGs is consistent with that of an old stellar
population (z_form >2) that is evolving passively. We can thus use evolutionary
population synthesis models to estimate the rate of growth in stellar mass for
these systems. We find that the stellar mass in a typical BCG has grown by a
factor ~ 2 since z=1 if q_0=0.0 or by factor ~ 4 if q_0=0.5. These results are
in good agreement with the predictions of semi-analytic models of galaxy
formation and evolution set in the context of a hierarchical scenario for
structure formation. The models predict a scatter in the luminosities of the
BCGs that is somewhat larger than the observed one, but that depends on the
criterion used to select the model clusters.

selected sample of spiral (Sa to Irr) galaxies belonging to the ""Great Wall""
complete up to mp=15.4, thus composed of galaxies brighter than Mp=-18.8
(H0=100 km Mpc^-1 s^-1). The frequency distribution of the H alpha E.W.,
determined for the first time from an optically complete sample, is
approximately gaussian peaking at E.W. ~25 A. We find that, at the present
limiting luminosity, the star formation properties of spiral+Irr galaxies
members of the Coma and A1367 clusters do not differ significantly from those
of the isolated ones belonging to the Great Wall. The present analysis confirms
the well known increase of the current massive star formation rate (SFR) with
Hubble type. Moreover perhaps a more fundamental anticorrelation exists between
the SFR and the mass of disk galaxies: low-mass spirals and dwarf systems have
present SFRs ~50 times higher than giant spirals. This result is consistent
with the idea that disk galaxies are coeval, evolve as ""closed systems"" with
exponentially declining SFR and that the mass of their progenitor protogalaxies
is the principal parameter governing their evolution. Massive systems having
high initial efficiency of collapse, or a short collapse time-scale, have
retained little gas to feed the present epoch of star formation. These findings
support the conclusions of Gavazzi & Scodeggio (1996) who studyed the

a close stellar or planetary companion. Dissipation arising from a turbulent
viscosity operating in the convection zone and radiative damping in the
radiative core are considered. We compute the torque exerted on the star by a
companion in circular orbit, and determine the potentially observable magnitude
of the tidally induced velocity at the stellar photosphere. These calculations
are compared with the results obtained by assuming that a very small frequency
limit can be taken in order to calculate the tidal response (equilibrium tide).
For a standard solar model, the latter is found to give a relatively poor
approximation at the periods of interest of several days, even when the system
is far from resonance with a normal mode. It is shown that although the
companion may go through a succession of resonances as it spirals in under the
action of the tides, for a fixed spectrum of normal modes its migration is
controlled essentially by the non-resonant interaction. We find that the
turbulent viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularization
rates of main sequence solar-type binaries is about fifty times larger than
that simply estimated from mixing length theory for non-rotating stars. We
discuss the means by which this enhanced viscosity might be realized. These
calculations are applied to 51 Pegasi. We show that the perturbed velocity
induced by the tides at the stellar surface is too small to be observed.

ripple formation in a certain region of parameter space. We focus in particular
on the (realistic) case where the migration velocity of the instability is much

while others pass through lensing-induced caustics. This combination of effects
increases observed areas corresponding to a given solid angle even when
averaged over large angular scales, through the additive effect of increases on
all scales, but particularly on micro-angular scales; however angular sizes
will not be significantly effected on large angular scales (when caustics
occur, area distances and angular-diameter distances no longer coincide). We
compare our results with other works on lensing, which claim there is no such
effect, and explain why the effect will indeed occur in the (realistic)
situation where caustics due to lensing are significant. Whether or not the
effect is significant for number counts depends on the associated angular
scales and on the distribution of inhomogeneities in the universe. It could
also possibly affect the spectrum of CBR anisotropies on small angular scales,
indeed caustics can induce a non-Gaussian signature into the CMB at small
scales and lead to stronger mixing of anisotropies than occurs in weak lensing.

scaling, the model suggests a close connection between the neutral curve and
the dispersion relation of the waves, which agrees quite well with experiments.
For strong hysteresis we find localized oscillon solutions.

  Report",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.57.4057",,"quant-ph",,"  The method of phenomenological damping developed by Pitaevskii for
superfluidity near the $\lambda$ point is simulated numerically for the case of
a dilute, alkali, inhomogeneous Bose-condensed gas near absolute zero. We study
several features of this method in describing the damping of excitations in a
Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition, we show that the method may be employed
to obtain numerically accurate ground states for a variety of trap potentials.

Ansatz (MPA), which was originally developed in the studies on the asymmetric
simple exclusion process and the quantum antiferromagnetic spin chain. The MPA
tells that the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian is constructed by the
Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra (ZF-algebra) and the boundary states. We adopt
the type I vertex operator of $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ as the ZF-algebra and realize
the boundary states in the bosonic $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ form. The correlation
functions are given by the product of the vertex operators and the bosonic
boundary states. We express them in the integration forms.
