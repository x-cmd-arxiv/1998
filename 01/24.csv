galaxy M100, a catalogue is composed listing 1948 individual HII regions. I
give details of the data collection and reduction procedure, and of the
production of the HII region catalogue. For each HII region, the catalogue
gives its position relative to the centre of the galaxy, its deprojected
distance to the centre, its radius, and its calibrated luminosity. I present
the results of a statistical study of properties of the HII regions. The
luminosity function of the complete ensemble of HII regions is well fitted by a
power-law slope in the higher luminosity range, confirming results for galaxies
like M100. Luminosity function slopes for arm and interarm HII regions
separately are equal within the errors of the fits, indicating that whereas the
density wave accumulates material into the arm regions, and may trigger star
formation there, it does not in fact change the mass distribution of the
star-forming clouds, nor the statistical properties of the HII region
population. Diameter and radial number density distributions are discussed. The
huge number of HII regions allowed the construction of a number of independent
luminosity functions at different distances to the nucleus. The slope of the
luminosity function shows a marginal decrease with increasing distance from the
centre, which could indicate a gradual change toward shallower IMF slopes with
increasing galactocentric distance, or an evolutionary effect.

population of intergalactic stars, ripped from galaxies during cluster
formation or when the galaxies' orbits take them through the cluster center.
Support for the existence of such a population of free-floating stars comes
from measurements of the diffuse light in clusters, and from recent detections
of planetary nebulae with positions and/or velocities far removed from any
observed cluster galaxy. But estimates for the mass of the diffuse population
and its distribution relative to the galaxies are still highly uncertain. Here
we report the direct detection of intergalactic stars in deep images of a blank
field in the Virgo Cluster. The data suggest that approximately 10% of the
stellar mass of the cluster is in intergalactic stars. We observe a relatively
homogeneous distribution of stars, with evidence of a slight gradient toward
M87.

  The motivation for stellar imaging via microlensing lies in its unique
ability to provide center-to-limb variation of spectral diagnostic lines. Such
variation maps into a variation with depth in the stellar atmosphere - a unique
and very valuable constraint for modeling the structure of red giants'
atmospheres. We illustrate the technique on a recent successful observational

and Bowen showed the existence of an invariant measure (SRB measure) weakly
attracting the temporal average of any initial distribution that is absolutely
continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Recently, the SRB measures
were found to be related to the nonequilibrium stationary state distribution
functions for thermostated or open systems. Inspite of the importance of these
SRB measures, it is difficult to handle them analytically because they are
often singular functions. In this article, for three kinds of Baker-type maps,
the SRB measures are analytically constructed with the aid of a functional
equation, which was proposed by de Rham in order to deal with a class of
singular functions. We first briefly review the properties of singular
functions including those of de Rham. Then, the Baker-type maps are described,
one of which is non-conservative but time reversible, the second has a
Cantor-like invariant set, and the third is a model of a simple chemical
reaction $R \leftrightarrow I \leftrightarrow P$. For the second example, the
cases with and without escape are considered. For the last example, we consider
the reaction processes in a closed system and in an open system under a flux
boundary condition. In all cases, we show that the evolution equation of the
distribution functions partially integrated over the unstable direction is very
similar to de Rham's functional equation and, employing this analogy, we
explicitly construct the SRB measures.

momentum relaxation times in the heavy residues formed in heavy-ion collisions
at intermediate energies. It is found that only at incident energies below the
Fermi energy, chemical or thermal equilibrium can be reached before dynamical
instability is developed in the heavy residues. Also, the isospin relaxation
time is shorter (longer) than that for momentum at beam energies lower (higher)
than the Fermi energy.

we give a quantitative description of the time variation of the effective atom
number while the cloud is exploding and falling. We discuss the two cases where
the effective number is defined from the linear and nonlinear phase shifts,
respectively. We also evaluate the fluctuations of the effective atom number by
calculating their correlation functions and the associated noise spectra.
Finally we estimate the effect of these fluctuations on experiments where the
probe beam passes through a cavity containing the atomic cloud.

atomic functions over the intensity profile. The results of the plane-wave and
Gaussian-wave theories are compared. When large squeezing is predicted we find
the prediction of the plane-wave model not to be reliable outside the Kerr
domain. We give an estimate of the squeezing degradation due to the Gaussian
transverse structure.

mode, the nonlinear coupling produces an excess noise in the fluctuations of
the output beam. Intensity squeezing seems to be particularly robust with
respect to mode coupling, while quadrature squeezing is more sensitive.
However, it is possible to find a mode the quadrature squeezing of which is not
affected by the coupling.
