survey including all experimental papers on fractals which appeared in the six
Physical Review journals (A-E and Letters) during the 1990's shows that
experimental reports of fractal behavior are typically based on a scaling range
$\Delta$ which spans only 0.5 - 2 decades. This range is limited by upper and
lower cutoffs either because further data is not accessible or due to crossover
bends. Focusing on spatial fractals, a classification is proposed into (a)
aggregation; (b) porous media; (c) surfaces and fronts; (d) fracture and (e)
critical phenomena. Most of these systems, [except for class (e)] involve
processes far from thermal equilibrium. The fact that for self similar fractals
[in contrast to the self affine fractals of class (c)] there are hardly any
exceptions to the finding of $\Delta \le 2$ decades, raises the possibility
that the cutoffs are due to intrinsic properties of the measured systems rather
than the specific experimental conditions and apparatus. To examine the origin
of the limited range we focus on a class of aggregation systems. In these
systems a molecular beam is deposited on a surface, giving rise to nucleation
and growth of diffusion-limited-aggregation-like clusters. Scaling arguments
are used to show that the required duration of the deposition experiment
increases exponentially with $\Delta$. Furthermore, using realistic parameters
for surfaces such as Al(111) it is shown that these considerations limit the
range of fractal behavior to less than two decades in agreement with the
experimental findings. It is conjectured that related kinetic mechanisms that
limit the scaling range are common in other nonequilibrium processes which
generate spatial fractals.

Using the effective potential, we find monopole dominance for chiral-symmetry

$M_{ch} \simeq 1.31$ GeV. The gluon condensate is calculated as

early phase of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions for the RHIC and LHC
energies is calculated by means of perturbative QCD. We calculate the single
photon cross section ($A+B\to \gamma +X$) by taking into account the partonic
sub processes $q+ \bar{q}\to \gamma +g$ and $q+g\to\gamma +q$ as well as the
Bremsstrahlung corrections to those processes. We choose a lower momentum
cut-off $k_0 =2$ GeV separating the soft physics from perturbative QCD. We
compare the results for those primary collision with the photons produced in
reactions of the thermalized secondary particles, which are calculated within
scaling hydrodynamics. The QCD processes are taken in leading order. Nuclear
shadowing corrections, which alter the involved nuclear structure functions are
explicitly taken into account and compared to unshadowed results. Employing the
GRV parton distribution parametrizations we find that at RHIC prompt
QCD-photons dominate over the thermal radiation down to transverse momenta $k_T
\approx 2$ GeV. At LHC, however, thermal radiation from the QGP dominates for
photon transverse momenta $k_T \leq 5$ GeV, if nuclear shadowing effects on
prompt photon production are taken into account.
