host galaxies in recent high resolution HST photometry of early type galaxies

of these very luminous quasars are likely to be early type galaxies and that b)
the mass ratio of central black holes (BHs) and their host spheroidal

Using the hierarchical galaxy evolution scheme for the formation of early-type
galaxies, we present here a general viscous accretion disk model to trace the
star formation and central engine evolution before and after mergers. In our
model, starbursts and AGN coexist; these two activities compete for the gas
supply, interact with each other, probably feed back on each other and lock
into a final status. They thus constrain the ratio of central black hole mass
and its host spheroidal mass to a universal value of order $10^{-3}$.

sample of eight interacting galaxy systems, each believed to involve a similar
encounter between two spiral discs of approximately equal size. The mergers
span a large range in age, from completely detached to fully merged systems. A
great deal of interesting X-ray structure is seen, and the X-ray properties of
each individual system are discussed in detail. Along the merging sequence,
several trends are evident: in the case of several of the infrared bright
systems, the diffuse emission is very extended, and appears to arise from
material ejected from the galaxies. The onset of this process seems to occur
very soon after the galaxies first encounter one another, and these ejections
soon evolve into distorted flows. More massive extensions (perhaps involving up
to 1e10 solar masses of hot gas) are seen at the `ultraluminous' peak of the
interaction, as the galactic nuclei coalesce. The amplitude of the evolution of
the X-ray emission through a merger is markedly different from that of the
infrared and radio emission however, and this, we believe, may well be linked
with the large extensions of hot gas observed. The late, relaxed remnants,
appear relatively devoid of gas, and possess an X-ray halo very different from
that of typical ellipticals, a problem for the `merger hypothesis', whereby the
merger of two disc galaxies results in an elliptical galaxy. However, these
systems are still relatively young in terms of total merger lifetime, and they
may still have a few Gyr of evolution to go through, before they resemble
typical elliptical galaxies.

first bound objects to form can be very small, much smaller than a solar mass.
After recombination, the Jeans mass drops rapidly to the order of a Giant
Molecular Cloud (GMC) mass ($\sim 10^5$ M$_\odot$), and the H$_2$ cooling can
make the collapse quasi-isothermal; this leads to recursive fragmentation, and
formation of clumps so dense that 3-body reactions transform the gas almost
entirely to the molecular phase. This could lead to star formation in some
places, but since star formation is very inefficient, most of the molecular gas
could consist of a fractal built on clumpuscules thermalized with the
background radiation, and filling a tiny fraction of the volume.
  The bulk of the gas mass can therefore be trapped in this phase, well before
the first stars re-heat and re-ionize the diffuse gaseous medium}. This results
in a very contrasted multi-phase baryonic medium, that has partly remained
until the present time.

are a natural consequence of the expansion of the companion during high mass
transfer phases in the limit cycle. The irradiation instability may be enhanced
by consequential angular momentum losses, CAML, accompanying the limit cycle.
We investigate the secular evolution of cataclysmic binaries under the combined
effects of irradiation and CAML and show that faster than secular transfer
fluctuations that occur during these cycles can account for the observed
dispersion in disk luminosities or estimated accretion rates at a given orbital
period. If indeed irradiation-driven and CAML--assisted mass transfer
fluctuations on timescales faster than secular occur, as discussed in this
paper, then we may be able to predict the relative abundances of the different

relativistic, highly-collimated electron-proton beam interacts with a dense,
compact cloud as the jet propagates through the broad and perhaps narrow line
regions (BLR and NLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN). During the propagation
of the beam through the cloud, the process of excitation of plasma waves
becomes an important energy loss mechanism, especially for mildly relativistic
proton beams. We compute the expected spectra of gamma-rays from the decay of
neutral pions produced in hadronic collisions of the beam with the cloud,
taking into account collisionless losses of the electron-proton beam. This
model may explain the X-ray and TeV gamma-ray (both low and high emission
states) of Mrk 421 as a result of synchrotron emission of secondary pairs from
the decay of charged pions and gamma-ray emission from the decay of neutral
pions for the plausible cloud parameters. However clouds can not be too hot and
too dense. Otherwise the TeV gamma-rays can be attenuated by the bremsstrahlung
radiation in the cloud and the secondary pairs are not able to efficiently
produce synchrotron flares because of the dominant role of inverse Compton
scattering.
  The non-variable $\gamma$-ray emission observed from Mrk 421 in the EGRET
energy range cannot be described by the $\gamma$-rays from decay of neutral
pions provided that the spectrum of protons in the beam is well described by a
simple power law. These $\gamma$-rays might only be produced by secondary pairs
scattering the soft non-variable X-rays which might originate in the inner part
of the accretion disk.

evolution of the quantum field in the zero-mass and large-mass limits is
consistent with the Einstein equations for the background geometry. This choice
of modes is also consistent with zero production of these particles and thus
corresponds to a preferred vacuum state preserved by the evolution. In the
zero-mass limit, we find that the quantum field equation implies the Einstein
equation for the scale factor of a radiation-dominated universe; in the
large-mass case, it implies the corresponding Einstein equation for a
matter-dominated universe. Conversely, if the classical radiation-dominated or
matter-dominated Einstein equations hold, there is no production of scalar
particles in the zero and large mass limits, respectively. The suppression of
particle production in the large mass limit is over and above the expected
suppression at large mass. Our results hold for a certain class of conformally
ultrastatic background geometries and therefore generalize previous results by
one of us for spatially flat Robertson-Walker background geometries. In these
geometries, we find that the temporal part of the graviton equations reduces to
the temporal equation for a massless minimally coupled scalar field, and
therefore the results for massless particle production hold also for gravitons.
Within the class of modes we study, we also find that the requirement of zero

calls for an out of equilibrium quantum field treatment. Moreover, the high
energy densities involved make necessary the use of non-perturbative approaches
as large N and Hartree methods. We start these lectures by introducing such
non-perturbative out of equilibrium methods in cosmological universes. We
discuss the renormalization procedure and the choice of initial conditions. We
then study the nonlinear dynamics of quantum fields in matter and radiation
dominated FRW and de Sitter universes. For a variety of initial conditions, we
compute the evolution of the inflaton,its quantum fluctuations and the equation
of state. We investigate the explosive particle production due to spinodal
unstabilities and parametric amplification in FRW and de Sitter universes with
and without symmetry breaking.We find that the particle production is sensitive
to the expansion of the universe.For symmetry breaking scenarios, we determine
generic late time fields behavior for FRW and deSitter cosmologies.We find that
quantum fluctuations damp in FRW as the square of the scale factor while the
order parameter approaches a minimum of the potential at the same rate.We con-
sider an O(N) inflaton model coupled self-consistently to gravity in the semi-
classical approximation for a `new inflation' scenario. We find that spinodal
instabilities drive the growth of non-perturbatively large quantum fluctuations
which shut off inflation. These fluctuations assemble with the inflaton zero
mode yielding a new effective field that actually rolls down behaving classi-
cally. We compute the amplitude and index for scalar density and tensor
perturbations. In all models of this type the spinodal instabilities produce a
`red' spectrum of primordial scalar density perturbations.

extensions. We also construct a new infinite family of N=2 supersymmetric
hierarchies by exhibiting the corresponding super Lax operators. The new
realization of N=4 supersymmetry on the two general N=2 superfields, bosonic
spin 1 and fermionic spin 1/2, is discussed.

  uses the style file bal.sty",,,,"solv-int nlin.SI",,"  A straightforward algorithm for the symbolic computation of higher-order
symmetries of nonlinear evolution equations and lattice equations is presented.
The scaling properties of the evolution or lattice equations are used to
determine the polynomial form of the higher-order symmetries. The coefficients
of the symmetry can be found by solving a linear system. The method applies to
polynomial systems of PDEs of first-order in time and arbitrary order in one
space variable. Likewise, lattices must be of first order in time but may
involve arbitrary shifts in the discretized space variable.
  The algorithm is implemented in Mathematica and can be used to test the
integrability of both nonlinear evolution equations and semi-discrete lattice
equations. With our Integrability Package, higher-order symmetries are obtained
for several well-known systems of evolution and lattice equations. For PDEs and
lattices with parameters, the code allows one to determine the conditions on
these parameters so that a sequence of higher-order symmetries exist. The
existence of a sequence of such symmetries is a predictor for integrability.
