identified at the intersections of the surface of last scattering as seen by
different ``copies'' of the observer. Since the surface of last scattering is a
two-sphere, these intersections will be circles, regardless of the background
geometry or topology. We therefore propose a statistic that is sensitive to all
small, locally homogeneous topologies. Here, small means that the distance to

show features typical of Be/X-ray binaries. Superimposed on a weak emission
from the IC 1396 nebula, strong H$\alpha$ (4.5 nm EW) and H$\beta$ (0.3 nm EW)
lines are seen in emission with the other Balmer lines in absorption.
Significant interstellar absorption features are also detected, including a
strong Na I doublet (589 nm) and diffuse bands at 443, 578 and 628 nm. From the
shape of the continuum as well as the lines present in the spectrum, a most
probable spectral type of B1-B2V is derived with a reddening of
E$_{B-V}$=1.3$\pm$0.1. The reddening value is corroborated by the measure of
interstellar absorption features, except for the sodium line which appears to
be in excess and may be partly from circumstellar origin. The optical
absorption is fully consistent with the column density derived from X-ray
spectra, therefore confirming the identification. Despite apparent spatial
coincidence, the source is located much further away than the local intervening
nebula IC1396. The best estimate of the distance is D=(3.8$\pm$0.6) kpc, which
places the source in the outer Perseus arm of the Galaxy. At this distance, the
X-ray quiescent luminosity is (3-6) 10$^{33}$ erg.s$^{-1}$, thus comparable to
typical Be/X-ray binary low states.

new detections. Combining the results of this survey with previous radial
velocity, optical speckle, and direct imaging Hyades surveys, the detected
multiplicity of the sample is: 98 singles, 59 binaries, and 10 triples.
  A statistical analysis of this sample investigates a variety of multiple star
formation and evolution theories. Accounting for the inability to detect high
flux ratio binaries results in an implied companion star fraction (csf) of 0.30
+/- 0.06 in this separation range 0.""1 to 1.""07 (5 to 50 AU). The Hyades csf is
intermediate between the values derived from observations of T Tauri stars (T
Tauri csf=0.40 +/- 0.08) and solar neighborhood G-dwarfs (G-dwarf csf=0.14 +/-
0.03). This result allows for an evolution of the csf from an initially high
value for the pre-main sequence to that found for main sequence stars. Within
the Hyades, the csf is independent of the radial distance from the cluster
center and the primary star mass. The distribution of mass ratios is best fit
by a power law q^(-1.3 +/- 0.3) and shows no dependence on the primary mass,
binary separation, or the radial distance from the cluster center. Overall, the
Hyades data are consistent with scale-free fragmentation, but inconsistent with
capture in small clusters and disk-assisted capture in small clusters. Without
testable predictions, scale-dependent fragmentation and disk fragmentation
cannot be assessed with the Hyades data.

bar and strong spiral structure in its HI disk extending well beyond its
optical disk. We propose here that NGC 2915 has a dark or faint (not yet
observed) massive disk component. By massive we mean of the same order as the
HI gas mass which ranges from 0.5 -- 10 Msol/pc^2. We present three different
dynamical arguments based on bar and spiral structure that an additional disk
mass component is required. The additional mass requirements from these three
dynamical arguments depend upon the distance of the galaxy in the same way. If
the galaxy were at a distance twice that estimated then the additional mass
required would be negligible. Virgocentric models show that then its radial
velocity would be 250-500 km/s below its local bulk flow value. Local flow
models suggest that this is unlikely, however they also do not exclude it at
high confidence levels. Detection of a quiescent or faint stellar disk
population would be an exciting prospect since it would be strong evidence for
a previous epoch of star formation in a previously low surface brightness
galaxy. Then NGC 2915 would be an example of a galaxy which has faded and so
could have been one of the faint blue galaxy population observed at moderate
redshift.

Galaxy to the Magellanic Clouds. Unlike previous authors, we assume neither a
steepened IMF nor selective galactic winds, since among the alpha-particle
elements only oxygen shows a large deficit relative to iron and a similar
deficit is also found in Galactic supergiants. Thus we assume yields and time
delays identical to those we previously assumed for the solar neighbourhood. We
include inflow and non-selective galactic winds and consider both smooth and
bursting star formation rates, the latter giving a better fit to the
age-metallicity relations. We predict essentially solar abundance ratios for
primary elements and these seem to fit most of the data within their
substantial scatter. Our LMC model also gives a remarkably good fit to the
anomalous Galactic halo stars discovered by Nissen & Schuster (1997).
  Our models predict current ratios of SNIa to core-collapse supernova rates
enhanced by 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively relative to the solar
neighbourhood, in fair agreement with ratios found by Cappellaro et al. (1993)
for Sdm-Im relative to Sbc galaxies, but these ratios are sensitive to detailed
assumptions about the bursts. We consider that the high SNIa/SNII ratios found
in some late-type galaxies are related to their star formation history rather
than to any differences in the IMF.

statistical analysis of galaxy catalogs have revealed a fractal structure at
small-scales (\lambda < 100 h^{-1} Mpc), with a fractal dimension D=1.5-2
(Sylos Labini et al 1996). We study the thermodynamics of a self-gravitating
system with the theory of critical phenomena and finite-size scaling and show
that gravity provides a dynamical mechanism to produce this fractal structure.
We develop a field theoretical approach to compute the galaxy distribution,
assuming them to be in quasi-isothermal equilibrium. Only a limited, (although
large), range of scales is involved, between a short-distance cut-off below
which other physics intervene, and a large-distance cut-off, where the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium is not satisfied. The galaxy ensemble can be considered at
critical conditions, with large density fluctuations developping at any scale.
  From the theory of critical phenomena, we derive the two independent critical
exponents nu and eta and predict the fractal dimension D = 1/nu to be either
1.585 or 2, depending on whether the long-range behaviour is governed by the
Ising or the mean field fixed points, respectively. Both set of values are
compatible with present observations. In addition, we predict the scaling
behaviour of the gravitational potential to be r^{-(1 + eta)/2}. That is,
r^{-0.5} for mean field or r^{- 0.519} for the Ising fixed point. The theory
allows to compute the three and higher density correlators without any
assumption or Ansatz. We find that the N-points density scales as
r_1^{(N-1)(D-3)}, when r_1 >> r_i, 2 leq i leq N . There are no free parameters

millimeter wave transmission in the range 130-500GHz are reported for three
YBCO thin films. The experiment provides the absolute value for the penetration
depth at low temperature: the derivation from the transmission data and the
experimental uncertainty are discussed. We find a zero temperature penetration
depth of 199+/-20nm, 218+/-20nm and 218+/-20nm, for YBCO-50nm/LaAlO3
(pristine), YBCO-130nm/MgO and YBCO-50nm/LaAlO3 (irradiated) respectively. The
penetration depth exhibits a different behavior for the three films. In the
pristine sample, it shows a clear temperature and frequency dependence, namely
the temperature dependence is consistent with a linear variation, whose slope
decreases with frequency: this is considered as an evidence for the scattering
rate being of the order of the measuring frequency. A two fluids analysis
yields 1.7 10^{12} s^{-1}. In the two other samples, the penetration depth does
not display any frequency dependence, suggesting a significantly larger
scattering rate. The temperature dependence is different in these latter
samples. It is consistent with a linear variation for the YBCO/MgO sample, not
for the YBCO/LaAlO3 irradiated one, which exhibits a T^2 dependence up to 40K.
We have compared our data to the predictions of the d-wave model incorporating
resonant scattering and we do not find a satisfactory agreement. However, the
large value of the penetration depth at zero Kelvin in the pristine sample is a
puzzle and sheds some doubt on a straightforward comparison with the theory of
data from thin films, considered as dirty d-wave superconductors.

to search for disoriented chiral condensates (DCC) in the forward direction.
The MiniMax detector at the C0 collision region of the Tevatron was a telescope
of 24 multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC's) with a lead converter behind
the eighth MWPC, allowing the detection of charged particles and photon
conversions in an acceptance approximately a circle of radius 0.6 in
pseudorapidity-azimuthal-angle space, centered on a pseudorapidity of about 4.
  The use of standard Monte Carlo simulations (PYTHIA, GEANT) is described,
along with the simulation created by the MiniMax Collaboration to generate DCC
domains. A description of the data analysis software is given, including
detailed studies of its performance on data from the simulations.
  A set of robust observables is derived. These are insensitive to many
efficiencies and to the details of the modeling of the parent pion production
mechanisms, yet have distinguishable values for DCC and generic charged-neutral
distributions. Simulations show that the robust observables are insensitive to
detector efficiencies and to systematic errors in the data analysis software.
  The resulting values for robust observables for approximately 1.5 million
events are shown to be consistent with production by only generic mechanisms.
Results from samples of diffractive-tagged events and of high-multiplicity

first-order `vorticity' transition observed by Solomon et al. is confirmed, and
the location of the terminating critical point is established. New scaling
flows in (<A>,<P>) are observed associated with a large exponent kappa in the
range 4~5. The scaling flows give rise to a strong cross-over effect between
regions of high and low vorticity and are likely to induce an apparent signal
for scaling in the cross-over region which we propose explains the scaling
observed for RP(2), RP(3) and SO(4)-matrix models. The signal for this `pseudo'

the region in which computer simulations are done. We find that the RP(2) spin
model is in the same universality class as the O(3) spin model but that it is
likely to require a very large correlation length before the true scaling of
this class sets in. We conjecture that the scaling flows are due either to the
influence of a nearby new renormalized trajectory or to the ghost of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless trajectory in the associated XY model.

Although the lepton and c quark couplings agree well with Standard Model
predictions, those of the b quark show deviations of more than three standard
deviations. The effect is mainly in the right-handed b quark coupling, the
left-handed coupling being consistent (at the 2$\sigma$ level) with the
Standard Model prediction. The probability that the observed deviations of all

universality and the Standard Model is estimated to be 0.9%. The estimated

School on Fundamental Problems in Statistical Mechanics, held in Altenberg,
Germany, in August 1997. In these notes, we discuss at an elementary level
three themes concerning interface dynamics that play a role in pattern forming
systems: (i) We briefly review three examples of systems in which the normal
growth velocity is proportional to the gradient of a bulk field which itself
obeys a Laplace or diffusion type of equation (solidification, viscous fingers
and streamers), and then discuss why the Mullins-Sekerka instability is common
to all such gradient systems. (ii) Secondly, we discuss how underlying an
effective interface description of systems with smooth fronts or transition
zones, is the assumption that the relaxation time of the appropriate order
parameter field(s) in the front region is much smaller than the time scale of
the evolution of interfacial patterns. Using standard arguments we illustrate
that this is generally so for fronts that separate two (meta)stable phases: in
such cases, the relaxation is typically exponential, and the relaxation time in
the usual models goes to zero in the limit in which the front width vanishes.
(iii) We finally summarize recent results that show that so-called ``pulled''
or ``linear marginal stability'' fronts which propagate into unstable states
have a very slow universal power law relaxation. This slow relaxation makes the
usual ``moving boundary'' or ``effective interface'' approximation for problems
with thin fronts, like streamers, impossible.

bases, tensor product of U_{q \to 0}(sl(2) \oplus sl(2)) representations. Such
a construction might be compared to the baryon classification from quark
building blocks in elementary particles physics, one of the main differences
standing in the property of a crystal base to provide a natural order in the
state constituents, this order being crucial in the codon. Then an operator
ensuring the correspondence codon/amino-acid can be constructed out of the

Differences between the standard optical laser model and the atom laser are due
to a combination of factors, including the parameter regimes in which a typical
atom laser would operate, the different reservoir state which is appropriate
for atoms, and the different dispersion relations between atoms and photons. We
present results based on an exact method in the regimes in which the

pure Coulomb interactions, as a function of the masses and charges of the
particles. We present a certain number of general properties which allow to
answer a certain number of questions without or with less numerical
calculations.

  (in press)",,"10.1007/s100530050585",,"quant-ph",,"  Impressive pictures of moving Bose-Einstein condensates have been taken using
phase-contrast imaging M. R. Andrews et al., Science 273, 84 (1996). We
calculate the quantum backaction of this measurement technique. We find that
phase-contrast imaging is not a quantum nondemolition measurement of the atomic
density. Instead, the condensate gets gradually depleted at a rate that is
proportional to the light intensity and to the inverse cube of the optical wave
length. The fewer atoms are condensed the higher is the required intensity to
see a picture, and, consequently, the higher is the induced backaction. To
describe the quantum physics of phase-contrast imaging we put forward a new
approach to quantum-optical propagation. We develop an effective field theory
of paraxial optics in a fully quantized atomic medium.

  algebra","27 pages, latex, typos corrected",,,"ITEP-TH-76/97","solv-int hep-th nlin.SI",,"  An algebro-geometric approach to representations of Sklyanin algebra is
proposed. To each 2 \times 2 quantum L-operator an algebraic curve
parametrizing its possible vacuum states is associated. This curve is called
the vacuum curve of the L-operator. An explicit description of the vacuum curve
for quantum L-operators of the integrable spin chain of XYZ type with arbitrary
spin $\ell$ is given. The curve is highly reducible. For half-integer $\ell$ it
splits into $\ell +{1/2}$ components isomorphic to an elliptic curve. For
integer $\ell$ it splits into $\ell$ elliptic components and one rational
component. The action of elements of the L-operator to functions on the vacuum
curve leads to a new realization of the Sklyanin algebra by difference
operators in two variables restricted to an invariant functional subspace.
