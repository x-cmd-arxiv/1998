deep photometric surveys. We have used photometric redshifts to select
different samples of galaxies in the HDF, in order to study their clustering
properties within the 2.5<z<4.5 domain, in redshift bins of 0.5, using
different techniques. A strong clustering signal is found for redshift bins
including z~3.4 and leading to a present correlation length of r_0 = 4.1 +- 0.8
h^-1 Mpc (q_0=0.1) assuming linear evolution. An excess appears in the
correlation function of chip 2 with respect to the fit. This excess could be
associated to the main structure detected in this field, which contains 20% of
the objects identified at 3.4<z<3.9. Its dimensions are 3 h^-1 Mpc x 0.5 h^-1
Mpc. The galaxies at 3.4<z<3.9 exhibit a SFR of a few solar masses per year,
but their comoving density is a factor of ~50 higher than the population of
star-forming galaxies reported by Steidel et al. (1996b). The resulting star
formation rate density is at least 1.1 10^-2 h Msun/yr/Mpc^3 (1.8 10^-2 h
Msun/yr/Mpc^3) with q_0=0.1(0.5), slightly higher than the results by Madau et
al. (1996) at 2.5<z<3.5, and then incompatible with a global decrease of the
star formation in this redshift domain. These results on star formation and
clustering are consistent with a hierarchical scenario for galaxy formation.

of four high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs) obtained with the 10-m Keck I
telescope. A broad Mg II emission line is detected in the total and polarized
flux spectra of 3C 265 and 3C 277.2. The fractional polarization is high, and
both it and the position angle are constant with wavelength after accounting
for dilution by unpolarized starlight of the host galaxy, which can contribute
substantially. An extended unpolarized continuum similar to that observed in
other AGNs is also detected. Imaging polarimetry reveals a rough double-fan
morphology of the polarized light coincident with the extended aligned emission
regions, with the position angle essentially perpendicular to the radial
structure of the extended UV/optical emission, and with the degree of
polarization increasing with radius away from the nucleus. The radio jets lie
inside the extended emission regions and, like every radius, are roughly
perpendicular to the polarization PA. These results strengthen the view that
powerful radio galaxies would be called quasars if viewed from a proper
direction. Based on the polarimetric data presented in this paper and in
previous studies, scattering of radiation from an obscured quasar source
appears to be the preferred interpretation over jet-induced star formation for
explaining the alignment effect in HzRGs. Both electrons and dust can play a
major role in the scattering process. However, the lack of strong direct
evidence for either case, and our ignorance of the properties and distribution
of the scatterers in these galaxies make it very difficult to discriminate
between the two. Our data reveal a chance alignment of 3C 343.1 with a
foreground galaxy, which dominates the observed optical flux from the system.

Ia are well suited for measuring $H_0$. A straightforward maximum-light color
criterion can weed out the minority of observed events that are either
intrinsically subluminous or substantially extinguished by dust, leaving a
majority subsample that has observational absolute-magnitude dispersions of
less than $\sigma_{obs}(M_B) \simeq \sigma_{obs}(M_V) \simeq 0.3$ mag.
Correlations between absolute magnitude and one or more distance-independent SN
Ia or parent-galaxy observables can be used to further standardize the absolute
magnitudes to better than 0.2 mag. The absolute magnitudes can be calibrated in
two independent ways --- empirically, using Cepheid-based distances to parent
galaxies of SNe Ia, and physically, by light curve and spectrum fitting. At
present the empirical and physical calibrations are in agreement at $M_B \simeq
M_V \simeq -19.4$ or -19.5. Various ways that have been used to match
Cepheid-calibrated SNe Ia or physical models to SNe Ia that have been observed
out in the Hubble flow have given values of $H_0$ distributed throughout the
range 54 to 67 km/s Mpc$^{-1}$. Astronomers who want a consensus value of $H_0$

pursued. The steady supply of supernovae induced turbulence exponentiates the
total field energy, providing a significant seed mean field that can be
linearly stretched by shear. The observed micro-Gauss fields would be produced
primarily within one vertical diffusion time since it is only during this time
that linear stretching can compete with diffusion. This approach does not
invoke exponential mean field dynamo growth from the helicity $\a$-effect but
does employ turbulent diffusion, which limits the number of large scale
reversals. The approach could be of interest if the helicity effect is
suppressed independently of the turbulent diffusion. This is an important but
presently unresolved issue.

anisotropy becomes larger, there appears a noticeable difference in the
transverse component S^{xx}(q,\omega) between the two types of the exchange.
For the nearest-neighbor type, the peak frequency of S^{xx}(q,\omega) for each
q approaches the center of the continuum spectrum. On the contrary, the peak
frequency for the inverse-square type moves to the upper edge of the continuum,
and separates from the continuum for the anisotropy larger than the threshold
value. Whether the interaction between domain walls (solitons) is absent or
repulsive in the Ising limit leads to this difference in the behavior of
S^{xx}(q,\omega). In the longitudinal component S^{zz}(q,\omega), on the other
hand, the feature of the dynamics is scarcely different between the two types.

illustrate the method, we consider examples involving cubic nonlinearities in
an N-dimensional phase-space. These serve as a useful paradigm for describing
critical point phase transitions in numerous equilibrium and non-equilibrium
systems. The technique presented here is not perturbative. It consists in
developing the stochastic variable as a power series in time, and using this to
compute the short time expansion for the correlation functions. This, in turn,
is extrapolated to large times and Fourier transformed to obtain the spectrum.
  A stochastic diagram technique is developed to facilitate computation of the
coefficients of the relevant power series expansion. Two different types of
long-time extrapolation technique, involving either simple exponentials or
logarithmic rational approximations, are evaluated for third-order diagrams.
The analytical results thus obtained are compared with numerical simulations,
together with exact results available in special cases. The agreement is
excellent in the neighborhood of the critical point.

the value of $W$ can be systematically controlled without changing the number

see some sign of a trend towards the asymptotic perturbative behaviour. We find
that an interesting polarisation phenomenon occurs: the large topological
charges tend to have, on the average, the same sign and are over-screened by
the smaller charges which tend to have, again on the average, the opposite sign
to the larger instantons. We also calculate the topological susceptibility for
which we obtain a continuum value of about 187 MeV. We perform the calculations

restricts $m_{\tilde g}\leq 400$ GeV for a scalar soft breaking mass $m_0\leq
1$ TeV. Expected future data from Super Kamionkande and ICARUS will be
sensitive to the entire range of gluino mass for $m_0\leq 1$ TeV, and be able
to exclude the region $m_{\tilde g}\geq 500$ GeV for $m_0\leq 5$ TeV. Effects

for a test of these models at the Tevatron and at the LHC are discussed. The
effects of non-universal soft breaking in the Higgs and the third generation

sensitive to these non-universal effects. The current data already eliminates
some regions of non-universalities. The constraints of proton stability on the

almost light-like circle has recently been shown to be plagued by divergences.
We argue that the light-like limit for M-theory probably is free of such
divergences due to, among others, the existence of the wrapping modes of the
membranes. To illustrate this, we consider superstring theory compactified on
an almost light-like circle. Specifically, we compute a one-loop four-point
amplitude in type II theory. As is well known, if the external states have
vanishing momenta in the compact dimension, the divergence in the light-like
limit is even stronger than in field theory. However, in the case of present
interest, where these external momenta are non-vanishing, there is a subtle
compensation and the resulting amplitude has a well-defined and finite
light-like limit. The net effect of taking the light-like limit is to replace
the integration over one of the moduli of the 4-punctured torus by a sum over a
discrete modulus taking values in a finite lattice on the torus. The same
result can also be obtained from a suitably ""Wick rotated"" amplitude computed
directly with a compact light-like circle.

context, the equations of motion of gravity coupled to a dilaton and n-form
field strengths. The unique algebraic rule we obtained does not lead to new
solutions while it manages to collect, in a systematic way, most of the
solutions (all those compatible with our ansatz) that have appeared in the
literature. We then consider bound states of zero binding energy where a third
brane is accomodated in the common and overall transverse directions. They are
given in terms of non-harmonic functions. A different algebraic rule emerges
for these last intersections, being identical to the intersection rule for
p-branes which only depend on the overall transverse coordinates. We clarify
the origin of this coincidence. The whole set of solutions in ten and eleven
dimensional theories is connected by dualities and dimensional reductions. They
are related to brane configurations recently used to study non-perturbative
phenomena in supersymmetric gauge theories.

Gel'fand-Dikii flows is not a group factorization, as would be expected; yet a
modification of the dressing method still works.

factorization problem, is given that the potentials are meromorphic in $x$ and
in the time variables. Potentials with Baker-Akhiezer functions include the
