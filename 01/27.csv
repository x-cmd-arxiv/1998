order of magnitude improvement in resolution over previous ground based spectra

are kinematically disturbed and split into two components whose velocity
separation is 1500 km/sec. The filaments associated with the radio lobe also
show a redshifted kinematic disturbance of the order of 300 km/sec which
probably is a consequence of the expansion of the radio plasma.
  Furthermore, the material enveloping the radio-jet is in a much higher
ionization state than that of the surrounding NLR gas. The highest excitation
is coincident with the jet axis where emission in the coronal line of [FeVII]
3769A is detected and the HeII 4686A is strong but where [OII] 3727A is
depressed. This large localized increase in ionization on the jet axis is
accompanied by the presence of an excess continuum. Because the electron
density is substantially larger in the jet compared to the surrounding NLR,
these results can only be explained if there is a more intense ionizing
continuum associated with the jet. This can be accomplished in a variety of
ways which include an intrinsically anisotropic nuclear radiation field, a
reduced gas covering factor or the presence of a local ionization source.
  The morphology, kinematics and, possibly, the ionization structure of the NLR

from the APM galaxy and galaxy cluster surveys, both in real space from the
inversion of projected statistics and in redshift space using the galaxy and

independent of cluster richness. At large separations, r >~5 h^-1 Mpc, Xi_cg
has a similar shape to the galaxy-galaxy and cluster-cluster autocorrelation
functions. Xi_cg in redshift space can be related to the real space Xi_cg by
convolution with an appropriate velocity field model. Here we apply a spherical
collapse model, which we have tested against N-body simulations, finding that
it provides a surprisingly accurate description of the averaged infall velocity
of matter into galaxy clusters. We use this model to estimate beta
(Omega^{0.6}/b) and find that it tends to overestimate the true result in
simulations by only ~10-30%. Application to the APM results yields beta=0.43
with beta < 0.87 at 95% confidence. We also compare the APM Xi_cg and galaxy
autocorrelations to results from popular cosmological models and derive two
independent estimates of the galaxy biasing expected as a function of scale.
Both low and critical density CDM models require anti-biasing by a factor ~2 on
scales r <~ 2 h^-1Mpc and an MDM model is consistent with a constant biasing
factor on all scales. We use the velocity fields predicted from the different
models to distort the APM real space cross-correlation function. Comparison
with the APM redshift space Xi_cg yields an estimate of the value of Omega^0.6
needed in each model. Only the low Omega model is fully consistent with
observations, with MDM marginally excluded at the ~2 sigma level.

theoretical model in which it is assumed that the magnetic hypothesis
explaining the flat rotation curve also explains the truncation. Once stars are
born, the centripetal magnetic force previously acting on the progenitor gas
cloud is suddenly interrupted, and stars must move to larger orbits or escape.
The agreement between theoretical and observed truncation curves is very
satisfactory. Parameters defining the disc gas rotation curve should therefore
be related to those defining the truncation. It is predicted that rotation
curves that quickly reach the asymptotic value $\theta_0 = \theta (r=\infty)$
would have small truncation radii. On the contrary, $r_t$ and $\theta_0$

mode frequencies reproduce possibly close the observations. Models are
constrained by the mean photometric and spectroscopic data for the star.
However, the strongest constraint on the effective temperture is from the
requirement that the modes excited in the star fall into the range of the modes
driven by the opacity mechanism.
  Our models are built with the standard stellar evolution code allowing no
overshooting from the convective core. Effects of rotation are taken into
account both in stellar evolution and in linear nonadiabatic oscillation
calculations. Uniform rotation rate and conservation of the global angular
momentum during evolution are assumed.
  We find several distinct mode identifications and associated stellar models
leading to frequency fits of similar quality. Determination of the l values for
some of the modes could remove the ambiguity. None of the fits is satifactory:
the mean departures exceed the mean observational frequency error by at least
one order of magnitude. The fits could be improved by means of adjusting model
parameters that were kept fixed. However, such effort will be meaningful only
after improving accuracy in calculation of the effects of rotation in

contains a homogeneous magnetic field. The full space, time and momentum
dependence of the electron distribution is used in this calculation. It is
shown that the ""homogeneous"" synchrotron model is recovered, provided the
downstream speed of the plasma away from the shock front is nonrelativistic,
and provided that the light travel times across the face of the shock front is
unimportant. By varying the rate at which particles are picked up by the
acceleration process, we calculate the time-dependence of the spectra. Since
the magnetic field strength is assumed constant within the emission region,
each frequency band can be identified with electrons of a particular energy. We
find that for a band in which the electrons are accelerated rapidly compared to
the rate at which they cool, the spectra typically harden during phases of
rising flux, and soften during phases of falling flux, as has been observed in
the objects PKS 2155-304 and Mkn 421. However, in a frequency band in which the
timescales are comparable, the reverse behaviour is to be expected. We discuss
the extent to which observations of both the stationary spectrum and the

applied to a fluid of spherical particles with a pair potential given by a
hard-core repulsion and a Yukawa attractive tail $w(r)=-\exp [-z(r-1)]/r$. This
potential allows one to take advantage of the known analytical properties of
the solution to the Ornstein-Zernike equation for the case in which the direct
correlation function outside the repulsive core is given by a linear
combination of two Yukawa tails and the radial distribution function $g(r)$
satisfies the exact core condition $g(r)=0$ for $r<1$. The predictions for the
thermodynamics, the critical point, and the coexistence curve are compared here
to other theories and to simulation results. In order to unambiguously assess
the ability of the SCOZA to locate the critical point and the phase boundary of
the system, a new set of simulations has also been performed. The method
adopted combines Monte Carlo and finite-size scaling techniques and is
especially adapted to deal with critical fluctuations and phase separation. It
is found that the version of the SCOZA considered here provides very good

curve. For the interaction range considered here, given by $z=1.8$, the

different processes influencing the demand and supply, and their mathematical
transcription. We emphasize the importance of feedback effects of price
variations onto themselves. Risk aversion, in particular, leads to an up-down
symmetry breaking term which is responsible for crashes, where `panic' is self
reinforcing. It is also responsible for the sudden collapse of speculative
bubbles. Interestingly, these crashes appear as rare, `activated' events, and
have an exponentially small probability of occurence. We predict that the shape
of the falldown of the price during a crash should be logarithmic. The normal
regime, where the stock price exhibits behavior similar to that of a random
walk, however reveals non trivial correlations on different time scales, in
particular on the time scale over which operators perceive a change of trend.

$K$ is usually nonzero and spatially variable, so none of the special cases of
York's conformal-decomposition algorithm apply, and the full 4-vector nonlinear
York equations must be solved numerically.
  We discuss the construction of dynamic black hole initial data slices using
this technique: We perturb a known black hole slice via some Ansatz, apply the
York decomposition (using another Ansatz for the inner boundary conditions) to
project the perturbed field variables back into the constraint hypersurface,
and finally optionally apply a numerical 3-coordinate transformation to (eg)
restore an areal radial coordinate.
  In comparison to other initial data algorithms, the key advantage of this
algorithm is its flexibility: $K$ is unrestricted, allowing the use of whatever
slicing is most suitable for (say) a time evolution.
  We have implemented this algorithm for the spherically symmetric scalar field
system. We present numerical results for a number of Eddington-
Finkelstein--like initial data slices containing black holes surrounded by
scalar field shells. Using 4th order finite differencing with resolutions of
$\Delta r/r \approx 0.02$ (0.01) near the (Gaussian) perturbations, the
numerically computed energy and momentum constraints for the final slices are
$\ltsim 10^{-8}$ ($10^{-9}$) and $\ltsim 10^{-9}$ ($10^{-10}$) in magnitude.
  Finally, we briefly discuss the errors incurred when interpolating data from
one grid to another, as in numerical coordinate transformation or horizon
finding. We show that for the usual moving-local-interpolation schemes, even
for smooth functions the interpolation error is not smooth.

for polarimetry at RHIC. Coulomb-nuclear interference (CNI) in pp elastic
scattering leads to a nearly energy-independent left-right asymmetry A_N(t) at
small t. The systematical uncertainty of this method is evaluated to be ~ 10%.
The CNI in proton-nucleus elastic scattering is predicted to result in larger
values of A_N(t) and occurs at larger momentum transfer than in pp elastic
scattering. This energy independent asymmetry can be used for the polarimetry.
As an absolute polarimeter one can use elastic pp scattering on a fixed target
at large |t| ~ 1 - 1.5 GeV^2, where A_N(t) is reasonably large and nearly

Laplace sum rules based upon isovector and isoscalar non-strange $\bar{q}q$
currents. The hadronic content of these sum rules incorporates deviations from
the narrow resonance approximation anticipated from physical resonance widths.
The field theoretical content of these sum rules incorporates
purely-perturbative QCD contributions to three-loop order, the direct
single-instanton contribution in the instanton liquid model, and leading
contributions from QCD-vacuum condensates. In the isovector channel, the
results we obtain are compatible with a$_0$(1450) being the lowest-lying
$q\bar{q}$ resonance, and are indicative of a non-$q\bar{q}$ interpretation for
a$_0$(980). In the isoscalar channel, the results we obtain are compatible with
the lowest lying $q\bar{q}$ resonance being f$_0$(980) or a state somewhat
lighter than f$_0$(980) whose width is less than half of its mass. The dilaton
scenario for such a narrower $\sigma$-resonance is discussed in detail, and is
found compatible with sum rule predictions for the resonance coupling only if
the anomalous gluon-field portion of $\Theta_\mu^\mu$ dominates the matrix
element $<\sigma|\Theta_\mu^\mu|0>$. A linear sigma-model interpretation of the
lowest-lying resonance's coupling, when compared to the coupling predicted by
sum rules, is indicative of a renormalization-group invariant light-quark mass
between 4 and 6 MeV.

oblique corrections to the electroweak sector which decouple for large
