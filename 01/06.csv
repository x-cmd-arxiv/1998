individually emitting periodic or quasi-periodic gravitational waves in the

combined signals, by exploiting the amplitude modulation of the received waves
as the antenna changes its orientation with respect to fixed stars. This
modulation is directly related to the amount of anisotropy present in the
source distribution, and, if detected, could give valuable information about
the spatial distribution of neutron stars in our Galaxy.

spectrum that can be used to evaluate the expected anisotropy in CDM models for
any arbitrary ionization history. In a flat Universe, CDM models normalized to
cluster abundances produce rms temperature anisotropies of 0.8--2.4 $\mu$K on
arcminute angular scales for a constant ionization fraction of unity, whereas
an ionization fraction of 0.2 yields rms anisotropies of 0.3--0.8 $\mu$K. In an
open and/or high-baryon-density Universe, the level of anisotropy is somewhat
higher. The signal in some of these models may be detectable with planned
interferometry experiments. The damping of the acoustic peaks in the
primary-anisotropy spectrum at degree angular scales depends primarily on the
optical depth and only secondarily on the epoch of reionization. On the other
hand, the amplitude of Ostriker-Vishniac anisotropies depends sensitively on
the epoch of reionization. Therefore, when combined with the estimate of the
reionization optical depth provided by maps of degree-scale anisotropies, the
Ostriker-Vishniac effect can provide a unique probe of the epoch of
reionization.

also become our most powerful tool to distinguish contending models and to
determine their cosmological parameters. To realize this goal, more than 20
observational groups and two new satellites are gearing up to make precise
measurements of the CMB at small angular scales. In such a situation it is
important to keep track of what the CMB data can already say about cosmological
parameters. Current CMB data can already be used to constrain cosmological
parameters. The results are model dependent. We have obtained contraints on
Hubble's constant h and the density of the Universe Omega_{o} in the context of
open and critical density CDM models with Lambda=0. In critical density models
we obtain h=0.30^{+0.18}_{-0.07}. This low value is inconsistent with direct
measurements of h but fully consistent with four other cosmological
measurements: Big Bang nucleosynthesis, cluster baryonic fraction, age
constraints from globular clusters and limits on the shape parameter Gamma of
matter power spectra (in Omega_{o}=1 models). If Omega_{o} is left as a free
parameter the constraints on h are less restrictive: h=0.40^{+0.57}_{-0.14}.
This is fully consistent with local $h$ measurements and the four other
cosmological measurements mentioned above. The best-fit density is Omega_{o}=
0.85 and we set an upper limit of Omega_{o} > 0.4 at ~ 95% CL. At this

intermittency in forced Burgers turbulence. The mapping between Burgers'
equation and the problem of a directed polymer in a random medium is used in
order to study the fully developped turbulence in the limit of large
dimensions. The stirring force corresponds to a quenched (spatio temporal)
random potential for the polymer, correlated on large distances. A replica
symmetry breaking solution of the polymer problem provides the full probability
distribution of the velocity difference $u(r)$ between points separated by a
distance $r$ much smaller than the correlation length of the forcing. This
exhibits a very strong intermittency which is related to regions of shock
waves, in the fluid, and to the existence of metastable states in the directed
polymer problem. We also mention some recent computations on the finite
dimensional problem, based on various analytical approaches (instantons,
operator product expansion, mapping to directed polymers), as well as a
conjecture on the relevance of Burgers equation (with the length scale playing
the role of time) for the description of the functional renormalisation group

surface in the two-dimensional Hubbard model. We use the FLEX approximation to
self-consistently generate the Matsubara Green's functions and then we
analytically continue to the real axis to obtain the quasiparticle spectral
functions. We compare the spectral functions found in the nearest neighbor
hopping only Hubbard model with those found when second neighbor hopping is
included. This separates the effects of nesting, the Van Hove singularity and
the short-ranged antiferromagnetic correlations. The quasiparticle scattering
rate is enhanced along the (0,pi) to (pi,pi) Brillouin zone diagonal. When the
density is close to half-filling these 'hot-spots' lie on the Fermi surface and
the scattering rate increases with decreasing temperature. For the next-nearest
neighbor hopping scenario we observe a large range of doping where there is no
antiferromagnetism but the scattering rate has a linear temperature dependence.
On decreasing the interaction this non-Fermi liquid behavior is confined to
doping levels where the Fermi energy lies near to the Van Hove singularity. We
conclude that the 'hot-spots' are associated with the antiferromagnetic phase
transition while the linear temperature dependence of the scattering rate is
associated with the Van Hove singularity.

inflationary result"" has been finally proven. The result itself is formulated
as: ``the closer the inflationary epoch is to the de Sitter space-time, the
less important are large-scale gravitational waves in the CMBR today"".
Beginning from the basic equations of Grishchuk [2, 3] the authors say [1] that
Grishchuk's conclusion about approximate equality of metric amplitudes for
gravitational waves and density perturbations ``is wrong because the time
evolution of the scalar metric perturbation through the (smooth) reheating
transition was not calculated correctly"". They reiterate a claim about ``big
amplification"" of scalar perturbations (in contrast to gravitational waves)
during reheating. The authors say [1] that after appropriate correction they
have recovered the ""standard result"" within Grishchuk's approach. It is shown
in this Comment that the ""big amplification"" is a misinterpretation. There is
no difference in the evolution of long-wavelength metric perturbations for
gravitational waves and density perturbations: they both stay approximately
constant. The influence of cosmological transitions on the evolution is none at
all, as long as the wavelength of the perturbation is much larger than the
Hubble radius. It is shown that from the approach of [2, 3] follow the
conclusions of [2, 3] without change. Finally, it is argued that the ``standard
inflationary result"" does not follow from the correct evolution and quantum
normalization of density perturbations.

and magnetic $FI$ terms within a manifestly supersymmetric formulation. We find
that after dualization of even one $FI$ term N=2 SUSY is realized in a partial
breaking mode off shell. In the case of two $FI$ terms, this regime is
preserved on shell. The N=2 SUSY algebra is shown to be modified on
gauge-variant objects.

times SU product gauge group first. The chiral theory is then an orientifold
projection of the product gauge group. An interesting observation in the brane
picture is that there are transitions between chiral and non chiral models.
These transitions are closely related to small instanton transitions in six
dimensions.

To second order in the coupling the particle number conserving part of the

the contribution of the second term to mass spectrum depends on the explicit
form of unitary transformation and may influence the spin-orbit.

string theory and the asymptotic properties of anti-de Sitter space, without

advocated by Susskind.

the field of nuclear astrophysics. We calculate direct neutron capture on the
even-even isotopes $^{124-145}$Sn and $^{208-238}$Pb with energy levels,
masses, and nuclear density distributions taken from different
nuclear-structure models. The utilized structure models are a
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model, a relativistic mean field theory, and a
macroscopic-microscopic model based on the finite-range droplet model and a
folded-Yukawa single-particle potential. Due to the differences in the
resulting neutron separation and level energies, the investigated models yield
capture cross sections sometimes differing by orders of magnitude. This may
also lead to differences in the predicted astrophysical r-process paths.
Astrophysical implications are discussed.

to create (or destroyed) a particle-hole ($ph$) or delta-hole ($\Delta h$) pair
is analyzed. Correlations of the random phase approximation (RPA) type and self
energy insertions are considered. For RPA correlations we have developed a
scheme which includes explicitly the $\Delta$ and the exchange terms. Self
energy insertions over $ph$ and $\Delta h$ bubbles are studied. Several
residual interactions based on a contact plus a ($\pi + \rho$)-meson exchange
potential are used. All calculations are performed in non-relativistic nuclear
matter. The main effect of the $\Delta$ is to reduce the intensity over the
nuclear quasi-elastic peak. Exchange RPA terms are very important, while the
self energy depends strongly on the residual interaction employed. We compare
our final result with data for $^{40}Ca$ at momentum transfer $q=410$ and
$q=550$ MeV/c.

shell of neutral and charged sodium clusters are studied for different sizes.
We consider spherical clusters and calculate the Auger-transition probabilities

  We obtain that Auger emission processes are energetically not allowed for
neutral and positively charged sodium clusters. In general, the Auger
probabilities in small Na$_N^-$ clusters are remarkably different from the
atomic ones and exhibit a rich size dependence.
  The Auger decay times of most of the cluster sizes studied are orders of
magnitude larger than in atoms and might be comparable with typical
fragmentation times.
