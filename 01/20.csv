that the nuclear disk in M87 is in Keplerian rotation around a black hole with
a mass of (2 - 3)x10^9 M_sol. A deep (6 orbits), high resolution H-alpha+[NII]
PC2 HST image shows a trailing, three arm spiral superposed on the underlying
nuclear disk. Several of the extended filaments appear to connect directly to
the disk. The filaments extending to the NW appear to be twisted, as in NGC
4258. Earlier arguments that the NW filaments are flowing from the nucleus are
supported by the presence of blue shifted non-Keplerian components within 20 pc
of the nucleus. The gas in the blue and red shifted non-Keplerian components
has negative energy and will fall back into the nucleus. The morphological and
kinematical observations can be explained by assuming that the filaments
originate in a bidirectional wind from the disk. Such a wind will carry away
angular momentum, enabling gas in the disk to move toward the black hole.
  Small (r ~ 1""; r ~ 100-200 pc), well-defined dusty (D-type) and ionized
(I-type) ""nuclear"" disks are common in elliptical galaxies. We suggest that the
size of the black hole's radius of influence R_BH relative to the radius of the
nuclear disk R_disk determines whether the disk will be a D-type or I-type.
I-type disks (M87 and M81) occur when R_BH > R_disk. Differential Keplerian
rotation throughout the disk may then generate turbulence and shocks that
ionize the gas. D-type disks (NGC 4261 and NGC 6251) occur when R_BH << R_disk.
The regions of a disk that are exterior to R_BH will rotate at approximately
constant angular velocity in the galaxy's potential, shocks will be suppressed,
and the gas will remain cold and dusty. Intermediate D/I types (3C264) may
occur when R_BH is a significant fraction of the disk's radius.

blue continua or a UV-excess. Any amount of dust along the line-of-sight is
expected to drastically extinguish the optical/UV flux leading to a selection
bias. Radio surveys however should suffer no bias against extinction by dust.
Recently, a large complete sample of radio-selected quasars has become
available (the `Parkes sample'). A majority of these sources exhibit
optical--to--near-infrared continua that are exceedingly `red', very unlike
those of quasars selected optically. The purpose of this thesis, broadly
speaking, is to explore the problem of incompleteness in optical quasar surveys
due to obscuration by dust, and to interpret the relatively `red' continua
observed in the Parkes quasar sample. The first part of this thesis explores
the observational consequences of an intervening (foreground) cosmological dust
component, such as that located in galaxies and clusters. The second part
examines the continuum properties of Parkes-quasars in the framework of a
number of absorption and emission mechanisms to assess the importance of
extinction by dust. It is found that spectroscopic and photometric data for the
``reddest'' quasars (with B-K>5) is best explained by the dust model, rather
than ``purely'' by an intrinsic emission property.

high collapse redshifts indicated by these ages, there must be a minimum level
of power in the density fluctuation spectrum on galaxy scales. This paper
compares the required power with that inferred from other high-redshift
populations. If the collapse redshifts for the old red galaxies are in the
range $z_c\simeq 6$ -- 8, there is general agreement between the various
tracers on the required inhomogeneity on 1-Mpc scales. This level of
small-scale power requires the Lyman-limit galaxies to be approximately
$\nu\simeq 3.0$ fluctuations, implying a very large bias parameter $b\simeq 6$.
The high collapse redshifts of the red galaxies as deduced from gravitational
collapse provides independent support for the ages estimated from their stellar
populations. Such early-forming galaxies are rare, and their contribution to
the cosmological stellar density is consistent with an extrapolation to higher
redshifts of the star-formation rate measured at $z<5$; there is no evidence
for a general era of spheroid formation at extreme redshifts.

strongly suggesting that the lens is an edge-on spiral galaxy. These

the oblateness and velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo around the
lensing galaxy. From an analytical model we find a lower limit on the halo
oblateness $q_\rmn{halo}=(c/a)_{\rho}\ga0.4$; more detailed numerical models
give a lower limit $q_\rmn{h}\ga0.5$. We determine an average halo velocity
dispersion of $\sigma_{halo}=190\pm 15$ km/s over all non-singular isothermal
elliptical (NIE) halo models. Constraining the models to larger and more
massive disks, decreases this average by only 10 km/s. A lower limit of
$\sigma_{halo}\ga 150$ km/s is found, even for disk masses larger then the mass
inside the Einstein radius. This lower limit indicates the need for a massive
dark matter halo, contributing at least half of the mass inside the Einstein
radius. Time delay calculations give $(54\pm3)/h_{50}$ days for the NIE halo
model and $(70\pm4)/h_{50}$ days for the modified Hubble profile (MHP) halo
model. Although the time delay for both NIE and MHP halo models is well
constrained on our parameter grid, it strongly depends on the halo surface
density profile. We furthermore find that the presence of a flat luminous mass

dependence of the flow, and turbulent diffusion, described by means of a
stochastic model for particle motion.
  Rather than looking at the details of particle trajectories, fluid exchange
is studied in terms of markovian approximations. The two-dimensional physical
space accessible to fluid particles is subdivided into regions characterized by
different Lagrangian behaviours. From the observed transitions between regions
it is possible to derive a number of relevant quantities characterizing
transport and mixing in the studied flow regime, such as residence times,
meridional mixing, correlation functions. These estimated quantities are
compared with the corresponding ones resulting from the actual simulations. The
outcome of the comparison suggests the possibility of describing in a
satisfactory way at least some of the mixing properties ot the system through
the very simplified approach of a first order markovian approximation, whereas
other properties exhibit memory patterns of higher order.

intensity peaks with respect to the positions of the corresponding
reciprocal-space minima of the effective interatomic interaction towards the

of the temperature behaviour of the splitting, such shift implies an increase
of the splitting with increasing temperature for all compositions considered in

automatically both for the quantum coherence and the trapping-induced
localization. The localized character of eigenvectors and the specific aspect
of the density of states at a given magnetic flux are correlated with the
behaviour of the mentioned resistances as function of the Fermi energy. The
Hall insulator and quantum Hall regimes are evidentiated. The dependence on
magnetic field of the configurational averages of the longitudinal and Halll
resistance is studied in a purely quantum-mechanical approach. Both negative
and positive magnetoresistances are found.

conductivity has two features: a narrow mode at zero frequency, with a small
spectral weight, and a mode centered around 200 cm^{-1}, with nearly all of the
spectral weight expected for the relevant number of carriers and single
particle bandmass. We argue that these features are characteristic of a nearly
one-dimensional half- or quarter-filled band with Coulomb correlations, and
evaluate the finite energy mode in terms of a one-dimensional Mott insulator.
At high frequencies (\hbar\omega > t_\perp, the transfer integral perpendicular
to the chains), the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity
\sigma_1(\omega) is in agreement with calculations based on an interacting

deviations from a simple Drude response, and can be adequately described with a

spacetime without specifying the detailed `molecular structure' of the quantum
spacetime, using the known properties of blackholes. I give detailed arguments,
essentially based on the behaviour of quantum systems near the event horizon,
which suggest that event horizon acts as a magnifying glass to probe Planck
length physics even in those contexts in which the spacetime curvature is
arbitrarily low. The quantum state describing a blackhole, in any microscopic
description of spacetime, has to possess certain universal form of density of
states which can be ascertained from general considerations. Since a blackhole
can be formed from the collapse of any physical system with a low energy
Hamiltonian H, it is suggested that when such a system collapses to form a
blackhole, it should be described by a modified Hamiltonian of the form
$H^2_{\rm mod} =A^2 \ln (1+ H^2/A^2)$ where $A^2 \propto E_P^2$.I also show
that it is possible to construct several physical systems which have the
blackhole density of states and hence will be indistinguishable from a
blackhole as far as thermodynamic interactions are concerned. In particular,
blackholes can be thought of as one-particle excitations of a class of {\it
nonlocal} field theories with the thermodynamics of blackholes arising
essentially from the asymptotic form of the dispersion relation satisfied by
these excitations. These field theoretic models have correlation functions with
a universal short distance behaviour, which translates into the generic
behaviour of semiclassical blackholes. Several implications of this paradigm
are discussed.

convergence to the exact analytic limit.

Cranked Relativistic Mean Field (CRMF) theory on the example of superdeformed
rotational bands observed in the A~140-150 mass region. Applying the effective
alignment approach it is shown that CRMF theory provides a reasonable
description of the alignment properties of the single-particle orbitals. The
agreement with experiment is good in most of the cases. This suggests that many
features of the observed superdeformed bands can be well understood in terms of
an almost undisturbed single-particle motion. The stability of the results with
respect to the parameterizations used in Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) theory
is also investigated, employing some frequently used non-linear effective
forces. It turns out, with the exception of the single-particle ordering in
superdeformed minimum, that the dependence of the calculated observables on the
parameterization is rather small.

  Systems with a Particle Picture; Model with pure Point Spectra","17 pages","Nuovo Cim. B114 (1999) 1225-1238",,"MPI-PhT/97-83","quant-ph",,"  For quantum mechanical systems an entropy-like quantity $S_q$ is defined.
$S_q$ can differ from the usually defined entropy $S$ and $S_q$ may increase
with time for an isolated system. The essential condition for the difference
between $S$ and $S_q$ is the assumption that the set {\bf A} of observables
which can be represented by a measurement is a proper subset of the set of
selfadjoint operators. The underlying idea is made visible in the case of
particle systems with non-trivial scattering. The model-character of the
reasoning comes from the fact that continuous spectra are replaced by
point-spectra. So it seems evident, that no direct connection exists between
$S_q$ and the Sinai-Kolmogorov-Entropy at least in this model with pure
point-spectra.
