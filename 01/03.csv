0<z<0.4, and show how accurate measurements of the frequency of SN events at
intermediate redshifts are valuable probes of the evolution of the stellar

220 at 1.1, 1.6, and 2.22 microns with NICMOS on the HST. The
diffraction-limited images at 0.1--0.2 arcsecond resolution clearly resolve
both nuclei of the merging galaxy system and reveal for the first time a number
of luminous star clusters in the circumnuclear envelope. The morphologies of
both nuclei are strongly affected by dust obscuration, even at 2.2 microns :
the primary nucleus (west) presents a crescent shape, concave to the south and
the secondary (eastern) nucleus is bifurcated by a dust lane with the southern
component being very reddened. In the western nucleus, the morphology of the
2.2 micron emission is most likely the result of obscuration by an opaque disk
embedded within the nuclear star cluster. The morphology of the central
starburst-cluster in the western nucleus is consistent with either a
circumnuclear ring of star formation or a spherical cluster with the bottom
half obscured by the embedded dust disk. Comparison of cm-wave radio continuum
maps with the near-infrared images suggests that the radio nuclei lie in the
dust disk on the west and near the highly reddened southern component of the
eastern complex. The radio nuclei are separated by 0.98 arcseconds
(corresponding to 364 pc at 77 Mpc) and the half-widths of the infrared nuclei
are approximately 0.2-0.5 arcseconds. At least 8, unresolved infrared sources
-- probably globular clusters -- are also seen in the circumnuclear envelope at

up to 100 keV and is best described by a broken power law with spectral indices
alpha1=0.70 and alpha2=0.94 below and above the break energy 5.8 keV.
  The X-ray flux from Mrk 501 declined and flared by about 30% within about 3

hardening of both power law components. The break energy remained constant.
  The observed broad band and X-ray spectra confirm recent observations, that
the synchrotron component in Mrk 501 can extend up to energies of 100 keV with
the maximum power being emitted at hard X-rays. On longer time-scales the
cut-off frequency of the synchrotron spectrum changes by more than two orders

  for publication in Euro. J. Phys B",,"10.1007/s100510050260",,"cond-mat",,"  The role of electron correlation on different pairing symmetries are
discussed in details where the electron correlation has been treated within the
slave boson formalism. It is shown that for a pure $s$ or pure $d$ wave pairing
symmetry, the electronic correlation suppresses the $s$ wave gap magnitude (as
well as the $T_c$) at a faster rate than that for the $d$ wave gap. On the
otherhand, a complex order parameter of the form ($s+id$) shows anomalous
temperature dependence. For example, if the temperature ($T_{c}^d$) at which
the $d$ wave component of the complex order parameter vanishes happens to be
larger than that for the $s$ wave component ($T_{c}^s$) then the growth of the
$d$ wave component is arrested with the onset of the $s$ wave component of the
order parameter. In this mixed phase however, we find that the suppression in
different components of the gap as well as the corresponding $T_c$ due to
coulomb correlation are very sensitive to the relative pairing strengths of $s$
and $d$ channels as well as the underlying lattice. Interestingly enough, in
such a scenario (for a case of $T_{c}^s > T_{c}^d$) the gap magnitude of the
$d$ wave component increases with electron correlation but not $T_{c}^d$ for
certain values of electron correlation. However, this never happens in case of
the $s$ wave component. We also calculate the temperature dependence of the
superconducting gap along both the high symmetry directions ($\Gamma$ - M and
$\Gamma $ - X) in a mixed $s+id$ symmetry pairing state and the thermal
variation of the gap anisotropy ($\frac{\Delta_{\Gamma - M}}{\Delta_{\Gamma -
X}}$) with electron correlation. The results are discussed with reference to
experimental observations.

contains a torsion force, although the action involves only the metric. This
force changes geodesic into autoparallel trajectories, which are a direct
manifestation of inertia. The geometric origin of the torsion force is a
closure failure of parallelograms. The torsion force changes the covariant
