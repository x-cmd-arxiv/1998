spectroscopy - of the mass M_{BH} of nuclear black holes for a sample of nearby
galaxies, we explore the dependence of galaxy nucleus emissivity at various
wavelengths on M_{BH}. We confirm an almost linear scaling of the black hole
mass with the baryonic mass of the host spheroidal galaxy. A remarkably tight
relationship is also found with both nuclear and total radio centimetric flux,
with a very steep dependence of the radio flux on M_{BH} (P\propto
M_{BH}^{2.5}). The high-frequency radio power is thus a very good tracer of a
super-massive black hole, and a good estimator of its mass. This, together with
the lack of significant correlations with the low-energy X-ray and far-IR flux,
supports the view that advection-dominated accretion is ruling the energy
output in the low-accretion rate regime. Using the tight dependence of total
radio power on M_{BH} and the rich statistics of radio emission of galaxies, we
derive an estimate of the mass function of remnants in the nearby universe.
This is compared with current models of quasar and AGN activity and of the
origin of the hard X-ray background (HXRB). As for the former, continuous
long-lived AGN activity is excluded by the present data with high significance,
whereas the assumption of a short-lived, possibly recurrent, activity pattern
gives remarkable agreement. The presently estimated black hole mass function
also implies that the HXRB has been produced by a numerous population (\sim
10^{-2} Mpc^{-3}) of moderately massive (M_{BH}\sim 10^7 M_\odot) black holes.

This model takes into account detailed nucleosynthesis and computes in detail

is that the development of a galactic wind is studied in detail by taking into
account the energy injected into the interstellar medium (ISM) from both

main conclusions are: i) a substantial amount of dark matter (from 1 to 50

complete destruction of such galaxies during strong starbursts, and ii) the
energy injected by stellar winds and type Ia supernovae into the ISM is

agreement with other available studies. The sample is corrected for
incompleteness in redshift space, using selection function in the form of a
Fermi-Dirac distribution. This is then used to estimate the local near-infrared
luminosity function of galaxies. A Schechter fit to the infrared data gives:
M$^\ast_K = -25.1 \pm 0.3$, $\alpha = -1.3\pm 0.2$ and $\phi^\ast =(1.5\pm

reduced to $\alpha=-1$, this agrees with other available estimates of the local

function when compared to previous studies. This is interpreted as due to the
presence of a population of faint but evolved (metal rich) galaxies in the
local Universe. However, it is not from the same population as the faint blue
galaxies found in the optical surveys. The characteristic magnitude
($M^\ast_K$) of the local IRLF indicates that the bright red galaxies ($M_K\sim

coincidences with the other BALs, such as C IV 1548,1550 and Si IV 1393,1403,
and by photoionization calculations showing that other lines near this
wavelength, e.g. Fe III 1123, should be much weaker than P V. The observed BAL
strengths imply that either 1) there are extreme abundance ratios such as [C/H]
>~ +1.0, [Si/H] >~ +1.8 and [P/C] >~ +2.2, or 2) at least some of the lines are
much more optically thick than they appear. I argue that the significant
presence of P V absorption indicates severe line saturation, which is disguised
in the observed (moderate-strength) BALs because the absorber does not fully
cover the continuum source(s) along our line(s) of sight. Computed optical
depths for all UV resonance lines show that the observed BALs are consistent
with solar abundances if 1) the ionization parameter is at least moderately
high, log U >~ -0.6, 2) the total hydrogen column density is log N_H(cm-2) >~
22.0, and 3) the optical depths in strong lines like C IV and O VI 1032,1038

at least an order of magnitude larger than expected from the residual

find strong correlations between the CIV/$Ly\alpha$ ratio, the equivalent width

agreement with the photoionization calculation, suggesting that the overall
ionizing continuum can well match the observed UV to soft X-ray spectrum. These
results are consistent with the assumption of isotropic ionizing continuum
shape. Our analysis suggests a small range for the ``big blue bump'' cutoff
energy for the objects in this sample, consistent with the similar results of
Laor et al. (1997) and Walter & Fink (1993) based on the continuum properties .
The mean UV-to-X-ray spectral slope is similar to the soft X-ray spectral
slope. This similarity also holds for radio-loud and radio-quiet objects
separately. This suggests that the two might be drawn from the same

whose amplitude is highly dependent on the metallicity and mass-loss rates
adopted in the models. The overluminosity with respect to the standard Mc-L
relation, that occurs in the most massive AGB stars, causes a smoothing of this
colour jump. On the other hand, we find that a transient red phase takes place
~1.5x10^8 yr after the RGB develops. We then discuss the possible reasons for
the transition of V-K colours (from ~1.5 to 3) that takes place in LMC clusters
of SWB type IV. A revision of the ages attributed to the clusters reveals that
the transition may not be as fast as originally suggested. A gradual (or
delayed) transition of the colours, as predicted by models which include the
overluminosity of the most massive AGB stars, describes better the data than
the sudden colour-jump predicted by classical models.

(z_a < 1) damped Ly-alpha systems. These observations aim at measuring the HI
column density and detect metal lines in order to investigate the metal
enrichment of the gas, as well as the presence of neutral species, molecules

FeII lines relative to MgII ones turn out to have N(HI) larger than 10^20 cm-2.
It appears that although the scatter of metallicities is as large at z_a<1 as
at high redshift, an increasing proportion of systems with metallicities ~ 30%
solar are found when going at lower redshifts. Our results suggest that
available observations may be biased against dust-rich absorbers. Further, when
all available measurements of N(HI) and [Zn/H] are considered, a clear
deficiency of systems with large N(HI) and high metallicity is apparent. We
conclude that dust extinction causes a preferential selection of QSOs with
intervening gas relatively poor in metals, dust and molecules. As a
consequence, the high end of the HI column density distribution (and hence
Omega_g, the contribution of neutral gas to the cosmological mass density) is
probably more heavily underestimated than previously thought, especially at low
redshift. Such a bias could also explain the high incidence of non-spiral
morphologies in our sample. We stress that observation of a larger sample of
low z damped Ly-alpha systems as well as surveys of damped Ly-alpha systems in
fainter QSOs would give a more representative view of the true diversity of
absorber properties and should help to probe the denser phases of the
interstellar medium in distant galaxies.

  The subject of the discussion concerns the correlation properties of galaxy
distribution in the available 3-d samples. There is a general agreement that
galaxy structures exhibit fractal properties, at least up to some scale.
However the presence of an eventual crossover towards homogenization, as well
as the exact value of the fractal dimension, are still matter of debate.
  Here we briefly summarize our point of view by discussing three main topics.
The first one is methodological, i.e. we clarify which are the correct methods
to detect the real correlations properties of the 3-d galaxy distribution.
  Then we discuss the results of the analysis of several samples in two ranges
of scales. In the first range of scale, below $100 \div 200 \hmp$, the
statistical quality of the data is rather good, and we find that galaxy
distribution has fractal properties with $D \approx2$.
  At larger distances the statistical robustness of the present data is weaker,
but, we show that there is evidence for a continuation of the fractal behavior,
without any tendency towards homogenization.

anisotropy. The crossover is influenced by the size of the particle, the
strength of the driving magnetic field, and the anisotropy. We discuss the
relevant energy barriers which have to be overcome during the switching, and
find theoretical arguments which yield the energetically favorable reversal
mechanisms for given values of the quantities above. The results are confirmed
by Monte Carlo simulations of Heisenberg and Ising models.

intrinsic geometry) of the 2- and 3-D Ising models. Such an algebraic calculus
is much simpler to deal with than working with the geometrical objects. For the

the radius of convergence of this expansion and show that it is determined by
the critical temperature. In 3-D the hopping expansion leads to the surface
representation of the Ising model in terms of surfaces with intrinsic geometry.
Based on a representation of the 3-D model as a product of 2-D models coupled

the theory of the classical r-matrix for integrable systems. In this picture
the r-matrix is related to a fourth rank tensor, named the r-tensor, on the

three tensorial indices. Being defined on the configuration space it has no
momentum dependence but is dynamical in the sense of depending on the
configuration variables. The tensorial nature of the r-matrix is used to derive
its transformation properties. The resulting transformation formula turns out
to be valid for a general r-matrix structure independently of the geometric
framework. Moreover, the entire structure of the r-matrix equation follows
directly from a simple covariant expression involving the Lax matrix and its
covariant derivative. Therefore it is argued that the geometric formulation
proposed here helps to improve the understanding of general r-matrix
structures. It is also shown how the Jacobi identity gives rise to a
