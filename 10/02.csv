perturbation of a Keplerian disc by a companion star orbiting in a plane
inclined to the disc. The perturbation induces the precession of the disc, and
thus of any jet it could drive. In some conditions the precession rate is
uniform, and as a result the disc settles into a warp mode. The tidal torque
also leads to the truncation of the disc, to the evolution of the inclination
angle (not necessarily towards alignment of the disc and orbital planes) and to
a transport of angular momentum in the disc. We note that the spectral energy
distribution of such a warped disc is different from that of a flat disc. We
conclude by listing observational effects of warps in protostellar discs.

extension of the major axis of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph)
galaxy, and in four fields along the northwest extension. Using star counts at
the expected position of the Sgr upper main-sequence within the resulting
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), we unambiguously detect Sgr stars in the
southeast over the range 10--34 degreesfrom the galaxy's center. If Sgr is
symmetric, this implies a true major-axis diameter of at least 68 degrees, or
nearly 30 kpc if all portions of Sgr are equally distant from the Sun. Star
counts parallel to the galaxy's minor-axis reveal that Sgr remains quite broad
far from its center. This suggests that the outer portions of Sgr resemble a
stream rather than an extension of the ellipsoidal inner regions of the galaxy.
The inferred V-band surface brightness (SB) profile ranges from 27.3-30.5 mag
per arcsec**2 over this radial range and exhibits a change in slope approx 20
degrees from the center of Sgr. The scale length of the outer SB profile is
17.2 degrees, compared to 4.7 degrees in the central region of Sgr. We
speculate that this break in the SB profile represents a transition from the
main body of Sgr to a more extended `Sgr stream'. By integrating the SB profile
we estimate that the absolute visual magnitude of Sgr lies in the range -13.4
to -14.6, depending on the assumed structure of Sgr; an upper limit to the
luminosity of Sgr is therefore approx 5.8x10**7 Solar Luminosities. This result
lowers the V-band M/L ratio inferred for Sgr by Ibata et al. (1997) down to
approx 10, consistent with values observed in the most luminous dSph companions
of the Milky Way.

  Svensson (Graftavallen, Sweden), June29 - July 4, 1998",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Any cold, optically-thick matter in the vicinity of an accreting black hole,
such as the accretion disk, can intercept and reprocess some fraction of the
hard X-ray continuum emission, thereby imprinting atomic features into the
observed spectrum. This process of `X-ray reflection' primarily gives rise to a
broad reflection `hump' peaking at 30keV and an iron emission line at 6.4keV.
In this review, I briefly describe the physics of this process before reviewing
the observations of these features in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and Galactic
black hole candidates (GBHCs). In some AGN, Seyfert galaxies in particular, the
iron line is found to be very broad and asymmetric. It is believed that such
lines arise from the innermost regions of the accretion disk, with
mildly-relativistic Doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts combining to
produce the line profile. Hence, such lines give us a direct observational
probe of the region within several gravitational radii of the black hole. The
complications that plague similar studies of GBHCs, such as disk ionization and
the possibly of inner disk disruption, are also addressed. I conclude with a
discussion of iron line reverberation, i.e. temporal changes of the iron line
as `echos' of large X-ray flares sweep across the accretion disk. It is shown
that interesting reverberation effects, such as a definitive signature of
extremal Kerr geometry, is within reach of high throughput spectrometers such
as Constellation-X.

dissipationless collapse is generated using GRAPE and HARP special purpose
computers. Such models are important to understand the formation of elliptical
galaxies.
  Three dynamically distinct phases of shape evolution were found, first a fast
dynamical collapse which gives rise to the radial orbit instability (ROI) and
generates at its end the maximal triaxiality of the system. Subsequently, two
phases of violent and two-body shape relaxation occur, which drive the system
first towards axisymmetry, finally to spherical symmetry (the final state,
however, is still much more concentrated than the initial model).
  In a sequence of models the influence of numerical and physical parameters,
like particle number, softening, initial virial ratio, timestep choice,
different N-body codes, are examined. We find that an improper combination of
softening and particle number can produce erroneous results. Selected models
were evolved on the secular timescale until they became spherically symmetric
again. The secular shape relaxation time scale is shown to agree very well with
the two-body relaxation time, if softening is properly taken into account for
the latter. Finally, we argue, that the intermediate phase of violent shape
relaxation after collapse is induced by strong core oscillations in the centre,
which cause potential fluctuations, dampening out the triaxiality.

C/N shows no correlation with O/H. The rate of increase of C/O is somewhat
uncertain because of uncertainty as to the appropriate UV reddening law, and
uncertainty in the metallicity dependence on grain depletions. However, the
trend of increasing C/O with O/H is clear, confirming and extending the trend
in C/O indicated previously from observations of irregular galaxies. Our data
indicate that the radial gradients in C/H across spiral galaxies are steeper
than the gradients in O/H. Comparing the data to chemical evolution models for
spiral galaxies shows that models in which the massive star yields do not vary
with metallicity predict radial C/O gradients that are much flatter than the
observed gradients. The most likely hypothesis at present is that stellar winds
in massive stars have an important effect on the yields and thus on the
evolution of carbon and oxygen abundances. C/O and N/O abundance ratios in the
outer disks of spirals determined to date are very similar to those in dwarf
irregular galaxies. This implies that the outer disks of spirals have average

experiments for discovering the non-trivial global topology of the universe. To
evaluate the CMB anisotropy in multiply-connected compact cosmological models,
one needs to compute the eigenmodes of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Using the
direct boundary element method, we numerically obtain the low-lying eigenmodes
on a compact hyperbolic 3-space called the Thurston manifold which is the
second smallest in the known compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The computed
eigenmodes are expanded in terms of eigenmodes on the unit three-dimensional
pseudosphere. We numerically find that the expansion coefficients behave as
Gaussian pseudo-random numbers for low-lying eigenmodes. The observed
gaussianity in the CMB fluctuations can partially be attributed to the Gaussian
pseudo-randomness of the expansion coefficients assuming that the Gaussian
pseudo-randomness is the universal property of the compact hyperbolic spaces.

estimating the completeness of quasar surveys. It requires that an area has
been covered by two or more, preferably different, selection techniques. We use
three suitable data sets with separate selections from: variability and
UV-excess (170 quasars); objective prism and UV-excess (141 quasars);
multicolour and X-ray ({\it ROSAT,} 19 quasars). We find that, for selection by
UV-excess, the common limit of $U-B \le -0.35 \pm -0.05$ leads to losses of
$\sim 35%$, typically missing low-luminosity $(M_{B} \gtrsim -24.5)$ quasars,
independently of redshift. Systematic incompleteness will therefore affect the
new generation of large quasar surveys that select by $U-B \le -0.35$. By
correcting for this incompleteness, we find, from the first data set ($B <
21.0$ and $z < 2.2$), that the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (LF)
is best described by joint luminosity and density evolution. When extrapolated
to $z = 0$, the LF matches that of local Seyfert galaxies better than any
previous determination. The LF shows an increase in the number of
low-luminosity quasars at low redshifts and of brighter quasars at intermediate
redshifts, relative to the LF of Boyle et al. (1990). This result is consistent
with models in which quasars fade from an initial bright phase.

pulsations in ZZ Ceti variables (DAVs). Since our understanding of turbulence
is rudimentary, we are compelled to settle for order of magnitude results. A
key feature of these interactions is that convective response times are much
shorter than pulsation periods. Thus the dynamical interactions enforce near
uniform horizontal velocity inside the convection zone. They also give rise to
a narrow shear layer in the region of convective overshoot at the top of the
radiative interior. Turbulent damping inside the convection zone is negligible
for all modes, but that in the region of convective overshoot may be
significant for a few long period modes near the red edge of the instability
strip. These conclusions are in accord with those reached earlier by Brickhill.
Our major new result concerns nonlinear damping arising from the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the aforementioned shear layer. Amplitudes of
overstable modes saturate where dissipation due to this instability balances
excitation by convective driving. This mechanism of amplitude saturation is
most effective for long period modes, and it may play an important role in
defining the red edge of the instability strip.

examples of dynamic and static systems. The contact duration used here does not
change the instantaneous nature of the hard sphere contacts, but accounts for a
reduced dissipation during ``multiparticle contacts''. Kinetic and elastic

phase separation occurs for V significantly smaller than previously reported.
In addition, for negative U, we find that a uniform state re-enters from phase
separation as the electron density is increased towards half filling. For V <

method works when the interference is present in many harmonics, as long as
they remain coherent with one another. The method can remove interference even
when the frequency changes. We apply the method to the data produced by the
Glasgow laser interferometer in 1996 and the entire series of wide lines
corresponding to the electricity supply frequency and its harmonics are
removed, leaving the spectrum clean enough to detect possible signals
previously masked by them. We also study the effects of the line removal on the
statistics of the noise in the time domain. We find that this technique seems
to reduce the level of non-Gaussian noise present in the interferometer and
therefore, it can raise the sensitivity and duty cycle of the detectors.

over a wide longitudinal momentum scale - corresponding to the early photon
emission time from the hypothetical parton system. This method provides the
needed selectivity for the early emitted photons, since the photons emitted at
later times correlate over progressively narrower momentum scales. Second, in a
similar way we argue that the existence of a hypothetic dark matter candidate,
the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), may be tested by studying HBT
correlations of cosmic gamma rays at a relatively long detection time scale -
corresponding to the very narrow spectral line of the photons emerging from
WIMP annihilations. Background photons leave no signature since they

reversal invariance and therefore allows to reach a high accuracy. Sufficient
luminosity can be obtained using a window-less storage cell placed on the axis

of the pion field caused by spontaneously generated local distortions of the
chiral order parameter. Such distortions, which may occur in the expansion of a
hot fireball created in relativistic nuclear collisions, may be influenced or
even triggered by the interaction with strong electromagnetic fields through
the axial anomaly. We suggest that semiperipheral collisions may provide the
best environment for the formation of these disoriented chiral condensates.

by the INDRA collaboration, with the Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model in
order to identify the reaction mechanism which leads to multifragmentation. We
find that QMD describes the data quite well, in the projectile/target region as
well as in the midrapidity zone where also statistical models can be and have
been employed. The agreement between QMD and data allows to use this dynamical
model to investigate the reaction in detail. We arrive at the following
observations: a) the in medium nucleon nucleon cross section is not
significantly different from the free cross section, b) even the most central
collisions have a binary character, c) most of the fragments are produced in
the central collisions and d) the simulations as well as the data show a strong
attractive in-plane flow resembling deep inelastic collisions e) at midrapidity
the results from QMD and those from statistical model calculations agree for
almost all observables with the exception of ${d^2 \sigma \over dZdE}$. This
renders it difficult to extract the reaction mechanism from midrapidity
fragments only. According to the simulations the reaction shows a very early
formation of fragments, even in central collisions, which pass through the
reaction zone without being destroyed. The final transverse momentum of the
fragments is very close to the initial one and due to the Fermi motion. A
heating up of the systems is not observed and hence a thermal origin of the
spectra cannot be confirmed.

1p1h and 2p2h states we propose a new method of selecting the most important
2p2h states responsible for fragmentation effects. In this way the
dimensionality of the problem is reduced, such that the computation becomes
feasible and the spreading of the strength is realistic, as verified by some
tests of convergence. Calculations in $^{208}$Pb show that due to sizable
mixing effects only about 50% of the total isoscalar giant dipole resonance
(ISGDR) $3\hbar\omega$ strength is located in the energy region between 20 and
25 MeV. This is the energy region which currently is available in experiment.
Even above 30 MeV we find about 10% of the total strength. This indicates that
the current experimantal evaluations of the ISGDR centroid energy may
significantly underestimate its value.

approximately constant, and that this is true to a lesser extent for the
c-quark. These observations provide the basis for a study of the leptonic and
semileptonic decays of heavy pseudoscalar mesons using a ``heavy-quark'' limit
of the DSEs. When exact, this limit reduces the number of independent form
factors. Semileptonic decays with light mesons in the final state are also
accessible because the DSEs provide a description of light-quark propagation
characteristics and light-meson structure. A description of B-meson decays is
straightforward, however, the study of decays involving the D-meson indicates
that c-quark mass-corrections are quantitatively important.

a wide-bandgap semiconductor, and the surface energy is significantly higher
than for other semiconductors. We explain these features in terms of the small
lattice constant of GaN and the unique bond strength of nitrogen molecules.
