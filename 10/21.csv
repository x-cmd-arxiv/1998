convincing evidence for saturation in parts of the troughs. This supports our

on claims for very high metallicity in BAL flows. Due to the importance of BAL
saturation we also discuss its evidence in other objects. In PG~0946+301 large

clouds, many of which are self-gravitating and form stars. To understand how
these clouds' evolution may depend on their level of turbulence, mean
magnetization, and degree of self-gravity, we perform a survey of direct
numerical MHD simulations in 2.5 dimensions. Two of our independent survey
parameters allow us to model clouds which either meet or fail conditions for
magneto-Jeans stability and magnetic criticality. Our third survey parameter
allows us to initiate turbulence of either sub- or super-Alfv\'enic amplitude.
We evaluate the times for each cloud model to become gravitationally bound, and
measure each model's kinetic energy loss over the fluid flow crossing time. We
compare the evolution of density and magnetic field structural morphology, and
quantify the differences in the density contrast generated by internal
stresses, for models of differing mean magnetization. We find that the values
of (c_s/v_A)^2 and L/L_Jeans, but not the initial Mach number v/c_s, determine
the time for cloud gravitational binding and collapse. We find, contrary to
some previous expectations, less than a factor of two difference between
turbulent decay times for models with varying magnetic field strength. In all
models, we find turbulent amplification in the magnetic field strength, with
the turbulent magnetic energy between 25-60% of the turbulent kinetic energy
after one flow crossing time. We find that for non-self-gravitating stages of
evolution, the mass-averaged density contrast magnitudes <log(\rho/\bar\rho)>
are in the range 0.2-0.5; we note that only the more strongly-magnetized models
appear consistent with estimates of clump/interclump density contrasts inferred
in Galactic GMCs.

made in 1973 by instruments placed on the Moon during the Apollo 17 mission,
but the total daytime abundance is unknown due to instrument saturation
effects; thus, until we are able to return to the Moon for improved direct
measurements, we must use remote sensing to establish the daytime abundance. In
this paper, we present a complete analysis of the potential for measuring argon
in the lunar atmosphere via emission-line or absorption-line observations. We
come to the surprising conclusion that the lower limit established by the in
situ lunar argon measurements implies that any absorption-line measurement of
argon in the lower, dayside lunar atmosphere requires analysis in the
optically-thick regime. In light of this result, we present the results of our
EUVS sounding rocket observations of the lunar occultation of Spica, which
provide a new upper limit on the abundance of argon in the daytime lunar
atmosphere. We also re-analyze a recently reported weak detection of lunar
atmospheric Ar I 1048 in emission by the ORFEUS satellite, and show that those
data are inconsistent with the emission being due to argon over a wide range of
temperatures. This result is primarily due to our use of a more complete curve
of growth analysis, and improved values for the argon fluorescent emission
rates from radiation and solar wind interactions. We find that the detection
reported by ORFEUS would imply an argon surface density significantly greater
than the total surface density of the lunar atmosphere for argon accommodated
to typical daytime surface temperatures (~400 K), and also is inconsistent with
a high-density transient event. We conclude that the reported argon detection
is untenable.

acts in the direction -\hat V, and arises from the gravitational attraction
between the perturber and its wake in the ambient medium. For supersonic motion
(M=V/c_s>1), the enhanced-density wake is confined to the Mach cone trailing
the perturber; for subsonic motion (M<1), the wake is confined to a sphere of
radius c_s t centered a distance V t behind the perturber. Inside the wake,
surfaces of constant density are hyperboloids or oblate spheroids for
supersonic or subsonic perturbers, respectively, with the density maximal
nearest the perturber. The dynamical drag force has the form F_df= - I 4\pi (G

conclude that the double nuclei have their own gas disks (r ~ 100 pc). They are
counterrotating with respect to each other and embedded in the outer gas disk
(r ~ 1 kpc) rotating around the dynamical center of the system. The masses of
each nucleus are M_dyn > 2* 10^9 M_sun based on the CO kinematics. Although
there is no evidence of an old stellar population in the optical or near
infrared spectroscopy of the nuclei (probably due to the much brighter young
population), it seems likely that these nuclei were 'seeded' from the
pre-merger nuclei in view of their counterrotating gas kinematics. The gas
disks probably constitute a significant fraction (~ 50 %) of the mass in each
nucleus. The CO and continuum brightness temperatures imply that the nuclear
gas disks have high area filling factors (~ 0.5-1) and have extremely high
visual extinctions (Av ~ 1000 mag). The molecular gas must be hot (>= 40 K) and
dense (>= 10^4-5 cm^-3), given the large mass and small scale-height of the

deg, with an amplitude of up to 2 mas. This correlation is stronger than
expected based on the analysis of the Hipparcos catalog. We predict the
parallaxes of individual cluster members, pi_pm, from their Hipparcos proper
motions, assuming that all cluster members have the same space velocity. We
compare pi_pm with their Hipparcos parallaxes, pi_Hip, and find that there are
significant spatial correlations in pi_Hip. We derive a distance modulus to the
Pleiades of 5.58 +- 0.18 mag using the radial-velocity gradient method. This
value, agrees very well with the distance modulus of 5.60 +- 0.04 mag
determined using the main-sequence fitting technique, compared with the value
of 5.33 +- 0.06 inferred from the average of the Hipparcos parallaxes of the
Pleiades members. We show that the difference between the main-sequence fitting
distance and the Hipparcos parallax distance can arise from spatially
correlated errors in the Hipparcos parallaxes of individual Pleiades members.
Although the Hipparcos parallax errors towards the Hyades are spatially
correlated in a manner similar to those of the Pleiades, the center of the
Hyades is located on a node of this spatial structure. Therefore, the parallax
errors cancel out when the average distance is estimated, leading to a mean
Hyades distance modulus that agrees with the pre-Hipparcos value. We speculate
that these spatial correlations are also responsible for the discrepant
distances that are inferred using the mean Hipparcos parallaxes to some open
clusters. Finally, we note that our conclusions are based on a purely geometric

chemical potential is increased from the bottom to the top of a realistic band
for most cuprates. It allows for mixed-symmetry paired state at temperatures
below T_c, but never at T_c on a square lattice. Inclusion of the interlayer
pair-tunneling into the effective pairing potential leads to highly non-trivial
k-space structures, such as pronounced maxima along the Fermi line not seen in
the absence of interlayer pair-tunneling.

the irreversible Diffusion Limited Aggregation model (DLA) in contact with a
heat bath. Particles release latent heat when aggregating, while singly
connected cluster members can absorb heat and evaporate. The heat bath is
initially empty, hence we observe the flow of entropy from the aggregating gas
of particles into the heat bath, which is being populated by diffusing heat
tokens. Before the population of the heat bath stabilizes, the cluster
morphology (quantified by the fractal dimension) is similar to a standard DLA
cluster. The cluster then gradually anneals, becoming more tenuous, until
reaching configurational equilibrium when the cluster morphology resembles a
quenched branched random polymer. As the microscopic dynamics is invertible, we
can reverse the evolution, observe the inverse flow of heat and entropy, and
recover the initial condition. This simple system provides an explicit example
of how macroscopic dissipation and self-organization can result from an
underlying microscopically reversible dynamics.

previously by us. We treat Lee and Wen's edge action of a half-filled Landau
level within the framework of bosonization theory, and show that the momentum
occupation numbers are determined by a product of two Green's functions, one
charged and one neutral. In the bulk region ($k<0$) we find a linear occupation
profile, $n_k \propto A+Bk$, while in the tail region ($k>0$) it is
exponentially decaying over the range $k\sim\Ln$, the momentum cutoff for
neutral mode. We find a good fit with the numerical results for occupation
numbers.

observer coming from a given source is associated with Fermat's Principle of
Least Time which yields paths of extremal time. We here investigate a related
but different problem. We consider an observer receiving light from an extended
source that has propagated in an arbitrary gravitational field. It is assumed
from the start that the propagation is along null geodesics. Each point of the
extended source is sending out a light-cones worth of null rays and the
question arises which null rays from the source arrive first at the observer.
Stated in an a different fashion, a pulse of light comes from the source with a
wave-front as the leading edge, which rays are associated with that leading
edge. In vacuum flat-space we have, from Huygen's principle, that the rays
normal to the source constitute the leading edge and hence arrive first at an
observer. We here investigate this issue in the presence of a gravitational
field. Though it is not obvious, since the rays bend and are focused by the
gravitational field and could even cross, in fact it is the normal rays that
arrive earliest. We give two proofs both involving the extemization of the time
of arrival, one based on an idea of Schrodinger for the derivation of
gravitational frequency shifts and the other based on V.I. Arnold's theory of
generating families.

derivation leads to very general relations between the form factors that
parametrize the hadronic matrix elements. We investigate to what extent these
form factor relations remain a good approximation, beyond the Quark Model.
  In heavy-to-light pseudoscalar-to-vector meson transitions, a simple argument
shows that the V-A structure of the weak interaction leads to a strong
suppression of the helicity h=+1 amplitude - an effect that has been confirmed
experimentally by the CLEO Collaboration, with a full angular analysis of the B
-> K* J/psi decay. We show that the theoretical predictions, in terms of the
hadronic form factors, can accommodate the suppression of the h=+1 amplitude,
only if the Quark Model relations are verified. Moreover, the form factor
relations also allow us to predict the ratio of the two remaining helicity
amplitudes, with h=0 and h=-1; here too, there is excellent agreement with the
CLEO data for the B -> K* J/psi decay. In the future, similar experimental
tests can be carried out, with a few advantages, using the semileptonic decay B
-> rho l- nu_l.
  The Quark Model relations can also be tested against the predictions for the
hadronic form factors, from the more powerful theoretical methods of Lattice
QCD and Light Cone Sum-Rules. The excellent agreement points once again to the
validity of the form factor relations, beyond the Quark Model framework where
they were derived.

spin-1/2 hadrons. The additional structure functions are associated with the
tensor structure of the spin-1 hadron, and they could be measured by quadrupole
spin asymmetries. For example, the structure functions exist for ""intermediate""
polarization although their contributions vanish in the longitudinal and
transverse polarization reactions. We show a number of spin asymmetries for
extracting the polarized structure functions. The proton-deuteron reaction may
be realized in the RHIC-Spin project and other future ones, and it could be a

necessarily generates at one-loop a scalar and gaugino mass as a consequence of
the super-Weyl anomaly. We study a scenario in which this contribution
dominates. We consider the Standard Model particles to be localized on a
(3+1)-dimensional subspace or ``3-brane'' of a higher dimensional spacetime,
while supersymmetry breaking occurs off the 3-brane, either in the bulk or on
another 3-brane. At least one extra dimension is assumed to be compactified
roughly one to two orders of magnitude below the four-dimensional Planck scale.
This framework is phenomenologically very attractive; it introduces new
possibilities for solving the supersymmetric flavor problem, the gaugino mass
problem, the supersymmetric CP problem, and the mu-problem. Furthermore, the
compactification scale can be consistent with a unification of gauge and
gravitational couplings. We demonstrate these claims in a four-dimensional
effective theory below the compactification scale that incorporates the
relevant features of the underlying higher dimensional theory and the
contribution of the super-Weyl anomaly. Naturalness constraints follow not only
from symmetries but also from the higher dimensional origins of the theory. We
also introduce additional bulk contributions to the MSSM soft masses. This
scenario is very predictive: the gaugino masses, squark masses, and $A$ terms
are given in terms of MSSM renormalization group functions.

analysis of the vacuum structure is provided by deriving the effective quantum

of the zero modes of the adjoint scalars and fermions is crucial for probing
