an inwards spiraling starburst in all three near-IR bands. NGC 2992 shows

dust obscuration becomes significantly less pronounced at longer wavelengths,
revealing the true geometry of the core regions. The observed structures may
help to elucidate fueling mechanisms for the central engine, as well as
providing insight into the unification paradigms. The results are tempered with
the discovery of AOB-related artifacts in the central arcsec of observed AGN

galaxies between redshifts z ~ 0.1 - 5 is currently in progress. The first
results from observations with the bolometer array SCUBA on the JCMT suggest a
trend of increasing submillimetre luminosity with redshift out to z ~ 4.
Assuming the continuum emission at 850um is dominated by thermal radiation from
dust heated by young, massive stars, the straightforward interpretation of
these data implies that the host galaxies of powerful radio sources, presumably
ellipticals or their progenitors, exhibit increased star formation activity
with increasing redshift. However a severe bias may distort the true picture
since only a subset of 30 galaxies have been observed, which represent the most
luminous radio sources (P_(151 MHz) > 10^27.5 W Hz^-1 sr^-1), whilst the
complete sample covers ~4 decades in radio power (10^25 - 10^29 W Hz^-1 sr^-1).
This on-going observational programme continues to improve coverage of the
radio power-redshift plane in an attempt to remove this potential bias towards
higher AGN activity and hence understand more fully the relationship between
high-z AGN, their level of starformation, and the evolutionary status of their
host galaxies.

loud QSOs and BL Lacs. The remaining sources are galaxies, typically radio
galaxies isolated or in cluster. Thanks to the low flux limits in the radio and
in the X-ray band and the large area of sky covered by the survey, we intend to
derive a new complete and unbiased sample of BL Lacs which will contain both
``RBL'' and ``XBL'' type objects. In this way, the apparent dichotomy resulting
from the current samples of BL Lacs will be directly analyzed in a unique
sample. Moreover, the high number of BL Lacs expected in the REX sample (about
200) will allow an accurate estimate of their statistical properties. To date,
we have discovered 15 new BL Lacs and 11 BL Lac candidates with optical
properties intermediate between those of a typical elliptical galaxy and those
of a typical BL Lac object. These objects could harbour weak sources of
non-thermal continuum in their nuclei and, if confirmed, they could represent
the faint tail of the BL Lac population. The existence of such ``weak'' BL Lacs
is matter of discussion in recent literature and could lead to a re-assessment
of the defining criteria of a BL Lac and, consequently, to a revision of their
cosmological and statistical properties.

discovery in the late sixties. The BATSE detector on the COMPTON-GRO satellite
has been detecting one burst per day for the last six years. Its findings have
revolutionized our ideas about the nature of these objects. They have shown
that GRBs are at cosmological distances. This idea was accepted with
difficulties at first. The recent discovery of an X-ray afterglow by the
Italian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX has led to a detection of high red-shift
absorption lines in the optical afterglow of GRB970508 and in several other
bursts and to the identification of host galaxies to others. This has confirmed
the cosmological origin. Cosmological GRBs release $\sim 10^{51}-10^{53}$ergs
in a few seconds making them the most (electromagnetically) luminous objects in
the Universe. The simplest, most conventional, and practically inevitable,
interpretation of these observations is that GRBs result from the conversion of
the kinetic energy of ultra-relativistic particles or possibly the
electromagnetic energy of a Poynting flux to radiation in an optically thin
region. This generic ""fireball"" model has also been confirmed by the afterglow
observations. The ""inner engine"" that accelerates the relativistic flow is
hidden from direct observations. Consequently it is difficult to infer its
structure directly from current observations. Recent studies show, however,
that this ``inner engine'' is responsible for the complicated temporal
structure observed in GRBs. This temporal structure and energy considerations
indicates that the ``inner engine'' is associated with the formation of a
compact object - most likely a black hole.

depend on the projected matter density between today and redshift $z \sim

obtained by averaging over quadratic combinations of the derivatives of CMB
field. We test the method using simulations and show that it can successfully
recover projected density profile of a cluster of galaxies if there are
measurable anisotropies on scales smaller than the characteristic cluster size.
In the absence of sufficient small scale power the reconstructed maps have low
signal to noise on individual structures, but can give a positive detection of
the power spectrum or when cross correlated with other maps of large scale
structure. We develop an analytic method to reconstruct the power spectrum
including the effects of noise and beam smoothing. Tests with Monte Carlo
simulations show that we can recover the input power spectrum both on large and
small scales, provided that we use maps with sufficiently low noise and high
angular resolution.

most generic inflationary matter contents, and 3) it is a theory of the
chaotic-inflation type. That type of inflation is the most widely accepted
today, as it demands the least fine-tuning of initial conditions. It is also
shown how, by dropping the usual simplification of minimal coupling between
matter and geometry, the null energy condition can be violated and the relevant
singularity theorems circumvented.

We begin by obtaining the effective in-medium Dirac equation in real time which
is fully renormalized and causal and leads to the initial value problem. For a
heavy scalar we find the novel result that the decay of the scalar into fermion
pairs in the medium leads to damping of the fermionic excitations and their
in-medium propagation as quasiparticles. That is, the fermions acquire a width
due to the decay of the heavier scalar in the medium. We find the damping rate
to lowest order in the Yukawa coupling for arbitrary values of scalar and
fermion masses, temperature and fermion momentum. An all-order expression for
the damping rate in terms of the exact quasiparticle wave functions is
established. A kinetic Boltzmann approach to the relaxation of the fermionic
distribution function confirms the damping of fermionic excitations as a
consequence of the induced decay of heavy scalars in the medium. A
linearization of the Boltzmann equation near equilibrium clearly displays the
relationship between the damping rate of fermionic mean fields and the fermion
interaction rate to lowest order in the Yukawa coupling directly in real time.

symmetry of string effective action in cosmological backgrounds interchanging

(""pre-big-bang"") in which two duality related branches, an inflationary branch
and a decelerated branch are smoothly joined into one non-singular cosmology.
The use of scale factor duality in the analysis of the higher derivative
corrections to the effective action, and consequences for the nature of exit
transition, between the inflationary and decelerated branches, are outlined. A
new duality symmetry is obeyed by the lowest order equations for inhomogeneity
perturbations which always exist on top of the homogeneous and isotropic
background. In some cases it corresponds to a time dependent version of
S-duality, interchanging weak and strong coupling and electric and magnetic
degrees of freedom, and in most cases it corresponds to a time dependent
mixture of both S-, and T-duality.
  The energy spectra obtained by using the new symmetry reproduce known results
of produced particle spectra, and can provide a useful lower bound on particle
production when our knowledge of the detailed dynamical history of the
background is approximate or incomplete.

simple) matrix Lie superalgebra, i.e., a Lie subsuperalgebra in GL(V). Under
the classical invariant theory for G we mean the description of G-invariant
elements of the tensor algebra of V.
  We give such description for GL(V), SL(V) and OSP(V) and their ``odd''
analogs: Q(V), SQ(V); Pe(V) and SPe(V).

Lett","Phys.Rev.Lett.82:1096-1100,1999","10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.1096","WM-98-117","nucl-ex",,"  We have measured the parity-violating electroweak asymmetry in the elastic
scattering of polarized electrons from the proton. The kinematic point
(theta_lab = 12.3 degrees and Q^2=0.48 (GeV/c)^2) is chosen to provide
sensitivity, at a level that is of theoretical interest, to the strange
electric form factor G_E^s. The result, A=-14.5 +- 2.2 ppm, is consistent with
the electroweak Standard Model and no additional contributions from strange
quarks. In particular, the measurement implies G_E^s + 0.39G_M^s = 0.023 +-
0.034 (stat) +- 0.022 (syst) +- 0.026 (delta G_E^n), where the last uncertainty
arises from the estimated uncertainty in the neutron electric form factor.

ordinary nuclei and nuclear matter to incorporate strangeness in nuclear
structure. Central object is a chiral effective Lagrangian involving the baryon
octet, the Goldstone boson octet, the vector meson octet and a light scalar
singlet. According to the rules of effective field theory, we include all
interaction terms (up to a given order of truncation) that are consistent with
the underlying symmetries of QCD. We develop a mean-field approximation and
study nuclear matter as a simple model for multi-strange systems. A D-type
Yukawa coupling between baryons and vector mesons leads to lambda-sigma^0
flavor mixing in the nuclear medium. We study flavor oscillations in the
nuclear matter ground state which are closely related to the phenomenon of
neutrino oscillations.
