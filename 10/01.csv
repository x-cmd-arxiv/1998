candidates and the status of theoretical modeling of these properties. Like
spectral X-ray properties, which has so far attracted most of the attention,
the temporal properties, such as power spectral density, hard X-ray time lags,
and coherence functions, contain information on some of the same physical
properties of inverse Comptonization processes, which are generally believed to
be responsible for producing hard X-ray emission in black hole candidates. In
addition, the temporal properties add new information about the size of the
Comptonizing region and perhaps its density structure. Therefore, the spectral
and temporal properties taken together may help break the degeneracy, intrinsic
to most spectral studies, in determining the temperature and optical depth of
hot electrons. Moreover, significant insights might be gained into the dynamics
of mass accretion in black hole candidates from the inferred density structure
of accreted gas (from the temporal properties). Unfortunately, until very
recently little has been done to {\it quantitatively} model the observed
temporal properties of black hole candidates. I will discuss the recently
proposed models, which have been formulated in the context of thermal
Comptonization, and compare them to the data. Emphasis will be made on
simultaneous studies of the observed spectral and temporal properties, the
ultimate approach to studying X-ray production mechanisms in Galactic black
holes.

well-modelled in terms of simple white dwarf (WD) atmospheres, especially at
wavelengths shortward of Lyman alpha. The continuum flux changes by a factor of
2 near the Lyman limit as a function of orbital phase; the peak fluxes are
observed near magnetic phase 0.6 when the accreting pole of the WD is most
clearly visible. The spectrum of the hotspot can be modelled in terms of a 100
000 K WD atmosphere covering 2% of the WD surface. The high time resolution of
the HUT data allows an analysis of the short term variability and shows the UV

rapid variability is shown to be inconsistent with the clumpy accretion model
proposed to account for the soft X-ray excess in polars. We see an increase in
narrow line emission during these flares when the heated face of the secondary
is in view. The He II narrow line flux is partially eclipsed at secondary
conjunction, implying that the inclination of the system is greater than 45
degrees. We also present results from models of the heated face of the

disc heating and thickening resulting from the accretion process by a factor of
about 2-3. We find that the heating and thickening of the disc differ for
satellites on prograde and retrograde orbits. The former tend to heat the
stellar disc while the latter primarily produce a coherent tilt. Thus, disc
galaxies may accrete quite massive satellites without destroying the disc,
particularly, if the orbits are retrograde. We also find that a massive bulge
may play a role in reducing these effects. We have quantified the importance of
the responsiveness of the halo by replacing it by a rigid potentia l in several
simulations. In these cases, the increase of the vertical scale length is
larger by a factor of $1.5-2$, indicating that a self-consistent treatment is
essential to get realistic results. A frequent by-product of the accretion
process is the formation of weak stellar warps and asymmetric discs. Finally,
we have checked how well Chandrasekhar's dynamical friction formula reproduces
the sinking rates in several of our experiments. We find that it works well

constraints from the galaxy cluster mass function with Croft et al.'s recent
measurement of the mass power spectrum, P(k), from \lya forest data. The key
assumption of the method is that cosmic structure formed by gravitational
instability from Gaussian primordial fluctuations. For a specified value of
\Omega_0, matching the observed cluster mass function then fixes the value of
\sigma_8, the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in 8\hmpc spheres, and it thus
determines the normalization of P(k) at z=0. The value of \Omega_0 also
determines the ratio of P(k) at z=0 to P(k) at z=2.5, the central redshift of
the \lya forest data; the ratio is different for an open universe (\Lambda=0)
or a flat universe. Because the \lya forest measurement only reaches comoving
scales 2\pi/k ~ 15-20\hmpc, the derived value of \Omega_0 depends on the value
of the power spectrum shape parameter \Gamma, which determines the relative
contribution of larger scale modes to \sigma_8. Adopting \Gamma=0.2, a value
favored by galaxy clustering data, we find \Omega_0 = 0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.10} for
an open universe and \Omega_0=0.34^{+0.13}_{-0.09} for a flat universe (1\sigma
errors, not including the uncertainty in cluster normalization).
Cluster-normalized models with \Omega_0=1 predict too low an amplitude for P(k)
at z=2.5, while models with \Omega_0=0.1 predict too high an amplitude. The
more general best fit parameter combination is approximately \Omega_0 +
0.2\Lambda_0 = 0.46 + 1.3(\Gamma-0.2). Analysis of larger, existing samples of
QSO spectra could greatly improve the measurement of P(k) from the \lya forest,
allowing a determination of \Omega_0 by this method with a precision of ~15%,

optical confines of the system, the brightest (Lx ~ 9x10e38 erg/s), lying to
the southern edge of NGC7793. This source, also observed to be variable, is
seen now, not to be associated with a z=0.071 redshift QSO, as was previously
thought. A number of the other sources within the NGC7793 disc are likely to be
due to X-ray binaries, supernova remnants or superbubbles within the galaxy
itself. Other sources may be associated with background AGN. In addition to the
point source emission, rather uniform unresolved emission is detected in and
around NGC7793 extending to a radius of perhaps 4 kpc. This emission is likely
to be contaminated to some degree by unresolved point sources, as its
temperature (kT~1 keV) is rather hotter than is seen for the diffuse gas
components in other nearby spiral galaxies. Comparing the X-ray properties of
NGC7793 with those of the remaining Sculptor group members, suggests that it
may, in terms of activity, lie somewhere between its quiescent and starburst

of equations for surface flow of granular mixtures. We show that the stable
solution of the system is a segregation solution due to size (large grains tend

taking place for mixtures of large-cubic grains and small-rounded grains. The
large-cubic grains tend to size-segregate at the bottom of the pile, while at
the same time, they tend to shape-segregate near the pouring point. Thus, the

interlayer-coherent phase it is shown that the bilayer QH state becomes stabler
as the interlayer density difference becomes larger.

of the temperature dependencies of the derivatives {\partial R}/{\partial H}

the actions bear on security. There is a pressing need for organizations to
declare their security policies, even informal statements would be better than
the current practice. But, formal policy statements are preferable to support
(1) reasoning about policies, e.g., for consistency and completeness, (2)
automated enforcement of the policy, e.g., using wrappers around legacy systems
or after the fact with an intrusion detection system, and (3) other formal
manipulation of policies, e.g., the composition of policies. We present LaSCO,
the Language for Security Constraints on Objects, in which a policy consists of
two parts: the domain (assumptions about the system) and the requirement (what
is allowed assuming the domain is satisfied). Thus policies defined in LaSCO
have the appearance of conditional access control statements. LaSCO policies
are specified as expressions in logic and as directed graphs, giving a visual
view of policy. LaSCO has a simple semantics in first order logic (which we
provide), thus permitting policies we write, even for complex policies, to be
very perspicuous. LaSCO has syntax to express many of the situations we have
found to be useful on policies or, more interesting, the composition of
policies. LaSCO has an object-oriented structure, permitting it to be useful to
describe policies on the objects and methods of an application written in an
object-oriented language, in addition to the traditional policies on operating
system objects. A LaSCO specification can be automatically translated into
executable code that checks an invocation of a program with respect to a
policy. The implementation of LaSCO is in Java, and generates wrappers to check
Java programs with respect to a policy.

The late time evolution turns to be determined by the singularities in the
complex plane (one-particle poles, two- and multi- particle cuts, Landau cuts
for non-zero initial temperature). In hot scalar electrodynamics, we solve the
real time evolution of field condensates with soft length scales \sim
k^{-1}>(eT)^{-1}. Transverse gauge invariant condensates relax as 1/t^2 to
amplitudes determined by the quasiparticle poles. We rederive the HTL action
using the non-equilibrium field theory techniques.In the nonlinear regime (for
large initial energy densities) we analyze the dynamics of dissipation and
relaxation in scalar theory after linear unstabilities are shut-off by the
quantum back-reaction. A new time scale emerges that separates the linear from
the non-linear regimes. This scale is non-perturbative in the coupling and
initial amplitude. A combination of numerical analysis and the implementation
of a dynamical renormalization group resummation via multi-time scale analysis
reveals the presence of unstable bands in the nonlinear regime. These are
associated with power law growth of quantum fluctuations, that result in power
law relaxation and dissipation with {\bf non-universal and non-perturbative
dynamical anomalous exponents.

Drawing on our recent work, we investigate the two simplest affine Toda
theories for which this is an issue - a2(1) and a2(2). By investigating the
S-matrices of these theories before RSOS restriction, we show that quantum Toda
theory, (with or without RSOS restriction), indeed has some fundamental
problems, but that these problems are of two different sorts. For a2(1), the
scattering of solitons and breathers is flawed in both classical and quantum
theories, and RSOS restriction cannot solve this problem. For a2(2) however,
while there are no problems with breather-soliton scattering there are instead
difficulties with soliton-excited soliton scattering in the unrestricted
theory. After RSOS restriction, the problems with kink-excited kink may be
cured or may remain, depending in part on the choice of gradation, as we found
in [12]. We comment on the importance of regradations, and also on the survival
of R-matrix unitarity and the S-matrix bootstrap in these circumstances.

this sort of result is known to positive characteristic. In this note, we
analyze the subgroups of the torsion points of simple commutative algebraic
groups over finite fields that can be constructed by such difference equations.
Our results are reasonably complete modulo some well-known conjectures in
Number Theory. In one case, we need the $p$-adic version of the four

  We recover part of a theorem of Boxall on the intersection of varieties with
the group of $m$-power torsion points, but in general this theorem does not
follow from the model-theoretic analysis, because there may be no field
automorphism $\sigma$ so that the $m$-power torsion group is contained in a
modular group definable with $\sigma$. On the other hand, some of the groups
defined by modular difference equations are much larger than the group of
$m$-power torsion points, so our results are stronger in another direction. In
some ways, the model theoretic approach extends the approach of Bogomolov and
the original one of Lang.

generalized Cartan matrix) Kac-Moody algebras recently developed by V. A.
Gritsenko and the author. It is closely related with and strongly uses results
of R. Borcherds. This theory should generalize well-known Theories of finite
Kac-Moody algebras (i. e. classical semisimple Lie algebras corresponding to
positive generalized Cartan matrices) and affine Kac-Moody algebras
(corresponding to semi-positive generalized Cartan matrices).
  Main features of the Theory of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras are: One should
consider generalized Kac-Moody algebras introduced by Borcherds. Denominator
function should be an automorphic form on IV type Hermitian symmetric domain
(first example of this type related with Leech lattice was found by Borcherds).
The Kac-Moody algebra is graded by an integral hyperbolic lattice $S$. Weyl
group acts in the hyperbolic space related with $S$ and has a fundamental
polyhedron $\Cal M$ of finite (or almost finite) volume and a lattice Weyl
vector.
  There are results and conjectures which permit (in principle) to get a
``finite'' list of all possible Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras. Thus, this
theory looks very similar to Theories of finite and affine Kac-Moody algebras
but is much more complicated. There were obtained some classification results
on Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras and many of them were constructed.

calculate the coalescence probabilities and invariant momentum spectra for

hydrodynamically motivated parametrization for the source at freeze-out which
implements rapid collective expansion of the collision zone formed in heavy ion
collisions. We find that the coalescence process is governed by the same
lengths of homogeneity which can be extracted from HBT interferometry. They
appear in the absolute cluster yield via an effective volume factor as well as
in a quantum mechanical correction factor which accounts for the internal
structure of the deuteron cluster. Our analysis provides a new interpretation
for the parameters in the popular phenomenological coalescence model and for
the effective overlap volume in Hagedorn's model for cluster production in pp
collisions. Using source parameters extracted from a recent HBT analysis of
two-pion correlations, we successfully describe deuteron and antideuteron
production data from Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS as measured by the NA44
and NA52 collaborations. We also confirm the recent finding by Polleri et al.
that the different measured slopes of nucleon and deuteron transverse mass
spectra require a transverse density profile of the source which is closer to a
box than to a Gaussian shape.

magnetic field is revised, and applied to an ionospheric turbulence case. The
assumptions made in the conventional theory of resonance broadening have, in
the past, led to replacing the frequency $\omega$ by
$\omega+ik_{\perp}^{2}D^{*}$ in the resonant part of the linear dielectric
function to obtain the nonlinear dielectric function. Where $D^{*}$ is an
anomalous diffusion coefficient due solely to wave scattering of the particle
orbits. We show that in general these assumptions are not valid, and
consequently the straightforward substitution of frequencies is not legitimate.
We remedy these problems and derive expressions for the time-dependent
components of the diffusion tensor. The improved resonance broadening theory is
developed in the context of an ionospheric problem, namely that of the
Farley-Buneman turbulence in the auroral E-region. A kinetic description of the
electrons is used. A general expression for the nonlinear dielectric function
is derived in the special case where no parallel electric field is present, and
the differences with the conventional dispersion relation are discussed.

In the present paper we intend to clarify the different steps that the auroral
$E$-region plasma has to undergo before reaching a steady state. The
mode-coupling calculation, for Farley-Buneman turbulence, is developed in order
to place it in perspective and to estimate its magnitude relative to the
anomalous effects which arise through the nonlinear wave-particle interaction.
This nonlinear effect, known as nonlinear ``Landau damping'' is due to the
coupling of waves which produces other waves which in turn lose energy to the
bulk of the particles by Landau damping. This leads to a decay of the wave
energy and consequently a heating of the plasma. An equation governing the
evolution of the field spectrum is derived and a physical interpration for each
of its terms is provided.

in Fig. 1, in the implementation of this procedure, by Bouwmeester et al., an
input quantum state is `disembodied' into quantum and classical components, as
in the original protocol. However, in contrast to the original scheme,
Bouwmeester et al.'s procedure necessarily destroys the state at Bob's
receiving terminal, so a `teleported' state can never emerge as a freely
propagating state for subsequent examination or exploitation. In fact,
teleportation is achieved only as a postdiction.
