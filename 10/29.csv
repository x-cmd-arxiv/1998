This limit is inconsistent with the blue continuum being primarily scattered

the blue continuum to scattered light from an active nucleus that is hidden
from direct view. Essentially all of the data pertaining to the blue continuum
along the radio source-the ``blue lobes''-indicate that they are regions of
recent star formation that may have been induced by an interaction between the
radio source and the cool ($<10^4$ K), surrounding gas. We compare the

  The consequences for the magnetic field evolution and dynamics of dense

Alfven waves under these conditions. A linear analysis yields a dispersion
relation valid for frequencies below the neutral collision frequencies of the

r-mode instability might be responsible for stalling the neutron-star spin-up
in strongly accreting, Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). We show that if this
does occur, then there are two possibilities for the resulting neutron-star
evolution:
  If the r-mode damping is a decreasing function of temperature, then the star
undergoes a cyclic evolution: (i) accretional spin-up triggers the instability
near the observed maximum spin rate; (ii) the r-modes become highly excited
through gravitational-radiation reaction, and in a fraction of a year they
viscously heat the star; (iii) r-mode gravitational-radiation reaction then
spins the star down in a fraction of a year to some limiting rotational
frequency; (iv) the r-mode instability shuts off; (v) the neutron star slowly
cools and is spun up by accretion, until it once again reaches the instability
point, closing the cycle. The shortness of the epoch of r-mode activity makes
it unlikely that r-modes are currently excited in the neutron star of any
galactic LMXBs. Nevertheless, this cyclic evolution could be responsible for
keeping the rotational frequencies within the observed LMXB frequency range.
  If, on the other hand, the r-mode damping is temperature independent, then a
steady state with constant angular velocity and $T_{\rm core}\simeq 4\times
10^8$K is reached, in which r-mode viscous heating is balanced by neutrino
cooling and accretional spin-up torque is balanced by
gravitational-radiation-reaction spin-down torque. In this case the neutron
stars in LMXBs could be potential sources of periodic gravitational waves,
detectable by enhanced LIGO interferometers.

of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC3109, located in the outskirts of the Local
Group. The photometry allows us to study the stellar populations present inside
and outside the disk of this galaxy. From the VI color-magnitude diagram we
infer metallicities and ages for the stellar populations in the main body and
in the halo of NGC3109. The stars in the disk of this galaxy have a wide
variety of ages, including very young stars with approximately 10^7 yr. Our
main result is to establish the presence of a halo consisting of population II
stars, extending out to about 4.5 arcmin (or 1.8 kpc) above and below the plane
of this galaxy. For these old stars we derive an age of > 10 Gyr and a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.8 +/- 0.2. We construct a deep luminosity function,
obtaining an accurate distance modulus (m-M)_0 = 25.62 +/- 0.1 for this galaxy
based on the I-magnitude of the red giant branch (RGB) tip and adopting E(V-I)
= 0.05.

analysis (SSA) to the study of nonstationary time series of length $N$ whose
intermittency can give rise to the divergence of their variance. SSA relies on
the construction of the lag-covariance matrix C on M lagged copies of the time
series over a fixed window width W to detect the regular part of the
variability in that window in terms of the minimal number of oscillatory
components; here W = M Dt, with Dt the time step. The proposed multi-scale SSA
is a local SSA analysis within a moving window of width M <= W <= N.
Multi-scale SSA varies W, while keeping a fixed W/M ratio, and uses the
eigenvectors of the corresponding lag-covariance matrix C_M as a data-adaptive
wavelets; successive eigenvectors of C_M correspond approximately to successive
derivatives of the first mother wavelet in standard wavelet analysis.
Multi-scale SSA thus solves objectively the delicate problem of optimizing the
analyzing wavelet in the time-frequency domain, by a suitable localization of
the signal's covariance matrix. We present several examples of application to
synthetic signals with fractal or power-law behavior which mimic selected
features of certain climatic and geophysical time series. A real application is
to the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) monthly values for 1933-1996. Our
methodology highlights an abrupt periodicity shift in the SOI near 1960. This
abrupt shift between 4 and 3 years supports the Devil's staircase scenario for
the El Nino/Southern Oscillation phenomenon.

due to attractive gluonic interactions. At lower densities of order
$\Lambda_{QCD}^3$, it has been proposed that instanton generated vertices may
play an important role in the Cooper pair formation. We study the
renormalization group flow to the Fermi surface of the full set of couplings
generated by gluonic and instanton interactions. In earlier work we showed that
if the gluonic interactions dominate at the matching scale, their running
determines the scale of the Cooper pair formation Delta. Here we consider all
possibilities, including the one in which the instanton interactions dominate
all others at the matching scale. In the latter case we find that a number of
additional induced couplings (including the gluonic ones) reach their Landau
poles almost simultaneously with the instanton vertex. Presumably all
contribute to the Cooper pair formation. The most important consequence of
including all the couplings is a large increase in the gap size Delta.

depends on a scale at which nonperturbative effects become important. The quark

the sine-Gordon model with the same T=0 identification between coupling

for the Riemann Zeta Function. The topics reviewed here include: Weil's
criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis and its probabilistic interpretation,
various formulations of the contribution corresponding to the real place,
Haran's version of the Explicit Formula, and the author's own derivation which
puts all places on the same footing. This derivation, an addendum to Tate's
Thesis, is in the spirit of Weil's insights towards an adelic understanding of
the Explicit Formula. Whereas the analyst would likely formulate the Explicit
Formula as a multiplicative convolution, Haran's theorem shows it is also an
additive convolution. An intriguing conductor operator is considered whose
spectral analysis is equivalent to the Explicit Formula. At a finite place it
has a positive cuspidal spectrum. I also comment on the flexibility still left
in the Explicit Formula, which shows that it has a symmetry group containing
the non-zero rational numbers.

GeV/nucleon. First we estimate the energy density pile-up at mid-rapidity and
calculate its excitation function: The energy density is decomposed into
hadronic and partonic contributions. A detailed analysis of the collision
dynamics in the framework of a microscopic transport model shows the importance
of partonic degrees of freedom and rescattering of leading (di)quarks in the
early phase of the reaction for E > 30 GeV/nucleon. The energy density reaches
up to 4 GeV/fm^3, 95% of which are contained in partonic degrees of freedom. It
is shown that cells of hadronic matter, after the early reaction phase, can be
viewed as nearly chemically equilibrated. This matter never exceeds energy
densities of 0.4 GeV/fm^3, i.e. a density above which the notion of separated
hadrons loses its meaning. The final reaction stage is analyzed in terms of
hadron ratios, freeze-out distributions and a source analysis for final state
pions.

inspired by the literature on vague predicates, we introduce the concept of an
opaque predicate. While in the case of vague predicates there is a kind of
indeterminacy with respect to the predicate, in the sense that the vagueness
concerns whether a well-determined object satisfies it or not, in the case of
opaque predicates the indeterminacy is with regard to the objects which should
satisfy them. In other words, their extensions are not well-defined, despite
the fact that the conditions for an object to satisfy the predicates are
well-known. We suggest that such opaque predicates (and more generally, what we
call opaque relations) can be characterized by a logic which encompasses a
semantics founded in quasi-set theory, and call their extensions veiled sets.
