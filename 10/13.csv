well-fitted by rapid absorption of the blackbody, and progressive covering of

covering shows that the Comptonized emission region is extended, consistent
with it originating in the accretion disk corona. The strong unabsorbed

Comptonized emission at all stages of dipping. There is no detectable change in
the low energy cut-off of the spectrum in dipping which supports the

function evolves only mildly between z=3 and z=1. The mass evolution of

have a different Safronov number (the dimensionless ratio of stellar binding

increasing the importance of physical collisions relative to gravitational

  Consistent with previous studies, we find that systems whose constituent
particles follow the Salpeter initial mass function rapidly undergo core
collapse through Spitzer's mass segregation instability. All rotationally
flattened systems show a decrease in flattening with time, consistent with
Fokker-Planck calculations. An interesting new result concerns the

configuration for each experiment is an isotropic Kuzmin-Kutuzov model. The
dynamical evolution is simulated with the N-body tree code of Hernquist,
modified to incorporate physical stellar collisions, stellar evolution, stellar
mass loss and compact remnant formation, and star formation. In some
simulations we have added a large accreting central black hole. In all systems
the velocity dispersion in the halo evolves toward a radially biased state. In
systems containing a central black hole, the dispersion becomes tangentially
biased in the core, whereas it remains isotropic in systems with no black hole.
Collisions tend to produce a single dominant stellar merger product, as opposed
to a swarm of intermediate-mass stars. In cases where we have suppressed all
processes except relaxation and physical collisions, objects with greater
flattening produce larger stars through mergers. In systems where stellar
ejecta are allowed to escape the system, mass loss from the heavy core stars
temporarily reduces the core density and collision rate.
  Most of the simulations performed reproduced the ratio of the central
collision time scale to the central relaxation time scale found in the dwarf
elliptical galaxy M32. The rapid central evolution of these systems due to
collisions and relaxation, combined with scaling the results in N, suggests
that we are either viewing M32 at a peculiar moment in its history, or that its

and the variance squared $\xibar_2^2$. Suppose one is given unbiased estimators
for $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_2^2$ respectively, taking a ratio of the two does
not necessarily result in an unbiased estimator of $S_3$. Exactly such an
estimation-bias affects most existing measurements of $S_3$. Furthermore,
common estimators for $\xibar_3$ and $\xibar_2$ suffer also from this kind of
estimation-bias themselves: for $\xibar_2$, it is equivalent to what is
commonly known as the integral constraint. We present a unifying treatment
allowing all these estimation-biases to be calculated analytically. They are in
general negative, and decrease in significance as the survey volume increases,
for a given smoothing scale. We present a re-analysis of some existing
measurements of the variance and skewness and show that most of the well-known

different sizes, can be attributed to the volume-dependent estimation-biases.
This affects the inference of the galaxy-bias(es) from these surveys. Our

in thin circumnuclear disks near the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
Using general radiative and kinematic considerations and taking account of the
observed flux variability, we argue that the maser emission regions are clumpy,
a conclusion that is independent of the detailed mechanism (X-ray heating,
shocks, etc.) driving the collisionally pumped masers. We examine scenarios in
which the clumps represent discrete gas condensations (i.e., clouds) and do not
merely correspond to velocity irregularities in the disk. We show that even two
clouds that overlap within the velocity coherence length along the line of
sight could account (through self-amplification) for the entire maser flux of a
high-velocity ``satellite'' feature in sources like NGC 4258 and NGC 1068, and
we suggest that cloud self-amplification likely contributes also to the flux of
the background-amplifying ``systemic'' features in these objects. Analogous
interpretations have previously been proposed for water maser sources in
Galactic star-forming regions. We argue that this picture provides a natural
explanation of the time-variability characteristics of extragalactic megamaser

the sufficiency of the model. In this paper, we rederive the model from a

enhanced, which is the situation in the underdoped cuprates.

Here syntactical hierarchical phrase trees are subject to a similar analysis,

is mentioned. The phrase tree can be represented by a matrix and the elements
of the matrix can be represented by triangles. The height at which branching
occurs is not prescribed in previous syntatic models, but it is by using the
ultrametric matrix. The ambiguity of which branching height to choose is
resolved by postulating that branching occurs at the lowest height available.
An ultrametric produces a measure of the complexity of sentences: presumably
the complexity of sentence increases as a language is aquired so that this can
be tested. A All ultrametric triangles are equilateral or isocles, here it is
shown that X structur implies that there are no equilateral triangles.

of q q bar -> Pi Pi Pi as opposed to the transition rates for q q bar -> Pi Pi,
within the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that has manifest chiral symmetry. Feynman
diagrams appropriate to this process can be classified according to the
expansion in the inverse number of colors 1/N_c. Two of these types of graphs
are seen to be either 's-like' or 't-like' in nature. A further graph that
contains both s-like and t-like elements, and which is denoted as st-like, is
also present. To describe such a process with two incoming and three outgoing
particles, it is necessary to extend the number of Mandelstam invariants. It is
convenient to introduce seven such variables, of which only five are
independent. The cross section for two incoming particles to three outgoing
particles is then reexpressed in integral form in terms of these invariants. As
a function of sqrt s, the final expression is reduced to an integral over the
four remaining invariants. The limits of integration, which are now
non-trivial, are also discussed. The transition rate for the explicit case of u
u bar -> Pi^+ Pi^- Pi^0, is evaluated numerically, assuming non-chiral pions,
m_Pi = 135MeV. The rate for three pion production is found to be of the same
order of magnitude as for two pion production, making this a non-negligible
contribution to hadronization.

the extent of decoherence this theory predicts. We treat first a static state
which, if one were to ignore quantum gravitational effects, would be a quantum
superposition of two spatially displaced states of a single classically well
describable ball of uniform mass density in empty space. Estimating the quantum
gravitational effects on this system within a simple Newtonian approximation,
we obtain formulae which predict e.g. that as long as the mass of the ball is
considerably larger than the Planck mass, such a would-be-coherent static
superposition will actually be decohered whenever the separation of the centres
of mass of the two ball-states excedes a small fraction (which decreases as the
mass of the ball increases) of the ball radius. We then obtain a formula for
the quantum gravitational correction to the would-be-pure density matrix of a
non-relativistic many-body Schroedinger wave function and argue that this
formula predicts decoherence between configurations which differ (at least) in
the ""relocation"" of a cluster of particles of Planck mass. We estimate the
entropy of some simple model closed systems, finding a tendency for it to
increase with ""matter-clumping"" suggestive of a link with existing

dimensional space. It is postulated that the equations support soliton-type
solutions (metrons) which reproduce all the basic field equations of quantum
field theory, including not only the Maxwell-Dirac-Einstein system, but also
all fields and symmetries of the Standard Model. Bell's theorem on the
non-existence of hidden-variable models of quantum phenomena is circumvented

stochastic resonance, both with respect to input noise intensity and stimulus
frequency. The latter resonance arises by matching the stimulus frequency to
the refractory time of the neuron. The Markov approach can be generalized to
other periodically driven stochastic processes containing a reset mechanism.

  style",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.59.1379",,"physics.data-an nlin.CD physics.comp-ph",,"  Fourier spectral estimates and, to a lesser extent, the autocorrelation
function are the primary tools to detect periodicities in experimental data in
the physical and biological sciences. We propose a new method which is more
reliable than traditional techniques, and is able to make clear identification
of periodic behavior when traditional techniques do not. This technique is
based on an information theoretic reduction of linear (autoregressive) models
so that only the essential features of an autoregressive model are retained.
These models we call reduced autoregressive models (RARM). The essential
features of reduced autoregressive models include any periodicity present in
the data. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence from both experimental
and artificial data, to demonstrate that this technique will reliably detect
periodicities if and only if they are present in the data. There are strong
information theoretic arguments to support the statement that RARM detects
periodicities if they are present. Surrogate data techniques are used to ensure
the converse. Furthermore, our calculations demonstrate that RARM is more
robust, more accurate, and more sensitive, than traditional spectral
techniques.

restricted to just two nonorthogonal states can be surprisingly rich in
physics. In this paper, we explore the extent of this statement through a
review of three topics: (1) ``nonlocality without entanglement'' as exhibited
in binary quantum communication channels, (2) the tradeoff between information
gain and state disturbance for two prescribed states, and (3) the quantitative
clonability of those states. Each topic in its own way quantifies the extent to
which two states are ``quantum'' with respect to each other, i.e., the extent
to which the two together violate some classical precept. It is suggested that
even toy examples such as these hold some promise for shedding light on the
foundations of quantum theory.

considered. The generalization which gives a general quadratic Hamiltonian
system does not change the classical equation of motion. Based on the
observation by Feynman and Hibbs, the propagators (kernels) of the systems are
calculated from the classical action, in terms of solutions of the classical
equation of motion: two homogeneous and one particular solutions. The kernels
are then used to find wave functions which satisfy the Schr\""{o}dinger
equation. One of the wave functions is shown to be that of a Gaussian pure
state. In every case considered, we prove that the kernel does not depend on
the way of choosing the classical solutions, while the wave functions depend on
the choice. The generalization which gives a rather complicated quadratic
Hamiltonian is simply interpreted as acting an unitary transformation to the
driven harmonic oscillator system in the Hamiltonian formulation.
