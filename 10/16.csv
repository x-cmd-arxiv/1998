demarking the inner edge of the spiral arm, but beyond a certain point along
the arm the emission shifts downstream from the dust lane to become better
aligned with the young stars seen in blue and H-beta images. This morphology
resembles that of the western arm of M100. Three possibilities, none of which

from the dust lane: heating of the CO by UV radiation from young stars, heating
by low-energy cosmic rays, and a molecular medium consisting of two (diffuse
and dense) components which react differently to the density wave. Regardless,
the question of what CO emission traces along this spiral arm is a complicated
one. Strong tangential streaming is observed where the arm crosses the
kinematic major axis of the galaxy, implying that the shear becomes locally
prograde in the arms. Inferred from the streaming is a very high gas surface
density of about 230 solar masses/pc**2 and an arm-interarm contrast greater
than 2.3 in the part of the arm near the major axis. Using two different
criteria, we find that the gas at this location is well above the threshold for
gravitational instability -- much more clearly so than in either M51 or M100.

(ULIGs) is still in question. Recently, Genzel et al. made mid-infrared (MIR)
spectroscopy of a large number of ULIGs and found that the major energy source
in them is massive stars formed in the recent starburst activity; i.e., $\sim$
70% -- 80% of the sample are predominantly powered by the starburst. However,
it is known that previous optical spectroscopic observations showed that the
majority of ULIGs are classified as Seyferts or LINERs (low-ionization nuclear
emission-line regions). In order to reconcile this difference, we compare types
of emission-line activity for a sample of ULIGs which have been observed in
both optical and MIR. We confirm the results of previous studies that the
majority of ULIGs classified as LINERs based on the optical emission-line
diagnostics turn to be starburst-dominated galaxies based on the MIR ones.
Since the MIR spectroscopy can probe more heavily-reddened, inner parts of the
ULIGs, it is quite unlikely that the inner parts are powered by the starburst
while the outer parts are powered by non-stellar ionization sources. The most
probable resolution of this dilemma is that the optical emission-line nebulae
with the LINER properties are powered predominantly by shock heating driven by
the superwind activity; i.e., a blast wave driven by a collective effect of a
large number of supernovae in the central region of galaxy mergers.

review the major reported cases of induced seismicity in various parts of the
world and find that both pore pressure changes (+/-p) and mass transfers (+/-m)
leading to incremental deviatoric stresses of <<1 MPa are sufficient to trigger
seismic instabilities in the uppermost crust with magnitude ranging up to 7.0
in otherwise historically aseismic areas. Once triggered, stress variations of
at least 1 order of magnitude less but still larger than the ~0.01 MPa tidal
stress are enough to sustain seismic activity. We argue that these observations
are in accord with the SOC hypothesis as they show that a significant fraction
of the crust is not far from instability and can thus be made unstable by
minute perturbations. Not all perturbations, however, trigger seismic activity;
this is also compatible with the SOC hypothesis which embodies naturally the
existence of large heterogeneities in the stress field. In conclusion, the
properties of induced seismicity and their rationalization in terms of the SOC
concept provide further evidence that potential seismic hazards extend over a
much larger area than that where earthquakes are frequent.

fluids separated by a piston whose mass is equal to the mass of the fluid
particles we obtain a rigorous explicit stationary non-equilibrium solution of
the Boltzmann equation. It is shown that at equal pressures on both sides of
the piston, the temperature difference induces a non-zero average velocity,
oriented toward the region of higher temperature. It thus turns out that
despite the absence of macroscopic forces the asymmetry of fluctuations results
in a systematic macroscopic motion. This remarkable effect is analogous to the
dynamics of stochastic ratchets, where fluctuations conspire with spatial
anisotropy to generate direct motion. However, a different mechanism is

different approaches used in both codes to model the underlying physics is
analyzed using computer simulations performed with the program AIRES. The most
relevant observables for both single collisions and air showers are studied for
primary energies ranging from $10^{14}$ eV up to $10^{20.5}$ eV. In addition,
the evolution of lateral and energy distributions during the shower development
is presented. Our analysis seems to indicate that the behaviour of shower
observables does not largely reflect the strong differences observed in single

  published in Topology and Its Applications",,,,"math.GT",,"  Four constructions of Seifert surfaces - Hopf plumbing, arborescent plumbing,
basketry, and T-bandword handle decomposition - are described, and some
interrelationships found, e.g.: arborescent Seifert surfaces are baskets;
Hopf-plumbed baskets are precisely homogeneous T-bandword surfaces.
  A Seifert surface is Hopf-plumbed if it is a 2-disk D or if it can be
constructed by plumbing a positive or negative Hopf annulus A(O,-1) or A(O,1)
to a Hopf-plumbed surface along a proper arc. A Seifert surface is a basket if
it is D or it can be constructed by plumbing an n-twisted unknotted annulus
A(O,n) to a basket along a proper arc in D. A Seifert surface is arborescent if
it is D, or it is A(O,n), or it can be constructed by plumbing A(O,n) to an
arborescent Seifert surface along a transverse arc of an annulus plumband.
Every arborescent Seifert surface is a basket.
  A tree T embedded in the complex plane C determines a set of generators for a
braid group. An espalier is a tree in the closed lower halfplane with vertices
on the real line R. If T is an espalier then words b in the T-generators
correspond nicely to T-bandword surfaces S(b). (For example, if I is an
espalier with an edge from p to p+1 for p=1,...,n-1, then the I-generators of
the n-string braid group are the standard generators; when Seifert's algorithm
is applied to the closed braid diagram of a word in those generators, the
result is an I-bandword surface.)
  Theorem. For any espalier T, a T-bandword surface S(b) is a Hopf-plumbed
basket iff b is homogeneous iff S(b) is a fiber surface iff S(b) is connected
and incompressible. A Hopf-plumbed basket S (for instance, an arborescent fiber
surface) is isotopic to a homogeneous T-bandword surface for some espalier T.

  fields","14 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.59.2269",,"physics.atom-ph",,"  A theory of matter wave interference is developed in which resonant optical
fields interact with two-level atoms. When recoil effects are included, spatial
modulation of the atomic density can occur for times that are greater than or
comparable with the inverse recoil frequency. In this regime, the atoms exhibit
matter-wave interference. Two specific atom field geometries are considered. In
the first, atoms characterized by a homogeneous velocity distribution are
subjected to a single radiation pulse. The pulse excites the atoms which then
decay back to the lower state. The spatial modulation of the total atomic
density is calculated as a function of $t$, where $t$ is the time following the
pulse. In contrast to the normal Talbot effect, the spatially modulated density
is not a periodic function of $ t,$ owing to spontaneous emission; however,
after a sufficiently long time, the contribution from spontaneous processes no
longer plays a role and the Talbot periodicity is restored. In the second
atom-field geometry, there are two pulses separated by an interval $T$. The
atomic velocity distribution in this case is assumed to be inhomogeneously
broadened. In contrast to the normal Talbot-Lau effect, the spatially modulated
density is not a periodic function of $T$, owing to spontaneous emission;
however, for sufficiently long time, the contribution from spontaneous
processes no longer plays a role and the Talbot periodicity is restored. The
structure of the spatially modulated density is studied, and is found to mirror
the atomic density following the first pulse. The spatially modulated atomic
density serves as an indirect probe of the distribution of spontaneously
emitted radiation.

hexamer are examined theoretically with particular reference to tunneling
splittings and spectroscopy. The three lowest barrier rearrangements of the
water dimer are characterized by {\it ab initio} methods and compared with the
results of previous constrained calculations. The acceptor-tunneling pathway
does not proceed via a direct rotation around the $C_2$ axis of the acceptor,
but rather via relatively asynchronous rotation of the donor about the hydrogen
bond and an associated `wag' of the acceptor. Rearrangements between different
cage isomers of the water hexamer are studied for two empirical potentials. The
experimentally observed triplet splittings may be the result of flip and
bifurcation rearrangements of the two single-donor, single-acceptor monomers.
Two-dimensional quantum calculations of the nuclear dynamics suggest that
delocalization over more than one cage isomer may occur, especially in excited
states.

new challenges to theory because the interpretation and prediction of such
spectra requires a detailed understanding of the potential energy surface (PES)
away from minima. In particular we need a global description of the PES in
terms of a complete reaction graph. Hence all the transition states and
associated mechanisms which might give rise to observable tunneling splittings
must be characterized. It may be possible to guess the detailed permutations of
atoms from the transition state alone, but experience suggests this is unwise.
  In this contribution a brief overview of the issues involved in treating the
large amplitude motions of such systems will be given, with references to more
detailed discussions and some specific examples. In particular we will consider
the effective molecular symmetry group, the classification of rearrangement
mechanisms, the location of minima and transition states and the calculation of
reaction pathways. The application of these theories to small water clusters
ranging from water dimer to water hexamer will then be considered. More details
can be found in recent reviews.
