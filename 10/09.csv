and solar models is analyzed. To obtain deeper insight into the issues of
plasma physics, the so-called ``intrinsic'' difference in gamma_1 is extracted,
that is, the difference due to the change in the equation of state alone. Our
method uses reference models based on two equations of state currently used in
solar modeling, the Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen (MHD) equation of state, and the OPAL
equation of state (developed at Livermore). Solar oscillation frequencies from
the SOI/MDI instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft during its first 144 days
in operation are used. Our results confirm the existence of a subtle effect of
the excited states in hydrogen that was previously studied only theoretically
(Nayfonov & Dappen 1998). The effect stems from internal partition function of
hydrogen, as used in the MHD equation of state. Although it is a pure-hydrogen
effect, it takes place in somewhat deeper layers of the Sun, where more than
90% of hydrogen is ionized, and where the second ionization zone of helium is
located. Therefore, the effect will have to be taken into account in reliable
helioseismic determinations of the astrophysically relevant helium-abundance of
the solar convection zone.

one-third belong to a more extended metal-poor distribution sloping gradually
down to low metallicity. The MDF can be remarkably well matched by a simple

preliminary comparison between simulation results and measurements from Keck
HIRES spectra, and discuss a recent determination of the slope and amplitude of
the linear mass power spectrum P(k) at z=2.5 from moderate resolution spectra.
The physical picture is simple if each QSO spectrum is viewed as a continuous
non-linear map of the line-of-sight density field rather than a collection of
discrete absorption lines. The distribution of flux decrements depends mainly
on the amplitude and PDF (Gaussian vs. non-Gaussian) of the primordial density
fluctuations. The threshold crossing frequency, analogous to the 3-d genus
curve, responds to the shape and amplitude of P(k) and to the values of Omega
and Lambda. Open and Lambda-CDM models agree well with the measured flux
decrement distribution at smoothing lengths of 25 km/s and 100 km/s and with
the threshold crossing frequency at 100 km/s. Discrepancy with the observed
threshold crossing frequency at 25 km/s may reflect the combined effects of
noise in the data and limited mass resolution of the simulations. The slope of
the measured P(k) agrees with the predictions of inflation+CDM models.
Combining the amplitude with COBE normalization imposes a constraint on these
models of the form Omega h^x n^y Omega_b^z = constant. Assuming Gaussian
primordial fluctuations and a power spectrum shape parameter Gamma~0.2,
consistency of the measured P(k) with the observed cluster mass function at z=0

then present both analytic and numerical models of these time lags resulting by
the process of Comptonization in a variety of hot electron configurations. We
argue that under the assumption that the observed spectra are due to
Comptonization, the dependence of the lags on the Fourier period provides a
means for mapping the spatial density profile of the hot electron plasma, while
the period at which the lags eventually level--off provides an estimate of the
size of the scattering cloud. We further examine the influence of the location
and spatial extent of the soft photon source on the form of the resulting lags
for a variety of configurations; we conclude that the study of the X-ray hard
lags can provide clues about these parameters of the Comptonization process
too. Fits of the existing data with our models indicate that the size of the
Comptonizing clouds are quite large in extent ($\sim$ 1 light second) with
inferred radial density profiles which are in many instances inconsistent with
those of the standard dynamical models, while the extent of the source of soft
photons appears to be much smaller than those of the hot electrons by roughly
two orders of magnitude and its location consistent with the center of the hot
electron corona.

In this paper we continue, focusing on repeating events. We find that, if all
planetary systems are similar to our own Solar System, reasonable extensions of
the present observing strategies would allow us to detect 3-6 repeating events
per year along the direction to the Bulge. Indeed, if planetary systems with
multiple planets are common, then future monitoring programs which lead to the
discovery of thousands of stellar-lens events will likely discover events in
which several different planets within a single system serve as lenses, with
light curves exhibiting multiple repetitions. In this paper we discuss
observing strategies to maximize the discovery of all wide-orbit planet-lens
events. We also compare the likely detection rates of planets in wide orbits to
those of planets located in the zone for resonant lensing. We find that,
depending on the values of the planet masses and stellar radii of the lensed
sources (which determine whether or not finite source size is important), and
also on the sensitivity of the photometry used by observers, the detection of
planets in wide orbits may be the primary route to the discovery of planets via
microlensing. We also discuss how the combination of resonant and wide-orbit
events can help us to learn about the distribution of planetary system
properties (S 6.1). In addition, by determining the fraction of short-duration
events due to planets, we indirectly derive information about the fraction of
all short-duration events that may be due to low-mass MACHOs (S 6.2).

show that it is a good way to minimize this bias. However, a correction of this

luminosity decreased from 2.1x10^38 erg/s (for an assumed distance of 10 kpc)
by a factor of ~7. The 2-200 keV spectrum can be modeled by a soft
multi-temperature disk blackbody and a hard power-law. During four of the
observations, there is evidence for deviations from a pure power-law shape >~20
keV which may be due to reflection. As the outburst decayed a number of
spectral trends are evident: (1) the amount of photoelectric absorption
decreased, (2) the spectrum became harder (i.e. the power-law index became
smaller), (3) the temperature of the disk blackbody decreased and (4) the
inferred inner disk radius increased by a factor of ~4. The change in the
accretion disk inner radius during the outburst is in contrast to results from
other soft X-ray transients. We find that the disk blackbody temperature
depends on the inner disk radius roughly as T=r^(-3/4). For a standard
Shakura-Sunyaev disk model this implies that the inferred mass accretion rate
at the inner disk radius did not change appreciably during the part of the

larger than predicted by an extrapolation of the Tully-Fisher relation. The
deviation from the extrapolated Tully-Fisher relation correlates with the
distance-independent mass-to-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B. The baryonic correction
for these gas rich galaxies is too small to explain the deviation from the
Tully-Fisher relation, unless a small mass-to-light ratio (M/L_B)_* <= 0.25 for
the stellar population is assumed. The second sample contains dwarf galaxies
with comparable rotational and random velocities. This sample, having Leo A as
a prototype, is consistent with an extrapolation of the classical Tully-Fisher
relation to lower luminosities. These dwarf galaxies are not particularly rich
in gas, but their mass is dominated by baryonic matter within their HI radius.
We suggest that any evolution of the deviating galaxies towards the

of HI with an increase in luminosity due to a larger accumulated stellar mass.

actually step-like across the centre. We predict that the minor axis emission
profile of the same dust in the far-infrared, at wavelength 200 microns, will
be much more symmetric than the optical profiles, implying nearly equal column
densities of dust on both sides of the minor axis.

it is purely differential and it does not depend on any assumption (apart from
the natural one that two sosies galaxies have similar absolute luminosities).
Nevertheless, the Malmquist bias has to be taken into account. The observations
behave exactly as predicted from the analytical formulation of the bias. Thus,
rejecting galaxies which are affected by the Malmquist bias we derive the
Hubble constant:
  H_o = 60 +- 10 (external) km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}
  If we strictly use the calibration obtained with HIPPARCOS and if the bias
found in the Period-Luminosity Relation is considered, the Hubble constant is
smaller than this ($\approx 55 km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$). This gives arguments in
favour of the long-distance scale. We briefly discuss possible improvements
aiming at still reducing the uncertainty.

dynamical system model shows that such non-local connections are intrinsic to
quantum-like chaos governing flow dynamics. The dynamical evolution of fractal
structures can be quantified in terms of ordered energy flow described by
mathematical functions which occur in the field of number theory. The
quantum-like chaos in atmospheric flows can be quantified in terms of the
following mathematical functions / concepts: (1) The fractal structure of the
flow pattern is resolved into an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the
quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for the internal structure and is
equivalent to a hierarchy of vortices. The incorporation of Fibonacci
mathematical series, representative of ramified bifurcations, indicates ordered
growth of fractal patterns. (2) The steady state emergence of progressively
larger fractal structures incorporates unique primary perturbation domains of
progressively increasing number equal to z/lnz where z, the length step growth
stage is equal to the length scale ratio of large eddy to turbulent eddy. In
number theory z/lnz gives the number of primes less than z. The model also
predicts that z/lnz represents the normalised cumulative variance spectrum of
the eddies and which follows statistical normal distribution. The important
result of the study is that the prime number spectrum is the same as the eddy
energy spectrum for quantum-like chaos in atmospheric flows.

possible. In this regime the extension approaches the contour length as
f^{-1/2} where f is the magnitude of the external force. The theory is used to
analyze experiments that have measured the extension of double-stranded DNA

incorporating a redesigned expansion cell that minimises vortex creation
arising from conventional hydrodynamic flow. The post-quench line-densities of
vorticity produced by the new cell are no more than 10^10 m^{-2}, a value that

cause position dependent energy loss. Due to strong local dissipation, pressure
and energy drop rapidly and material moves from `hot' to `cold' regions,
leading to even stronger dissipation and thus causing the density instability.
The assumption of `molecular chaos' is valid only in the homogeneous cooling
regime. As soon as the density instability occurs, the impact parameter is not
longer uniformly distributed. The pair-correlation and the structure functions
show that the molecular chaos assumption --- together with reasonable excluded
volume modeling --- is important for short distances and irrelevant on large
length scales.
  In this study, the probability distribution of the collision frequency is
examined for pipe flow and for freely cooling granular materials as well.
Uncorrelated events lead to a Poisson distribution for the collision
frequencies. In contrast, the fingerprint of the cooperative phenomena

SO(3) symmetry. In the magnetization process, we found a plateau at
m/m_{sat}=1/2, in which the ground state is ""uuud state"" (a collinear state
with four sublattices). The 1/2-plateau appears due to the strong four-spin
exchange interaction. This plateau survives against both quantum and thermal
fluctuations. Under a magnetic field which realizes the ""uuud"" ordered state, a
phase transition occurs at a finite temperature. We predict that low-density
solid 3He thin films may show the 1/2-plateau in the magnetization process.
Experimental observation of the plateau will verify strength of the four-spin
exchange. It is also discussed that this magnetization plateau can be
understood as an insulating-conducting transition in a particle picture.

sequence comparison. A natural approximation to this problem is a model in
which every pairs of letters of two ``sequences'' are matched independently of
the other pairs with probability 1/S, $S$ representing the size of the
alphabet. This model is analogous to a mean field version of the LCS problem,
which can be solved with a cavity approach (Eur. Phys. J. B 7-2(1999),pp.
293-308). We refine here this approximation by incorporating in a systematic
way correlations among the matches in the cavity calculation. We obtain a
series of closer and closer approximations to the LCS problem, which we
quantify in the large $S$ limit, both with a perturbative approach and by
Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that, as it happens in the expansion around
mean-field for other disordered systems, the corrections to our approximations
depend upon long-ranged correlation effects which render the large $S$
expansion non-perturbative.

invariant under conformal transformations of the spacetime metric. We first
extend the Brown-York quasilocal formalism to such theories to obtain the
``unreferenced'' quasilocal mass and prove it to be conformally invariant. The
appropriate reference term in this case is defined by generalizing the
Hawking-Horowitz prescription, which was originally proposed for general
relativity. For such a choice of reference term, the referenced quasilocal mass
for a general spacetime solution is obtained. This expression is shown to be a
conformal invariant provided the conformal factor is a monotonic function of
the scalar field. We apply this expression to the case of static spherically
symmetric solutions with arbitrary asymptotics to obtain the referenced
quasilocal mass of such solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the conformal
invariance of our quasilocal mass formula by applying it to specific cases of
four-dimensional charged black hole spacetimes, of both the asymptotically flat

stored in produced particles. Pion and kaon production probabilities are
studied as function of beam energy and their distribution in polar and
azimuthal angle. Special emphasis is put on medium effects expected for kaons
in dense nuclear matter at low energies. An enhanced strange particle yield is
found at all energies, its explanation at SPS energies is still controversial.
Experimental data on antibaryon and multistrange hyperon production is less
complete and does not allow for similar systematic studies.

``natural measure'' on the N-dimensional quantum systems (quant-ph/9804024),
but expressed surprise when it led them to conclude that for N = 2 x 2,
disentangled (separable) systems are more probable (0.632) in nature than
entangled ones. We contend, however, that ZHSL's (rejected) intuition has, in
fact, a sound theoretical basis, and that the a priori probability of
disentangled 2 x 2 systems should more properly be viewed as (considerably)
less than 0.5. We arrive at this conclusion in two quite distinct ways, the
first based on classical and the second, quantum considerations. Both
approaches, however, replace (in whole or part) the ZHSL (product) measure by
ones based on the volume elements of monotone metrics, which in the classical
case amounts to adopting the Jeffreys' prior of Bayesian theory. Only the
quantum-theoretic analysis (which yields the smallest probabilities of
disentanglement) uses the minimum number of parameters possible, N^2 - 1, as
opposed to N^2 + N - 1 (although this ""over-parameterization"", as recently
indicated by Byrd, should be avoidable). However, despite substantial
computation, we are not able to obtain precise estimates of these
probabilities, and the need for additional (possibly supercomputer) analyses is
indicated (particularly so, for higher-dimensional quantum systems, such as the
2 x 3 we also study here).

events localised in space-time while the clocks used for time definition and
the fields used in synchronisation or localisation procedures are necessarily
quantum systems.
  We outline an algebraic framework where basic requirements of quantum theory
and relativity are consistently dealt with. This approach which may be termed
as a `quantum relativity' is built on the algebra of symmetries. It contains
the definition of quantum observables associated with Einstein localisation in
space-time as well as the evaluation of their commutation relations including
the energy-time relation. These commutators also describe the relativistic
shifts undergone under frame transformations, not only for inertial frames but
also for uniformly accelerated frames. The quantum redshift laws differ from
their classical counterparts while still obeying universal metric properties.
  The paper presents this approach in terms closely connected to the seminal
Einstein conception of localisation in space-time and refers to already
published papers for more technical developments.
