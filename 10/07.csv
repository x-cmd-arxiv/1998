$\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ mixing. Vacuum $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$
oscillation has been proposed as one possible explanation of the Super
Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data. Based on the most recent primordial
abundance measurements, we find that the effective number of neutrino species
for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is $N_\nu\la 3.3$. Assuming that all three
active neutrinos are light (with masses $\ll 1$ MeV), we examine BBN
constraints on $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ mixing in two scenarios: (1) a
negligible lepton asymmetry (the standard picture); (2) the presence of a large
lepton asymmetry which has resulted from an amplification by
$\nu_\tau\leftrightarrow\nu_{s'}$ mixing ($\nu_{s'}$ being $\nu_s$ or another
sterile neutrino species). The latter scenario has been proposed recently to
reconcile the BBN constraints and large-angle $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$
mixing. We find that the large-angle $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ mixing in
the first scenario, which would yield $N_\nu\approx 4$, is ruled out as an
explanation of the Super Kamiokande data. It is conceivably possible for the
$\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ solution to evade BBN bounds in the second
scenario, but only if 200 eV$^2\la m^2_{\nu_\tau}-m^2_{\nu_{s'}}\la 10^4$
eV$^2$ is satisfied, and if $\nu_\tau$ decays non-radiatively with a lifetime
$\la 10^3$ years. This mass-squared difference implies 15 eV$\la
m_{\nu_\tau}\la 100$ eV if $\nu_{s'}$ is much lighter than $\nu_\tau$. We
conclude that maximal (or near maximal) $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_\tau$ mixing
is a more likely explanation of the Super Kamiokande data.

fainter M*). The normalization of the luminosity function is about a factor of

their Interstellar Medium to investigate the cause for their low star formation
rates (SFR).Due to their massive halos, stellar disks of LSB galaxies are very
stable and thin. Lack of dust makes the projected edge-on surface brightness of
LSB galaxies comparable to the projected edge-on surface brightness of
dust-rich High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies of similar size.
  We show that the low surface densities found in LSB galaxies are by
themselves not enough to explain the slow evolution of LSB galaxies. A low
metal content of the gas is essential. As a consequence the gas cools
inefficiently, resulting in an almost negligible cold gas fraction. We show
that LSB galaxies must have molecular gas fractions of less than 5 percent.
  Our best model has a SFR which is on average low but fluctuates strongly.
This causes the large spread in colors of LSB galaxies. From a distribution of
birthrate parameters we conclude that the presently-known and modeled gas-rich
blue LSB galaxies constitute the majority of the total population of gas-rich
LSB disk galaxies. We deduce the existence of an additional red, quiescent and
gas-rich population which constitutes less than 20 percent of the total
population. This does not rule out the existence of a large number of gas-poor
LSB galaxies. These must however have had an evolutionary history dramatically
different from that of the gas-rich galaxies.

source. (ii) Emission from the disk of the galaxy, with Lx = 7E39 erg/sec, that

thin radiatively cooling medium in the long-wavelength limit is studied
numerically. The accepted cooling function generates in thermal equilibrium a
bistable equation of state $P(\rho)$. The unperturbed state is taken close to
the upper (low-density) unstable state with infinite compressibility
($dP/d\rho= 0$). The evolution is shown to proceed in three different stages.
At first stage, pressure and density set in the equilibrium equation of state,
and velocity profile steepens gradually as in case of pressure-free flows. At
second stage, those regions of the flow where anomalous pressure (i.e. with
negative compressibility) holds, create velocity profile more sharp than in
pressure-free case, which in turn results in formation of a very narrow
(short-wavelength) region where gas separates the equilibrium equation of state
and pressure equilibrium sets in rapidly. On this stage, variation in pressure
between narrow dense region and extended environment does not exceed more than
0.01 of the unperturbed value. On third stage, gas in the short-wavelength
region reaches the second (high-density) stable state, and pressure balance
establishes through the flow with pressure equal to the one in the unperturbed
state. In external (long-wavelength) regions, gas forms slow isobaric inflow
toward the short-wavelength layer. The duration of these stages decreases when
the ratio of the acoustic time to the radiative cooling time increases. Limits
in which nonlinear evolution of thermally unstable long-wavelength
perturbations develops in isobaric regime are obtained.

less variability in the warm absorber parameters. (b) The possibility of a
dusty warm absorber in IRAS 13349+2438 is explored on the basis of
photoionization models for dusty warm gas and explicit ROSAT spectral fits. (c)
The X-ray spectrum of the NLSy1 1E0117.2-2837 is analyzed. It can be
successfully described by a very steep powerlaw of photon index G_x = -4, or
alternatively by a warm-absorbed flat powerlaw. UV-EUV emission lines expected
to arise from the warm material are predicted. (d) The strong spectral

observation, to ~ -2.2$ in our subsequent pointing) is examined in terms of
warm absorption.

galaxy NGC5846, combining measurements from two observatories, ROSAT and ASCA.
We map the gas temperature distribution and find a central cool region within
an approximately isothermal gas halo extending to a radius of about 50 kpc, and
evidence for a temperature decrease at larger radii. With a radially falling
temperature profile, the total mass converges to 9.6+/-1.0 10^12 Msun at ~230
kpc radius. Using the spectroscopic measurements, we also derive radial
distributions for the heavy elements silicon and iron and find that the
abundances of both decrease with galaxy radius. The mass ratio of Si to Fe lies
between the theoretical predictions for element production in SN Ia and SN II,
suggesting an important role for SN Ia, as well as SN II, for gas enrichment in
ellipticals. Using the SN Ia yield of Si, we set an upper limit of 0.012 SNU
for the SN Ia rate at radii >50 kpc, which is independent of possible
uncertainties in the iron L-shell modeling. We compare our observations with
the theoretical predictions for the chemical evolution of ellipticals, taken
from Matteucci & Gibson (1995). We conclude that the metal content in stars, if
explained by the star formation duration, requires a significant decline in the
duration of star formation with galaxy radius, ranging from ~1 Gyr at the
center to ~0.01 Gyr at 100 kpc radius. Alternatively, the decline in
metallicity with galaxy radius may be caused by a similar drop with radius in
the efficiency of star formation. Based on the Si and Fe measurements presented
in this paper, we conclude that the latter scenario is preferred, unless a
dependence of the SN Ia rate on stellar metallicity is invoked. (Abridged).

prescription, when the (r$\phi$) component of the stress tensor was
approximated by ($\alpha$ P) with a unknown constant $\alpha$. This

massive particles in rapid movement undergoing inelastic collisions. We
introduce a class of models of driven granular gases for which the stationary
state is the result of the balance between the dissipation and the random
forces which inject energies. These models exhibit a genuine thermodynamic
limit, i.e. at fixed density the mean values of kinetic energy and dissipated
energy per particle are independent of the number $N$ of particles, for large
values of $N$. One has two regimes: when the typical relaxation time $\tau$ of
the driving Brownian process is small compared with the mean collision time
$\tau_c$ the spatial density is nearly homogeneous and the velocity probability
distribution is gaussian. In the opposite limit $\tau \gg \tau_c$ one has
strong spatial clustering, with a fractal distribution of particles, and the
velocity probability distribution strongly deviates from the gaussian one.
Simulations performed in one and two dimensions under the {\it Stosszahlansatz}
Boltzmann approximation confirm the scenario. Furthermore we analyze the
instabilities bringing to the spatial and the velocity clusterization. Firstly,
in the framework of a mean-field model, we explain how the existence of the
inelasticity can bring to a spatial clusterization; on the other side we
discuss, in the framework of a Langevin dynamics treating the collisions in a
mean-field way, how a non-gaussian distribution of velocity can arise. The
comparison between the numerical and the analytical results exhibits an
excellent agreement.

Initially, the granular Ni films exhibited negative MR curves peaked at H=0. As
different materials were deposited onto the grains hysteresis developed in the
MR. This behavior is ascribed to an increase of the typical domain size due to
magnetic coupling between grains. The strength of the inter-grain coupling is
found to correlate with the magnetic susceptibility of the overlayer material.
We discuss possible mechanisms for this coupling and suggest that the data may
reflect the existence of a magnetic proximity effect (analogous to the
well-known effect in superconductivity) in which a ferromagnetic moment is

two components : (1) our key assumption is that a crash may be caused by local
self-reinforcing imitation between noise traders. If the tendency for noise
traders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain point
called the ``critical'' point, all noise traders may place the same order
(sell) at the same time, thus causing a crash. The interplay between the
progressive strengthening of imitation and the ubiquity of noise is
characterized by the hazard rate, i.e. the probability per unit time that the
crash will happen in the next instant if it has not happened yet. (2) Since the
crash is not a certain deterministic outcome of the bubble, it remains rational
for traders to remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rate
of growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash. Our model distinguishes
between the end of the bubble and the time of the crash,: the rational
expectation constraint has the specific implication that the date of the crash
must be random. The theoretical death of the bubble is not the time of the
crash because the crash could happen at any time before, even though this is
not very likely. The death of the bubble is the most probable time for the
crash. There also exists a finite probability of attaining the end of the
bubble without crash. Our model has specific predictions about the presence of
certain critical log-periodic patterns in pre-crash prices, associated with the
deterministic components of the bubble mechanism. We provide empirical evidence
showing that these patterns were indeed present before the crashes of 1929,
1962 and 1987 on Wall Street and the 1997 crash on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange. These results are compared with statistical tests on synthetic data.

vanishing dimerization. The internal oscilations of the magnon give rise to a

the exact rate of bubble nucleation and sphaleron transitions. Most of the

that the fit to the B -> D pi branching ratios substantially depends on the
model describing the Isgur-Wise function and on the value of its slope. This
dependence can be reduced by substituting the BR(B -> D pi) with suitable
ratios of non-leptonic to differential semileptonic BRs. In this way, we obtain
a model-independent determination of these parameters. Using these results, the
B -> D form factors at q^2=M_pi^2 can be extracted from a fit of the BR(B -> D
pi). The comparison between the form factors obtained in this way and the
corresponding measurements in semileptonic decays can be used as a test of
(generalized) factorization free from the uncertainties due to heavy-heavy form
factor modeling. Finally, we present predictions for yet-unmeasured D pi and D
K branching ratios and extract f_{D_s} and f_{D_s^*} from B -> DD_s decays. We

the $n (\geq 4)$-point initial correlation functions that are usually discarded
in the standard framework can in fact be discarded. Two calculational schemes
are introduced, the one is formulated on the basis of the initial particle
distribution function and the one is formulated on the basis of the ``

to a generalized relativistic kinetic or Boltzmann equation. At the second
part, using the perturbative loop-expansion scheme for an $O (N)$ linear
$\sigma$ model, we analyze how the chiral phase transition proceeds through
disoriented chiral condensates. The system of coupled equations that governs
the spacetime evolution of the condensate or order-parameter fields is derived.
The region where the curvature of the ``potential'' is negative is dealt with
by introducing the random-force fields. Application to simple situations is
made.

Hilbert-Schmidt norm and spectra of the operators A and A' are separated.
Conditions are formulated when the perturbation V(z) may be replaced with a
``potential'' W independent of z and such that the operator H=A+W has the same
spectrum and the same eigenfunctions (more precisely, a part of spectrum and a
respective part of eigenfunctions system) as the initial spectral problem. The
operator H is constructed as a solution of the non-linear operator equation
H=A+V(H) with a specially chosen operator-valued function V(H). In the case if

Friedrichs model, a basis property of the eigenfunction system of the operator
H is proved. A scattering theory is developed for H in the case where the

phase mismatch and driving in the harmonic mode is analyzed. The general
formulae about the fixed points and their stability as well as the squeezing
spectra calculated linearizing around such points are given. The use of a
nonlinear normalization allows to disentangle in the spectra the dynamic
response of the system from the contributions of the various noisy inputs. A
general ``reference'' model for one-mode systems is developed in which the
dynamic aspects of the problem are not contaminated by static contributions
from the noisy inputs. The physical insight gained permits the elaboration of
general criteria to optimize the noise suppression performance. With respect to
the squeezing in the fundamental mode the optimum working point is located near
the first turning point of the dispersive bistability induced by cascading of
the second order nonlinear response. The nonlinearities induced by conventional
crystals appear enough to reach it being the squeezing ultimately limited by
the escape efficiency of the cavity. In the case of the harmonic mode both,
finite phase mismatch and/or harmonic mode driving allow for an optimum dynamic
response of the system something not possible in the standard phase matched
Second Harmonic Generation. The squeezing is then limited by the losses in the
harmonic mode, allowing for very high degrees of squeezing because of the
non-resonant nature of the mode. This opens the possibility of very high
performances using artificial materials with resonantly enhanced
nonlinearities. It is also shown how it is possible to substantially increase
the noise reduction and at the same time to more than double the output power
for parameters corresponding to reported experiments.
