polarization profiles of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at frequencies between 410
and 1414 MHz. These data include the first polarimetric observations of several
of the pulsars, and the first low-frequency polarization profiles for others.
Our observations support previous suggestions that the pulse shapes and
polarimetry of MSPs are more complex than those of their slower relatives. An
immediate conclusion is that polarimetry-based classification schemes proposed
for young pulsars are of only limited use when applied to millisecond pulsars.

  updated version","CNU-A&SS-10/08","10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02832.x",,"astro-ph",,"  When a microlensing light curve is contaminated by blended light from
unresolved stars near the line of sight to the lensed star, the light curve
shape and corresponding parameterization for the event will differ from the
values expected when the event is not affected by blending. As a result,
blending makes it difficult to identify the major lens population and to
estimate the amount of lensing matter. In order to estimate the effect of
blending on the result of lensing experiments, it is, therefore, essential to
know how the observed lensing parameters change depending on the fraction of
blended light. Previously, the changed lensing parameters were obtained with a
statistical method that not only required a large amount of computation time
but also was prone to uncertainty. In this paper, we derive analytic relations
between the lensing parameters with and without the effect of blending. By
using these relations, we investigate the dependence of the observed lensing
parameters on the amount of blended light, the impact parameter, and the
threshold amplification for event detection.

The model is based on taking different flavor groups to describe the different

guided by the structure of its wavefunction. The model corresponds to assigning
different effective masses to a quark depending on which baryon is being
considered. Using the values extracted from the fit, the magnetic moments of
the $\Omega^-$ and the $\Delta^{++}$ have been predicted and the comparison to
the existing experimental values is quite satisfactory.

This result precisely proves a conjecture mentioned previously that the SL(2,Z)
S-duality of a super D-string action in a flat background is also valid even in
a curved IIB background geometry. We point further out the validity of the more
generalized conjecture that various duality relations of super D-brane and

decomposing the cross section into a product of a back ground part and a
barrier penetration probability resulting from the repulsive Coulomb
interaction. This tunneling probability contains the dominant energy variation
and it can be calculated analytically based on the same principles as Wannier's
description for threshold ionization under attractive forces. Good agreement is
found with the available experimental cross sections on detachment by electron
impact from $D^{-}$, $O^{-}$ and $B^{-}$.

to justify the mathematical formalism on the basis of three main assumptions:
the first defines the subject matter, the second introduces amplitudes as the
tools for quantitative reasoning, and the third is an interpretative rule that
provides the link to the prediction of experimental outcomes. In this work we
introduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to
prefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be
`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique
inner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the
principle of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.
Armed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an
earlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient
reason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical
probabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of
amplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time
evolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on
the conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct
entropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution
has been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables
and we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information
theory. Finally, we discuss how various connections among the postulates of
quantum theory are made explicit within this approach.
