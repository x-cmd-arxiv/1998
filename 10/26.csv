processes, e.g. accretion-induced collapse of magnetized white dwarfs, merger
of two neutron stars. During the birth of such a pulsar, an initial fireball
available for a gamma-ray burst (GRB) may occur. We here study evolution of a
postburst relativistic fireball with energy injection from the pulsar through
magnetic dipole radiation, and find that the magnitude of the optical afterglow
from this fireball first decreases with time, subsequently flattens, and
finally declines again. This may provide a natural explanation for the behavior
of the lightcurve of the afterglow of GRB970228 if this burst resulted from the
birth of a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar.

  in the ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Ongoing searches for supernovae (SNe) at cosmological distances have recently
started to provide large numbers of events with measured redshifts and apparent
brightnesses. Compared to quasars or galaxies, Type Ia SNe represent a
population of sources with well-known intrinsic properties, and could be used
to detect gravitational lensing even in the absence of multiple or highly
distorted images. We investigate the lensing effect of background SNe due to
mass condensations in three popular cold dark matter cosmologies (LambdaCDM,
OCDM, SCDM), and compute lensing frequencies, rates of SN explosions, and
distributions of arrival time differences and image separations. If dark halos
approximate singular isothermal spheres on galaxy scales and NFW profiles on
group/cluster scales, and are distributed in mass according to the
Press-Schechter theory, then about one every 12 SNe at z~1 will be magnified by
Delta m>0.1 mag (SCDM). The detection rate of SN Ia with magnification Delta
m>0.3 is estimated to be of order a few events per year per square degree at
maximum B-light and I<25, a hundred time smaller than the total rate expected
at these magnitude levels. In the field, events magnified by more than 0.75 mag
are 7 times less frequent: about one fifth of them gives rise to observable
multiple images. Because of the flat K-correction and wide luminosity function,
Type II SNe dominate the number counts at I>25 and have the largest fraction of
lensed objects. The optimal survey sensitivity for Type Ia's magnified by Delta
m>0.75 mag is I=23. Magnification bias increases their incidence by a factor of
50 in samples with I<22, dropping to a factor of 3.5 at 24 mag. At faint
magnitudes the enhancement is larger for SN II.

our attention on the observed Fourier frequency-dependent time delays between
hard and soft photons. We consider whether the observed time delays are:
created in the disk but are merely reprocessed by the corona; created by
differences between the hard and soft photon diffusion times in coronae with
extremely large radii; or are due to `propagation' of disturbances through the
corona. We find that the time delays are most likely created directly within
the corona; however, it is currently uncertain which specific model is the most
likely explanation. Models that posit a large coronal radius [or equivalently,
a large Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) region] do not fully address
all the details of the observed spectrum. The Compton corona models that do
address the full spectrum do not contain dynamical information. We show,
however, that simple phenomenological propagation models for the observed time
delays for these latter models imply extremely slow characteristic propagation
speeds within the coronal region.

This together with the red colour (B-K=5.4) suggest that our object is a
moderately obscured QSO (Av>3), in optical wavelengths. The ASCA data suggest a
hard spectrum, probably due to a large obscuring column, with a photon index of
1.93 (+0.62, -0.46), NH~10^23. The combined ASCA and ROSAT data again suggest a
heavily obscured spectrum (NH~10^23 or Av~100). In this picture, the ROSAT soft
X-ray emission may arise from electron scattering, in a similar fashion to
local Seyfert 1.9. Then, there is a large discrepancy between the moderate
reddening witnessed by the IR and the large X-ray absorbing column. This could
be possibly explained on the basis of e.g. high gas metallicities or assuming
that the X-ray absorbing column is inside the dust sublimation radius. An
alternative explanation can be obtained when we allow for variability between
the ROSAT and ASCA observations. Then the best fit spectrum is still flat, 1.35
(+0.16, -0.14), but with low intrinsic absorption in better agreement with the
IR data, while the ROSAT normalization is a factor of two below the ASCA
normalization. This object may be one of the bright examples of a type-II QSO
population at high redshift, previously undetected in optical surveys. The hard
X-ray spectrum of this object suggests that such a population could make a
substantial contribution to the X-ray background.

theory. We exploit this integrability to perform the computation at the SO(8)
invariant point. Terms breaking this symmetry can be treated systematically in
perturbation theory, leading to a model with the same qualitative features.
Using said correlators, we determine the optical conductivity, the single
particle spectral function, and the I-V curve for tunneling into the system
from an external lead. The frequency, \omega, dependent optical conductivity is
determined exactly for \omega < 3m (m being the fermion particle mass in the

followed by the onset of the particle-hole continuum. Similarly, we obtain the
exact single particle spectral function for energies less than 3m. The latter
possesses a delta function peak arising from single particle excitations,
together with a two particle continuum. The final quantity we compute is the
tunneling I-V curve to lowest non-vanishing order in the tunneling matrix
elements. For this quantity, we present exact results for voltages, V <

jump at the energy of the onset of tunneling into the continuum of two particle
states. All calculations are done through form-factor expansions of correlation
functions. Finite truncations of such expansions give exact closed form
expressions below given energy thresholds. To facilitate these calculations, we

the dominant EWP operators $Q_9$ and $Q_{10}$. Using flavor SU(3) symmetry, we
derive a set of model-independent relations between EWP contributions and
tree-level decay amplitudes one of which was noted recently by Neubert and
Rosner. Two new applications of these relations are demonstrated in which
uncertainties due to EWP corrections are eliminated in order to determine a
weak phase. Whereas the weak angle $\alpha$ can be obtained from $B\to\pi\pi$
free of hadronic uncertainties, a determination of $\gamma$ from $B^{0,\pm}\to
K\pi^{\pm}$ requires the knowledge of a ratio of certain tree-level hadronic
matrix elements. The smallness of this ratio implies a useful constraint on
$\gamma$ if rescattering can be neglected.

examples. We point out that in these neutrinoless modes, the GIM cancelation is
much milder with only a logarithmic behavior $\log (m_j /m_k)$ where $m_{j, k}$
are the neutrino masses. This is in sharp contrast with the vanishingly small
amplitude $\tau^{\pm}\to \mu^{\pm}+\gamma$ strongly suppressed by the quadratic
power $(m_j^2-m_k^2)/ M_{\rm W}^2$. In comparison with the hopelessly small
branching ratio B$(\tau^{\pm}\to \mu^{\pm}+\gamma)\approx 10^{-40}$, the
B$(\tau^{\pm}\to\mu^{\pm}+\ell^{+}+\ell^{-})$ could be larger than $10^{-14}$.
The latter mode, if measurable, could give one more constraint to the lepton
mixing angle $\sin 2\theta_{jk}$ and the neutrino mass ratio $m_j/m_k$, and
therefore is complementary to neutrino oscillation experiments.

theories is reviewed. History quantum theories provide a conceptual and
mathematical framework for formulating quantum theories without a globally
defined Hamiltonian time evolution and for introducing the concept of space
time event into quantum theory. On a mathematical level a history quantum
theory is characterized by the space of histories, which represent the space
time events, and by the space of decoherence functionals which represent the
quantum mechanical states in the history approach. The second part of this
paper is devoted to the study of the structure of the space of decoherence
functionals for some physically reasonable spaces of histories in some detail.
The temporal reformulation of standard Hamiltonian quantum theories suggests to
consider the case that the space of histories is given by (i) the lattice of
projection operators on some Hilbert space or -- slightly more general -- (ii)
the set of projection operators in some von Neumann algebra. In the case (i)
the conditions are identified under which decoherence functionals can be
represented by, respectively, trace class operators, bounded operators or
families of trace class operators on the tensor product of the underlying
Hilbert space by itself. Moreover we shall discuss the naturally arising
representations of decoherence functionals as sesquilinear forms. The paper
ends with a discussion of the consequences of the results for the general
axiomatic framework of history theories.
