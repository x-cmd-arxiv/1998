performed in recent years. They reached opposite conclusions concerning
possible binary excesses in some of these associations. I develop a consistent
method to reanalyze all these studies, so that I can compare all data

of five new companions to Taurus members.
  It appears that binary fraction in Taurus exceeds the main sequence value by
a factor of 1.7 in the range 4-2000 AU. The companion star fraction in this
separation range is the same as the overall main sequence fraction. Ophiuchus,
Chameleon, and possibly Lupus show similar excesses, although with lower
confidence levels. Binaries in Ophiuchus seem to have larger flux ratios
(towards faint companions) than in Taurus.
  It appears very unlikely that all very young star forming regions have binary
excesses. The binary fraction seems to be established after $\sim$ 1 Myr, but
the precise nature of the difference between various regions is still unclear
(overall binary fraction, orbital period distribution). It is not currently

comparing the depths of water vapor absorption bands in our candidate objects
with a grid of M dwarf standards, we derive spectral types which are
independent of reddening. Optical spectroscopy of one brown dwarf candidate
confirms the spectral type derived from the water bands. Combining their
spectral types with published near-infrared photometry, effective temperatures
and bolometric stellar luminosities are derived enabling us to place our sample
on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We compare the positions of the brown dwarf
candidates in this diagram with two sets of theoretical models in order to
estimate their masses and ages. Considering uncertainties in placing the
candidates in the H-R diagram, six objects consistently lie in the brown dwarf
regime and another five objects lie in the transition region between stellar
and substellar objects. The ages inferred for the sample are consistent with
those derived for higher mass association members. Three of the newly
identified brown dwarfs display infrared excesses at $\lambda$=2.2 $\mu$m
suggesting that young brown dwarfs can have active accretion disks. Comparing
our mass estimates of the brown dwarf candidates with those derived from
photometric data alone suggests that spectroscopy is an essential component of
investigations of the mass functions of young clusters.

interactions, connections among the red quasars, the BL Lacs, and the Blazars
with the gamma-ray bursts are discussed in the light of the ""hypernovae""
scenario. It is proposed that the gamma-ray bursts occur primarily in the star
formation regions in starburst environments, and arise from the core-collapse
of super-massive Wolf-Rayet stars, that are formed in interacting systems. In
this interacting environment star formations cause supernovae explosions. As
the stars explode, shock waves propagate outward and collide with the ambient
medium, forming a high-density super-shell, where intense star formation
begins; subsequently supernovae explosions within the shell cause an outward
expansion of the shell. In another scenario of star formation the interactions
among the large gas-rich low-surface brightness (LSB) spiral galaxies give rise
to fragmentation of their tidal tails. These fragmented clouds collapse to
compact dwarfs, which undergo rapid star formation. In such a scenario of
interactions, where most quasars are observed, we discuss the MgII absorption
lines in GRB 970508, whose spectra resemble a BL Lac object, and the spectral
evolution of GRB 971214 that may also indicate a similar connection. Beside the
BL Lac connection, the recent discovery of GRB 980425 in a nearby galaxy
indicates asymmetric supernovae explosions that give rise to relativistic jets.
We propose that the gamma-ray light curves arise due to inverse Compton
scattering of soft-photons from precessing relativistic blobs of plasma moving
in jets. This brings into light the mechanisms of supernova explosions, that
give birth to relativistic jets.

models of galaxy formation based on hierarchical Cold Dark Matter (CDM) type
models are in agreement with these direct observations and also with the
``fossil'' evidence contained in constraints on the ages of present day
early-type galaxies. Previous models predicted that the star formation rate
density falls off rather steeply at $z\ga 2$, and correspondingly that the
majority of the stars in the Universe formed at relatively low redshift. We
investigate the effect of including a bursting mode of star formation, assuming
that galaxy-galaxy mergers trigger starbursts and using the merger rate that
arises naturally in the CDM merging hierarchy. The resulting starbursts
substantially increase the global star formation rate at high redshift, leading
to predictions that are in good agreement with the star formation rate density
at $z\sim3$ obtained from sub-millimeter observations (SCUBA) and optical/UV
estimates after correction for dust extinction. The mass of stars formed at $z
\ge 3$ is correspondingly in better agreement with the fossil evidence. We also
investigate complementary global quantities such as the mass of cold gas and
the average metallicity of cold gas as a function of redshift, and the
integrated extra-galactic background light. We argue that these observations,
taken together, provide strong constraints on the star formation history of the
Universe, and that hierarchical models of the CDM type are in reasonable
agreement with these observations when starbursts are included.

positive and linear in field, indicating that the anomalous contribution $R_S$
is negligible. However, the effective carrier density in a free electron model
is n_{eff}=2.4 holes/Mn, even larger than the 0.85-1.9 holes/Mn reported for
thin-films and far larger than the 0.33 holes/Mn expected from the doping

appears, that we ascribe to R_S. Using detailed magnetization data, we separate
the ordinary (\propto B) and anomalous (\propto M) contributions. Below T_C,
R_S \propto rho_{xx}, indicating that magnetic skew scattering is the dominant
mechanism in the metallic ferromagnetic regime. At and above the
resistivity-peak temperature, we find that rho_{xy}/rho_{xx}M is a constant,
independent of temperature and field. This implies that the anomalous Hall

National Laboratory (BNL), Heavy Ion Physics will enter a new energy regime.
The question is whether the signatures proposed for the discovery of a phase
transition from hadronic matter to a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), that were
established on the basis of collisions at the BEVALAC, the AGS, and the SPS,
respectively, are still useful and detectable at these high incident energies.
In the past two decades, measurements related to strangeness formation in the
collision were advocated as potential signatures and were tested in numerous
fixed target experiments at the AGS and the SPS. In this article I will review
the capabilities of the RHIC detectors to measure various aspects of
strangeness, and I will try to answer the question whether the information
content of those measurements is comparable to the one at lower energies.

LHC (in its heavy ion mode) at CERN/Geneva, one aims at detecting a new form of
hadronic matter --- the Quark Gluon Plasma. We discuss here a complementary
aspect of these collisions, the very peripheral ones. Due to coherence, there
are strong electromagnetic fields of short duration in such collisions. They
give rise to photon-photon and photon-nucleus collisions with high flux up to
an invariant mass region hitherto unexplored experimentally. After a general
survey photon-photon luminosities in relativistic heavy ion collisions are
discussed. Then photon-photon physics at various gamma-gamma-invariant mass
scales is discussed. The region of several GeV, relevant for RHIC is dominated
by QCD phenomena (meson and vector meson pair production). Invariant masses of
up to about 100 GeV can be reached at LHC, and the potential for new physics is
discussed. Lepton-pair production, especially electron-positron pair production
is copious. Due to the strong fields there will be new phenomena, especially
multiple e+e- pair production.

Beginning with definitions and motivations of the approach, we demonstrate that
all quark and gluon Feynman diagrams are organized into classes based on powers
of 1/N_c. We then show that this result can be translated into definite
statements about mesons and baryons containing arbitrary numbers of
constituents. In the mesons, numerous well-known phenomenological properties
follow as immediate consequences of simply counting powers of N_c, while for
the baryons, quantitative large N_c analyses of masses and other properties are
seen to agree with experiment, even when ``large'' N_c is set equal to its
observed value of 3. Large N_c reasoning is also used to explain some simple
features of nuclear interactions.

and chemical equilibrium is considered. A plasma with a self-consistent
evolving parton-parton interaction strength is shown to equilibrate better and
faster than the usual but inconsistent one with a fixed strength. We explain
why as a consequence of this, a parton plasma is a unique kind of many-body
system. Because our time evolution scheme does not require the plasma to be in
either kind of equilibrium from the outset, out-of-equilibrium effect on
particle productions can be revealed. We show this on photon production and
discuss the implications on photon as a signal to detect the quark-gluon
plasma.

temporal coding. The foundation of the approach is the construction of several
families of novel distances (metrics) between neuronal impulse trains. In
contrast to most previous approaches to the analysis of temporal coding, the
present approach does not attempt to embed impulse trains in a vector space,
and does not assume a Euclidean notion of distance. Rather, the proposed
metrics formalize physiologically-based hypotheses for what aspects of the
firing pattern might be stimulus-dependent, and make essential use of the point
process nature of neural discharges. We show that these families of metrics
endow the space of impulse trains with related but inequivalent topological
structures. We show how these metrics can be used to determine whether a set of
observed responses have stimulus-dependent temporal structure without a
vector-space embedding. We show how multidimensional scaling can be used to
assess the similarity of these metrics to Euclidean distances. For two of these
families of metrics (one based on spike times and one based on spike
intervals), we present highly efficient computational algorithms for
calculating the distances. We illustrate these ideas by application to
artificial datasets and to recordings from auditory and visual cortex.

there is a transition from a single condensate to a fragmented condensate as
the strength of the central barrier of the potential is increased. We determine
the nature of this transition through approximate analytic as well as numerical
solutions of our model in the regime where the inter-particle interactions can
be treated perturbatively. The degree of fragmentation of the condensate is
characterized by the degrees of first-order and second-order spatial coherence
across the barrier.
