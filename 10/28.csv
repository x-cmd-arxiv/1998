\lsim 4$) of the observed optical and X-ray quasar luminosity functions (LFs),
with the following assumptions: (i) the mass-function of dark matter halos
follows the Press-Schechter theory, (ii) the black hole (BH) mass scales
linearly with the halo mass, (iii) quasars have a constant universal lifetime,
and (iv) a thin accretion disk provides the optical luminosity of quasars,
while the X-ray/optical flux ratio is calibrated from a sample of observed
quasars. The mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ onto quasar BHs is a free parameter
of the models, that we constrain using the observed LFs. The accretion rate
$\dot M$ inferred from either the optical or X-ray data under these assumptions
generally decreases as a function of cosmic time from $z \simeq 4$ to $z \simeq
0$. We find that a comparable accretion rate is inferred from the X-ray and
optical LF only if the X-ray/optical flux ratio decreases with BH mass. Near
$z\simeq 0$, $\dot M$ drops to substantially sub-Eddington values at which
advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) exist. Such a decline of $\dot M$,
possibly followed by a transition to radiatively inefficient ADAFs, could
explain both the absence of bright quasars in the local universe and the
faintness of accreting BHs at the centers of nearby galaxies. We argue that a
decline of the accretion rate of the quasar population is indeed expected in
cosmological structure formation models.

additional conclusions concerning anomalous gravitational effects in the
universe are derived. For systems with spherical mass distribution and high
central density of the luminous matter, abnormal increases in the gravitational
potential towards the centers of these systems are derived. These anomalous
increases are calculated on the basis of the amount and distribution of the
observed luminous matter. For spiral galaxies, the calculation yields the
astonishing result that the anomalous part of the gravitational potential is
not produced by the large mass of the spiral system but by the small mass of
the central bulge. A noticeable anomalous increase can only be expected close
to the center, e.g. in the innermost region with a diameter on the order of
only 1 pc in a bulge with a radius of 500 pc. Experimental observations are
cited reporting such anomalous gravitational effects in the four spherical
systems considered: globular star clusters, the bulges of spiral galaxies,
elliptical galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. Conventionally, on the basis of
Newtonian Mechanics and the amount of luminous matter, these effects are
unexpected. They are most commonly explained by assuming the existence of
appropriate large black holes or a sufficient amount of dark matter.

PSR 1929+10 and PSR 0950+08 (ages of $3\times 10^6$ and $2\times 10^7$ yr,

heat source is friction between the neutron star crust and the superfluid it is
thought to contain. We study the effects of superfluid friction on the
long-term thermal and rotational evolution of a neutron star. Differential
rotation velocities between the superfluid and the crust (averaged over the
inner crust moment of inertia) of $\bar\omega\sim 0.6$ rad s$^{-1}$ for PSR
1929+10 and $\sim 0.02$ rad s$^{-1}$ for PSR 0950+08 would account for their
observed temperatures. These differential velocities could be sustained by
pinning of superfluid vortices to the inner crust lattice with strengths of
$\sim$ 1 MeV per nucleus. Pinned vortices can creep outward through thermal
fluctuations or quantum tunneling. For thermally-activated creep, the coupling
between the superfluid and crust is highly sensitive to temperature. If pinning
maintains large differential rotation ($\sim 10$ rad s$^{-1}$), a feedback
instability could occur in stars younger than $\sim 10^5$ yr causing
oscillations of the temperature and spin-down rate over a period of $\sim 0.3
t_{\rm age}$. For stars older than $\sim 10^6$ yr, however, vortex creep occurs
through quantum tunneling, and the creep velocity is too insensitive to
temperature for a thermal-rotational instability to occur. These older stars
could be heated through a steady process of superfluid friction.

The ions Al III and S III trace heavily depleted and non-depleted elements,

the ionization correction relating N(Al III)/N(S III) to the gas-phase
abundance [Al/S]_i in the ionized gas. For spectral types considered here, the
corrections are small and independent of the assumed ionization parameter.
Using the results of these photoionization models, we find [Al/S]_i = -1.0 in
the ionized gas towards three disk stars. These values of [Al/S]_i (=[Al/H]_i)
imply that Al-bearing grains are present in the ionized nebulae around these
stars. If the WIM of the Galaxy is photoionized by OB stars, our data for two
halo stars imply [Al/S]_i = -0.4 to -0.5 in the WIM and thus the presence of
dust grains containing Al in this important phase of the ISM. While
photoionization appears to be the most likely origin of the ionization for Al
III and S III, we cannot rule out confusion from the presence of hot,
collisionally ionized gas along two sightlines. We find that [Al/S]_i in the
ionized gas along the six sightlines is anti-correlated with the electron
density and average sightline neutral density. The degree of grain destruction
in the ionized medium of the Galaxy is not much higher than in the warm neutral
medium. The existence of grains in the ionized regions studied here has
important implications for the thermal balance of these regions. (Abstract

which to model the sub-millimetre emission. Several arguments then point to the

both the 6.4 keV iron line and a strong reflection hump, produced by the

1.8) reflected at high energies by material with a fairly large covering factor
(\Omega/2\pi~1). The iron line is intrinsically narrow ($\sigma=73(+207,-73)
eV) and has an equivalent width of ~140$ eV. We discuss the results in the
context of current models for AGNs and suggest that the primary X-ray power law
continuum is probably produced by a hot inner flow, while the reprocessed
radiation comes from an outer cold thin disk, and/or from a thick torus at even
larger radii. Further observations with BeppoSAX could distinguish between the
latter two cases. Beamed radiation associated to the radio jet is unlikely to
contribute significantly to the X-ray emission. Finally, an historical study of
the column density NH, also reported here, shows that the absorption along the
line of sight changes in time. The NH time variability, which is not correlated
with that of the primary continuum, seems to imply variations of the geometry
of the absorber rather than variations in the ionization state of the gas.

driven by mass accretion onto the outskirts of halos and can be characterized

energy transfer are studied: the energy fluxes, and the energy transfer between
different wavenumber regions ({\it shells}). The picture of energy fluxes that
emerges is quite complex - there is a forward cascade of magnetic energy, an
inverse cascade of kinetic energy, a flux of energy from the kinetic to the
magnetic field, and a reverse flux which transfers the energy back to the
kinetic from the magnetic. The energy transfer between different wave number
shells is also complex - local and nonlocal transfers often possess opposing
features, i.e., energy transfer between some wave number shells occurs from
kinetic to magnetic, and between other wave number shells this transfer is
reversed. The net transfer of energy is from kinetic to magnetic. The results
obtained from the flux studies and the shell-to-shell energy transfer studies
are consistent with each other.
