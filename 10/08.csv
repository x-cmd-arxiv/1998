important, and the externally imposed angular momentum reversal timescale
governs the flow. In this outer region the disk is split into concentric rings

NGC4286, and IC3475. Based on previous broadband imaging and HI studies, these
mixed-morphology galaxies were proposed by Sandage & Hoffman (1991) to be,
respectively, a gas-rich low surface brightness Im dwarf, a nucleated dwarf
that has lost most of its gas and is in transition from Im to dS0,N, and the
prototypical example of a gas-poor ``huge low surface brightness'' early-type
galaxy. From the combination of our broadband and Halpha imaging with the
published information on the neutral gas content of these three galaxies, we
find that (1) NGC3377A is a dwarf spiral; (2) NGC3377A and NGC4286 have
comparable amounts of ongoing star formation, as indicated by their Halpha
emission, while IC3475 has no detected HII regions to a very low limit; (3) the
global star formation rates are at least a factor of 20 below that of 30
Doradus for NGC3377A and NGC4286; (4) while the amount of star formation is
comparable, the distribution of star forming regions is very different between
NGC3377A and NGC4286; (5) given their current star formation rates and gas
contents, both NGC3377A and NGC4286 can continue to form stars for more than a
Hubble time; (6) both NGC3377A and NGC4286 have integrated total B-R colors
that are redder than the integrated total B-R color for IC3475, and thus it is
unlikely that either galaxy will ever evolve into an IC3475 counterpart; and
(7) IC3475 is too blue to be a dE. We thus conclude that we have not identified
potential precursors to galaxies such as IC3475, and unless signifcant changes
occur in the star formation rates, neither NGC3377A nor NGC4286 will evolve
into a dwarf elliptical or dwarf spheroidal within a Hubble time.

$W_n\sim L^{\alpha_n}$ obey power counting, $\alpha_n= n \alpha$, and the
amplitude ratio's of the moments are universal. They have the same values in

star operation P*Q, obtained by restricting the first argument to be a sum of
atomic actions. It generalizes prefix iteration, in which the first argument is
a single action. Complete finite equational axiomatizations are given for five
notions of bisimulation congruence over basic CCS with flat iteration, viz.
strong congruence, branching congruence, eta-congruence, delay congruence and
weak congruence. Such axiomatizations were already known for prefix iteration
and are known not to exist for general iteration. The use of flat iteration has
two main advantages over prefix iteration: 1.The current axiomatizations
generalize to full CCS, whereas the prefix iteration approach does not allow an
elimination theorem for an asynchronous parallel composition operator. 2.The
greater expressiveness of flat iteration allows for much shorter completeness
proofs.
  In the setting of prefix iteration, the most convenient way to obtain the
completeness theorems for eta-, delay, and weak congruence was by reduction to
the completeness theorem for branching congruence. In the case of weak
congruence this turned out to be much simpler than the only direct proof found.
In the setting of flat iteration on the other hand, the completeness theorems
for delay and weak (but not eta-) congruence can equally well be obtained by
reduction to the one for strong congruence, without using branching congruence
as an intermediate step. Moreover, the completeness results for prefix
iteration can be retrieved from those for flat iteration, thus obtaining a
second indirect approach for proving completeness for delay and weak congruence
in the setting of prefix iteration.

Furthermore, any object travelling within the lightcones of the weak
gravitational field is similarly delayed with respect to the minimum traversal
time possible in the background Minkowski geometry.

energy source present in stellar energy producing regions. I consider the
conjectures of the derived model for the solar neutrino fluxes in case of a
solar core allowed to vary in relation to the surface activity cycle. The
observed neutrino flux data suggest a solar core possibly varying in time. In
the dynamic solar model the quiet and runaway energy sources together may
produce quasi-constant flux in the SuperKamiokande because it is sensitive to
neutral currents, axions and anti-neutrinos, too. I calculate the contributions
of the runaway source to the individual neutrino detectors. The results of the
dynamic solar core model suggest that since the HOMESTAKE detects mostly the
high energy electron neutrinos, therefore the HOMESTAKE data may aniticorrelate
with the activity cycle. Activity correlated changes are expected to be present
only marginally in the GALLEX and GNO data. The gallium detectors are sensitive
mostly to the pp neutrinos, and the changes of the pp neutrinos arising from
the SSM-like core is mostly compensated by the high-energy electron neutrinos
produced by the hot bubbles of the dynamic energy source. The results suggest
that the GALLEX data may show an anti-correlation, while the SuperKamiokande
data may show a correlation with the activity cycle. Predictions of the dynamic
solar model are presented for the SNO and Borexino experiments which can
distinguish between the effects of the MSW mechanism and the consequences of
the dynamic solar model. The results of the dynamic solar model are consistent
with the present heioseismic measurements and can be checked with future
heioseismic measurements as well.

spectrum and the mixing angles of the hadronic sector. In the context of the
supersymmetric unified theories, they further imply a non-trivial mass
structure for the scalar partners, giving rise to new sources of flavor
violation. In the present work, lepton flavor non-conserving processes are
examined in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model augmented
by a U(1)-family symmetry. We calculate the mixing effects on the \mu-> e\gamma
and \tau -> \mu\gamma rare decays. All supersymmetric scalar masses involved in
the processes are determined at low energies using two loop renormalization
group analysis and threshold corrections. Further, various novel effects are
considered and found to have important impact on the branching ratios. Thus, a
rather interesting result is that when the see-saw mechanism is applied in the
(12 X 12)-sneutrino mass matrix, the mixing effects of the Dirac matrix in the
effective light sneutrino sector are canceled at first order. In this class of
models and for the case that soft term mixing is already present at the GUT
scale, tau -> \mu \gamma decays are mostly expected to arise at rates
significantly smaller than the current experimental limits. On the other hand,
the $\mu \ra e \gamma$ rare decays impose important bounds on the model
parameters, particularly on the supersymmetric scalar mass spectrum. In the
absence of soft term mixing at high energies, the predicted branching ratios
for rare decays are, as expected, well below the experimental bounds.

The infalling classical fields do not play any role but the quantum back
reaction is crucial in the formation of the AdS vacuum and AdS black hole. In
the presence of the AdS black hole, there does not exist any radiation, which
is consistent with the constraint equations. Therefore the transition from the
