observed 3 square arcminutes and detected one emission line candidate object in
the field around PC 1109+4642. We discuss the possibilities that this object is
a star-forming galaxy at the QSO redshift, z_em=3.313 or a Seyfert galaxy. In
the former case, we infer a star formation rate of 170 Msun/yr for this
Kprime=21.3 object. The galaxy has a compact but resolved morphology, with a
FWHM=0.6arcs, or 4.2kpc at z=3.313 (H_0=50 km/s/Mpc and q_0=0.5). The comoving
density of such objects in QSO environments appears to be 0.0033Mpc^3,
marginally lower (<= 3sigma) than the density observed for Halpha-emitters in
absorption-line fields at z~2.5, but similar to the density of Lyman Break
Galaxies at z~3. If on the other hand, most of the line emission is [OIII] from
a Seyfert 2 nucleus at z=3.31, then the high inferred volume density could
imply a large evolution in the Seyfert 2 luminosity function from the current
epoch. We find the field containing the object to also contain many faint
extended objects in the Kprime image, but little significant excess over the
expected number-magnitude relation. We discuss the implication of the emission
line being a longer wavelength line at a lower redshift.

companion star orbiting in a plane inclined to the disk. We consider m=1
perturbations with odd symmetry with respect to the z=0 midplane. Since the
response of a viscous disk is not in phase with the perturbing potential, a
tidal torque is exerted on the disk, resulting in a decrease of its angular
momentum. This tidal torque is found to be comparable to the horizontal viscous
stress acting on the background flow when the perturbed velocities in the disk
are on the order of the sound speed. If these velocities remain subsonic, the
tidal torque can exceed the horizontal viscous stress only if the viscous
parameter \alpha which couples to the vertical shear is larger than that
coupled to the horizontal shear. In protostellar disks, bending waves are found
to propagate deep into the disk inner parts. If the waves are reflected at the
center, resonances occur when the frequency of the tidal waves is equal to that
of some free normal global bending mode of the disk. If such resonances exist,
tidal interactions may then be important even when the binary separation is
large. Out of resonance, the torque associated with the secular perturbation is
generally much larger than that associated with the finite frequency
perturbations. As long as the waves are damped before they reach the center,
the torque associated with the finite frequency perturbations does not depend
on the viscosity. These calculations are relevant to disks around young stars
and maybe also to disks in X-ray binary systems. (abridged)

redshift-space correlation function xi(s) for the whole magnitude-limited

Mpc, where it smoothly breaks down, crossing the zero value on scales as large
as ~80/h Mpc. On smaller scales (0.2-2/h Mpc), the slope is shallower, mostly
due to redshift-space depression by virialized structures. This effect is found
to be enhanced by the J3 optimal-weighting estimator for xi. We explicitly
evidence these effects by computing xi(r_p,pi) and the projected function
w_p(r_p). In this way we recover the real-space correlation function xi(r),
which we fit below 10/h Mpc with a power-law model. This gives a reasonable
fit, with r_o=4.15^{+0.20}_{-0.21} /h Mpc and \gamma=1.67^{+0.07}_{-0.09}. This
results on xi(r) and xi(s), and the comparison with other surveys, clearly

corresponding to a steepening of P(k) near the turnover.

are obtained by combining a soft thermal component with a hard powerlaw. The
hard component may be either seen directly or can be explained by scattering of
the AGN powerlaw at circumnuclear warm high-column-density gas. A compilation
of the multi-wavelength properties of NGC 1365 and comparison with hard X-ray
selected AGNs shows that the hard component of NGC 1365 is too faint compared
to its broad Balmer line components challenging simple unified models.
According to analytical estimates, supernova driven outflow can fully account
for the X-ray luminosity in the Raymond-Smith component if the observed IR
emission is mainly provided by the central starburst. We do not find obvious
optical counterparts for three faint PSPC sources south of the nucleus. In
particular, there is no coincidence with the two supernovae reported in NGC
1365.
  With the ROSAT HRI data, we have precisely located the extraordinary
southwest X-ray source NGC1365-X1 which falls on one of the subordinate spiral
arms. The source is found to be highly variable (a factor about 10) on the
timescale of months. Intrinsic to NGC 1365, its huge luminosity makes it
exceptional among stellar X-ray sources. At present, the most likely
interpretation seems to be an ultra-powerful X-ray binary.

on the sky: A low-power radio source at a similar redshift (z=0.065) to the GPS

70 mJy between 1994 and 1997. We have also retrieved and analysed unpublished
archival ROSAT HRI data of B1144+352. The source has been detected and appears

guarantee reliability is the use of robust design styles, e.g.,
delay-insensitivity. For early timing evaluation two aspects must be
considered: a) The timing needs to be proportional to technology variations and
b) the implemented architecture should be identical for prototype and target.
The first can be met also by delay-insensitive implementation. The latter one
is the key point. A unified architecture is needed for prototyping as well as
implementation. Our new approach to rapid prototyping of signal processing
tasks is based on a configurable, delay-insensitive implemented processor
called Flysig. In essence, the Flysig processor can be understood as a complex
FPGA where the CLBs are substituted by bit-serial operators. In this paper the
general concept is detailed and first experimental results are given for

the existence of a certain representation of the gauge group associated to the

new topic and its study may shed light on basic problems of nuclear dynamics.
For instance, it is known that nuclear structure calculations are not able, as
a rule, to account completely for the empirical single-particle damping. In
this contribution, we present calculations of the single-particle self-energy
in the case of the neutron-rich light nucleus $^{28}$O, by taking proper care
of the continuum, and we show that there are important differences with the
case of nuclei along the valley of stability.

discussed for the case when velocity and acceleration are directed along the
rod's length. The discussion includes the case of a time-dependent force
applied to a single point, as well as a time-independent force arbitrary
distributed along the rod.
  The time dependence of the rod's relativistic length depends on the
application point of the force, but after the termination of acceleration the
final velocity and length do not depend on it. An observer on a uniformly
accelerated rod feels an inertial force which decreases in the direction of
acceleration. The influence of non-rigidity of realistic rods on our results is
qualitatively discussed.

presented. It is pointed out that since the experiment measures, not the
noncyclic phase itself, but a quantity derived from it, it misses the most
interesting feature of such a phase, namely the different sign associated with
states lying in the upper and the lower hemispheres, a feature originating in
the existence of a phase singularity. Such effects have earlier been predicted
and seen in optical interference experiments using polarization of light as the
spinor [Bhandari, Phys.Rep.281, 1 (Mar 1997)].

framework, which applies to 1D quantum spin chains, 2D statistical lattice
models (vertex models) and relativistic field theories with 1 space dimension
and 1 time dimension. The connection with quantum groups is expounded. Several
applications are then presented. Finite size corrections are calculated via two
methods: The Non-Linear Integral Equations, which are applied to the study of
the states of the affine Toda model with imaginary coupling, and their
interpolation between the high energy (ultra-violet) and low energy (infra-red)
regions; and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz Equations, along with the
associated Fusion Equations, which are used to determine the thermodynamic
properties of the generalized multi-channel Kondo model. The latter is then
studied in more detail, still using the Bethe Ansatz and quantum groups, so as
to characterize the spectrum of the low energy excitations.
