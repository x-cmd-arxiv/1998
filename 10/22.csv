binaries (black hole candidates, atoll sources, the recently discovered
millisecond X-ray pulsar, and Z sources) at their lowest inferred mass
accretion rates. At these accretion rates, the power spectra of all sources are
dominated by a strong band-limited noise component, which follows a power law
with an index roughly 1 at high frequencies and breaks at a frequency between
0.02 and 32 Hz below which the spectrum is relatively flat. Superimposed on
this, a broad bump (sometimes a quasi-periodic oscillation) is present with a
0.2-67 Hz centroid frequency that varies in good correlation with the frequency
of the break. The black hole candidates and the low-luminosity neutron star
systems (including the millisecond X-ray pulsar) have the same relation between
the frequency of the bump and the frequency of the break. These similar
characteristics strongly suggest that in all those different types of sources
the band-limited noise and the bump are produced by the same physical
mechanism. This mechanism cannot then depend on the presence or absence of
either a small magnetosphere or a solid surface, so that it is most likely
related to an instability in the flow in the accretion disk that modulates the
accretion rate.
  The Z sources, which are more luminous than the other sources discussed here,
follow a similar, but slightly shifted correlation between the break frequency
and the frequency of the bump. The data suggest that the band-limited noise in
Z sources is more complex than that in the other sources.

the fully relativistic regime, we present here first results concerning the
evolution of matter accreting supersonically onto a rotating (Kerr) black hole.
These computations generalize previous results where the non-rotating
(Schwarzschild) case was extensively considered. We parametrize our initial
data by the asymptotic conditions for the fluid and explore the dependence of
the solution on the angular momentum of the black hole. Towards quantifying the
robustness of our numerical results, we use two different geometrical
foliations of the black hole spacetime, the standard form of the Kerr metric in
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates as well as its Kerr-Schild form, which is free of
coordinate singularities at the black hole horizon. We demonstrate some
important advantages of using such horizon adapted coordinate systems.
  Our numerical study indicates that regardless of the value of the black hole
spin the final accretion pattern is always stable, leading to constant
accretion rates of mass and momentum. The flow is characterized by a strong
tail shock, which, unlike the Schwarzschild case, is increasingly wrapped
around the central black hole as the hole angular momentum increases. The
rotation induced asymmetry in the pressure field implies that besides the well
known drag, the black hole will experience also a lift normal to the flow
direction. This situation exhibits some analogies with the Magnus effect of
classical fluid dynamics.

The power series converges for all $\bar B$, and for the special case that the

to a tabulated function of the magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$ and the ratio
$\beta$ of $\bar B$ (in velocity units) to the rms turbulent velocity $v_0$.
For $\beta\to 0$ (linear regime) we recover the results of Steenbeck et al.

astrophysical case, $\alpha$ starts to decrease at $\beta \sim 1$, dropping

extragalactic jets are produced by magnetized accretion disk coronae in the
ergospheres of rotating black holes. While the jets are produced in the
accretion disk itself, the output power still is an increasing function of the
black hole angular momentum. For high enough spin, the black hole triggers the
magnetic switch, producing highly-relativistic, kinetic-energy-dominated jets
instead of Poynting-flux-dominated ones for lower spin. The coronal mass
densities needed to trigger the switch at the observed FR break power are quite
small ($\sim 10^{-15} g cm^{-3}$), implying that the source of the jet material
may be either a pair plasma or very tenuous electron-proton corona, not the
main accretion disk itself.
  The model explains the differences in morphology and Mach number between FR I
and II sources and the observed trend for massive galaxies to undergo the FR
I/II transition at higher radio power. It also is consistent with the energy
content of extended radio lobes and explains why, because of black hole
spindown, the space density of FR II sources should evolve more rapidly than
that of FR I sources.
  If the present model is correct, then the ensemble average speed of
parsec-scale jets in sources distinguished by their FR I morphology (not
luminosity) should be distinctly slower than that for sources with FR II
morphology. The model also suggests the existence of a population of
high-redshift, sub-mJy FR I and II radio sources associated with spiral or
pre-spiral galaxies that flared once when their black holes were formed but
were never again re-kindled by mergers.

distinguish BHCs from low mass NSs have been explained in terms of event
horizons. Serious consideration of the possibility that they might simply be
massive NSs opens an avenue for proof of event horizons by negation, but
requires the use of a space-time metric that has no event horizon. The Yilmaz
exponential metric used here is shown to have an innermost marginally stable
orbit with radius, binding energy and Keplerian frequency that are within a few
percent of the same quantities for the Schwarzschild metric. A maximum NS mass
of ~10 solar mass is found for the Yilmaz metric. The two metrics essentially

between luminosity, temperature and redshift predicted by these models. Here we
show that these discrepancies arise because, near the centre, the entropy of
the hot, diffuse intracluster medium (ICM) is higher tha$ achievable through
gravitational collapse, indicating substantial non-gravitational heating of the
ICM. We estimate this excess entropy for the first time, and argue that it
represents a relic of the energetic winds through which forming galaxies
polluted the ICM with metals. Energetically, this is onl$ possible if the ICM
is heated at modest redshift ($z \ltsim 2$) but prior to cluster collapse,
indicating that the formation of galaxies precedes that of clusters and that
most clusters have been assembled very recently.

estimates that hyperons appear in neutron star matter at about twice the
nuclear saturation density, and emphasis is placed on effects that can be
attributed to the general multi-species composition of the matter, hence being
only weakly dependent on the specific modeling of strong interactions. Our
analysis indicates that hyperon formation not only softens the equation of
state but also severely constrains its values at high densities.
Correspondingly, the valid range for the maximum neutron star mass is limited
to about 1.5-1.8 $M_\odot$, which is a much narrower range than available when
hyperon formation is ignored. Effects concerning neutron star radii and
rotational evolution are suggested, and we demonstrate that the effect of
hyperons on the equation of state allows a reconciliation of observed pulsar
glitches with a low neutron star maximum mass. We discuss the effects hyperons
may have on neutron star cooling rates, including recent results which indicate
that hyperons may also couple to a superfluid state in high density matter. We
compare nuclear matter to matter with hyperons and show that once hyperons
accumulate in neutron star matter they reduce the likelihood of a meson
condensate, but increase the susceptibility to baryon deconfinement, which
could result in a mixed baryon-quark matter phase.

state-dependent dissipation term which fixes one global quantity. The principle
states that the mean values of properly chosen observables are the same for

Gallavotti and Cohen is applied to hydrodynamics, leading to the conjecture
that entropy fluctuations in the GNS system verify a relation first observed in
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. We tested these ideas in the case of
two-dimensional fluids. We examined the fluctuations of global quadratic

these small entropy differences, we have implemented two different

crystals with different stacking sequences. Recent work had demonstrated that
the fcc stacking has higher entropy than the hcp stacking. We have studied
other stackings to demonstrate that the fcc stacking does indeed have the
highest entropy of ALL possible stackings. The entropic interactions we could
detect involve three, four and (although with less statistical certainty) five
consecutive layers of spheres. These interlayer entropic interactions fall off
in strength with increasing distance, as expected; this fall-off appears to be
much slower near the melting density than at the maximum (close-packing)

determined by couplings to two Chern-Simons gauge fields. In addition there is
a $\sigma$-model field, $\mh$, which is necessary both to preserve the
Chern-Simons gauge symmetry that determines the correlations in the ground
state, and the global SU(2) invariance related to spin rotations. For states
with non zero polarization, the low energy dynamics is that of a ferromagnet.
In addition to spin waves, the spectrum contains topological solitons, or
skyrmions, just as in the fully polarized case. The electric charge of the
skyrmions is given by $Q_{el}=\nu P Q_{top}$, where $\nu$ is the filling
fraction, $P$ the magnitude of the polarization, and $Q_{top}$ the topological
charge. For the special case of full polarization, the theory involves a single
scalar field and a single Chern-Simons field in addition to the $\sigma$-model
field, $\mh$. We also give a heuristic derivation of the model lagrangians for
both full and partial polarization, and show that in a mean field picture, the
field $\mh$ is necessary in order to take into account the Berry phases

reconstruction takes place, this picture explains the Fibonacci-sequence of the
step heights as well as the related structure in the terraces qualitatively and
to certain extent even quantitatively. Furthermore, this layer-picture requires
that the polytopes are cut in order to allow for the observed step heights. We
conclude that Bergman or Mackay clusters have to be considered as geometric
building blocks of the i-AlPdMn structure rather than as energetically stable
entities.

In this case, the visible radiation is much cooler than the central temperature
at the Schwarzschild radius, in contrast to the naive expectation for the
observable spectrum. We investigate these ideas more quantitatively by solving
the Boltzmann equation using the test particle method. We confirm that at least
two kinds of photospheres may form: a quark-gluon plasma for black holes of
mass M_{BH} < 5 times 10^{14} g and an electron-positron-photon plasma for
M_{BH} < 2 times 10^{12} g. The QCD photosphere extends from the black hole
horizon to a distance of 0.2--4.0 fm for 10^9 g < M_{BH} < 5 10^{14} g, at
which point quarks and gluons with average energy of order \Lambda_{QCD}
hadronize. The QED photosphere starts at a distance of approximately 700 black
hole radii and dissipates at about 400 fm, where the average energy of the
emitted electrons, positrons and photons is inversely proportional to the black
hole temperature, and significantly higher than was found by Heckler. The
consequences of these photospheres for the cosmic diffuse gamma ray and
antiproton backgrounds are discussed: bounds on the black hole contribution to
the density of the universe are slightly weakened.

produces a number of new structure functions. There exist 108 structure
functions and 22 ones even after integrating the cross section over the

compactification so that they are T dual. The novel point, as compared with an
earlier study of the type II case (hep-th/9707107), is the appearence of Wilson
lines. Using SO(17,1) transformations between the weight lattices reveals the
existence of an intermediate theory where T duality transformations are
disentangled from the internal symmetry. This intermediate theory corresponds
to a sort of twisted compactification of a novel type. Its modular invariance
follows from an interesting interplay between three representations of the
modular group.

complex T is called a tilting complex. When B = A the isomorphism classes of
tilting complexes T form the derived Picard group DPic(A).
  We prove that when the algebra A is either local or commutative, then any
derived Morita equivalent algebra B is actually Morita equivalent. So we can
compute DPic(A) in these cases.
  Assume A is noetherian. Dualizing complexes over A were defined by the author
some years ago. These are complexes of bimodules which generalize the
commutative definition of Grothendieck. We prove that the group DPic(A)
classifies the set of isomorphism classes of dualizing complexes.

Kreines this result is generalized to upper triangular n x n matrices, and it
