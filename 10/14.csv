and redshift of classical double radio sources from three complete samples
selected at successively fainter low radio-frequency flux-limits. We have been
able to decouple the effects of the tight correlation between redshift and
luminosity (inherent in any single flux-limited sample) which have hitherto
hindered interpretation of the relationships between these four source
properties. The major trends found are that (i) spectral indices increase with
linear size, (ii) rest-frame spectral indices have a stronger dependence on
luminosity than on redshift except at high (GHz) frequencies, and that (iii)
the linear sizes are smaller at higher redshifts. We reproduce the observed
dependences in a model for radio sources (born throughout cosmic time according
to a radio-source birth function) whose lobes are fed with a
synchrotron-emitting population (whose energy distribution is governed by
compact hotspots), and which suffer inverse Compton, synchrotron and adiabatic
expansion losses. In simulating the basic observed dependences, we find that
there is no need to invoke any systematic change in the environments of these
objects with redshift if the consequences of imposing a survey flux-limit on
our simulated datasets are properly included in the model. We present evidence
that for a radio survey there is an unavoidable `youth--redshift degeneracy',
even though radio sources are short-lived relative to the age of the Universe;
it is imperative to take this into account in studies which seemingly reveal
correlations of source properties with redshift such as the `alignment effect'.

Bezecourt et al. (1998a), we combine the new cluster mass model with a
spectrophotometric prescription for galaxy evolution to predict the arclets
number counts and redshift distribution in the HST image. In particular, the
ellipticity distribution of background sources is taken into account, in order
to properly estimate the statistical number and redshift distribution of
arclets. We show that the redshift distribution of arclets, and particularly
its high redshift tail can be used as a strong constraint to disentangle
different galaxy evolution scenario. A hierarchical model which includes a
number density evolution is favored by our analysis. Finally, we compute the
depletion curves in the faint galaxies number counts and discuss its wavelength

the characteristic density and the scale radius of halos are essentially
proportional, respectively, to the critical density of the universe and the
virial radius at the time of their formation. These two relations are
consistent with the following simple evolutionary picture. Violent relaxation
caused by major mergers rearrange the structure of halos leading to a universal
dimensionless density profile. Between major mergers, halos gradually grow
through the accretion of surrounding layers by keeping the central part steady
and only expanding their virial radius as the critical density of the universe
diminishes.

much as that of all the stars in the universe --- and permit higher
$\Omega_\nu$. The ``standard'' COBE-normalized critical-matter-density (i.e.,

But adding to CDM neutrinos with mass of about 5 eV, corresponding to

for structure formation. However, other recent data has begun to make the case
for $\Omega_m <~ 0.6$ fairly convincing. In light of all this new data, we
reconsider whether cosmology still provides evidence favoring neutrino mass of
a few eV in flat models with cosmological constant $\Omega_\Lambda = 1 -

Preliminary studies and telemetry allocation indicate the need of compressing
these data by a ratio of $c_r \simgt 10$. Here we present a study of entropy
for (correlated multi-Gaussian discrete) noise, showing how the optimal
compression $c_{r,opt}$, for a linearly discretized data set with
$N_{bits}=\log_2{N_{max}}$ bits is given by: $c_r \simeq
{N_{bits}/\log_2(\sqrt{2\pi e} ~\sigma_e/\Delta)}$, where $\sigma_e\equiv (det
C)^{1/2N}$ is some effective noise rms given by the covariance matrix $C$ and
$\Delta \equiv R / N_{max}$ is the digital resolution. This $\Delta$ only needs
to be as small as the instrumental white noise RMS: $\Delta \simeq \sigma_T
\simeq 2 mK$ (the nominal $\mu K$ pixel sensitivity will only be achieved after
averaging). Within the currently proposed $N_{bits}=16$ representation, a
linear analogue to digital converter (ADC) will allow the digital storage of a
large dynamic range of differential temperature $R= N_{max} \Delta $ accounting
for possible instrument drifts and instabilities (which could be reduced by
proper on-board calibration). A well calibrated signal will be dominated by
thermal (white) noise in the instrument: $\sigma_e \simeq \sigma_T$, which
could yield large compression rates $c_{r,opt} \simeq 8$. This is the maximum
lossless compression possible. In practice, point sources and $1/f$ noise will
produce $\sigma_e > \sigma_T$ and $c_{r,opt} < 8$. This strategy seems safer
than non-linear ADC or data reduction schemes (which could also be used at some
stage).

the VHE spectrum beyond 20 TeV gives a nearly model-independent lower limit of
the Lorentz factor of GRBs, as $\gamma \gtilde 500$. Furthermore, our model
gives the correct energy range and time variability of ordinary keV-MeV
gamma-rays of GRBs by synchrotron radiation of electrons. Therefore the VHE
bursts of GRBs strongly support the hypothesis that ultra high energy cosmic

gravitational potential of the deprojected COBE NIR bar and disk, complemented
by a central cusp and, in some models, an outer halo. These models generically
lead to four-armed spiral structure between corotation of the bar and the solar
circle; their large-scale morphology is not sensitive to the precise value of
the bar's pattern speed, to the orientation of the bar with respect to the
observer, and to whether or not the spiral arms carry mass.
  Our best model provides a coherent interpretation of many observed gas
dynamical features. Its four-armed spiral structure outside corotation
reproduces quantitatively the directions to the five main spiral arm tangents
at |l|<=60deg observed in a variety of tracers. The 3-kpc-arm is identified
with one of the model arms emanating from the ends of the bar, extending into
the corotation region. The model features an inner gas disk with a cusped orbit
shock transition to an x_2 orbit disk of radius R~150pc.
  The bar's corotation radius is fairly well--constrained at R_c=3.5 +/- 0.5
kpc. The best value for the orientation angle of the bar is probably 20-25deg,
but the uncertainty is large since no detailed quantitative fit to all features
in the observed lv-diagrams is yet possible. The Galactic terminal velocity
curve from HI and CO observations out to l=+/-45deg (=5 kpc) is approximately

than 1% of the primordial gas in such small scale structures cools and
collapses to sufficiently high densities to be available for primordial star
formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that the formation of very massive

quasi-stability on a time-scale much longer than the period of the comprising

based on our Quantum Field Theory (QFT) of the masseon and graviton particles
called ElectroMagnetic Quantum Gravity (EMQG, ref. 1). EMQG provides a
framework for understanding Newtonian Inertia as a pure QFT process involving
the photon as the vector boson exchange particle. Photons are exchanged between
the electrically charged masseon particles (which are the ultimate consistuents
of the fermion particles of ordinary matter, and contain electrical charge and
mass-charge) of an accelerated mass, and the electrically charged virtual
masseon particles of the quantum vacuum. The sum of all the tiny
electromagnetic forces contributed by each masseon particle of the mass from
the surrounding quantum vacuum is the source of the total inertial force of an
accelerated mass in Newton's F=MA. We found that gravity involves this same
process, where now the virtual masseons of the quantum vacuum are accelerated
by the graviton exchanges between the masseons in the earth (which have mass
charge) and the virtual masseons of the quantum vacuum (which also have mass
charge). Equivalence occurs because of the reversal of the roles of the quantum
vacuum and masseons in accelerated frames and under gravity. Equivalence is not
perfect. There is a tiny imbalance between gavitational mass and inertial mass
(in favor of gravity) caused by the direct graviton exchanges with the mass
(not present in inertial mass).

ambiguity of directly quantizing a constrained system is inherently
unresolvable. However, there is never any problem with a physical quantum
