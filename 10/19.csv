resolved, indicating optically thick thermalized emission, as expected for a
standard BLR. 2) Lines from ions of increasing ionization level show increasing
excess blue wing flux, and an increasing line peak velocity shift, suggesting
an out-flowing component of the BLR, visible only in the approaching direction,
where the ionization level increases with velocity. 3) A weak associated UV
absorption system is detected in N V, C IV, Si IV and Lya, which is probably
part of the outflow suggested above. 4) The C III] 1909 line indicates a BLR
density about an order of magnitude larger than commonly observed in quasars.
An additional denser component is implied by the Al III 1857 doublet. 5)
Prominent Fe II and FeIII emission is seen, including components which may
indicate significant Lya pumping of the 8-10 eV levels of Fe II. Further
studies suggest that some of the above properties are typical of narrow line
AGNs.

the Kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino efficiencies. Simulated deposition of
this energy in the polar regions results in strong relativistic outflow - jets
beamed to about 1.5% of the sky. The jets remain highly focused, and are
capable of penetrating the star in 5 - 10 s. After the jet breaks through the
surface of the star, highly relativistic flow can commence. Because of the
sensitivity of the mass ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum,

viewing angle, a large range of outcomes is possible ranging from bright GRBs
like GRB 971214 to faint GRB-supernovae like SN 1998bw. X-ray precursors are
also possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. While only a small

GRBs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to make in this model.

pressure-confined by the surrounding, hot, X-ray emitting gas. The cold clouds
could remain relatively static until they are destroyed by evaporation or
ablation, or give rise to star formation. If the final fate of the clouds is
stars, the IMF of the stars formed over the whole cooling flow region ($r \sim
100$ kpc) should be biased to low masses, to avoid a very luminous, blue halo
for the central galaxy of the cooling flow. However, there is evidence for
bright star formation in the innermost (r < 10 kpc) regions of some cooling
flows, and, therefore, the biasing of the IMF towards low masses should not
occur or be less important at smaller radii. The consideration of magnetic
fields may shed light on these two points. If magnetic fields are present, the
magnetic critical mass should be considered, besides the Jeans mass, in
establishing a natural mass scale for star formation. When this new mass scale
is taken into account, we obtain the right variation of the biasing of the IMF
with the radius in addition to inhibition of high-mass star formation at large
radii. We also demonstrate that magnetic reconnection is a efficient than
ambipolar diffusion in removing magnetic fields in cold clouds.

The purpose of this note is to investigate what could be the `right bound'.
  In this paper we use the result of Deuring on the supersingular primes for a
CM elliptic curves to give estimate on the number of torsion points on CM
elliptic curves over any number field which depends only linearly with the
degree of the number field. This result is also a simple corollary of a result
of A. Silverberg bounding the order of torsion elements which was proved using
the main theorem of Complex multiplication. We also give a heuristic for hoping
that the number of torsion points on any elliptic curve be a bounded linearly
with the degree of the number field.

different cases: (i) propagation of electromagnetic wave in the presence of a
constant external magnetic field; (ii) propagation of electromagnetic wave in
the presence of a linearly decreasing magnetic field which corresponds to a
realistic ECR discharge. The simulation results indicate that at the resonance
layer, the electrons are heated by the electromagnetic wave, and the incoming
wave amplitude is pronouncedly damped, with the wave hardly propagating through
the ECR layer.

that the computational effort grows with approximately the eighth power of the

exponentially. The scaling behaviour of a derived lattice model is also

corresponding sequential one (local measurements, accompanying by transfer of
classical information). The case of equality is achieved only when the mixed

a case then the two systems are entangled: measurement of one system induces a

quantum mechanics must be non-local. Bell's theorem consists of two parts:
first a correlation inequality is derived that must be satisfied by all local
realistic theories; second it is demonstrated that quantum mechanical
probabilities violate this inequality in certain cases. In the case of ideal
experiments, Bell's theorem has been proven. However, in the case of real
experiments where polarizers and detectors are non-ideal, the theorem has not
yet been proven since the proof always requires some arbitrary and {\em ad hoc}
supplementary assumptions. In this paper, we state a new and rather weak
supplementary assumption for the ensemble of photons that emerge from the
polarizers, and we show that the conjunction of Einstein's locality with this
assumption leads to validity of an inequality that is violated by a factor as
large as 1.5 in the case of real experiments. Moreover, the present
supplementary assumption is considerably weaker and more general than Clauser,
Horne, Shimony, Holt supplementary assumption.
