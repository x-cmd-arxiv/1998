  (Note: displayed abstract is abridged)",,"10.1086/311746",,"astro-ph",,"  More than a dozen microlensing events have been detected so far towards the
LMC and 2 towards the SMC. If all the lenses are in the Galactic halo, both the
LMC and the SMC events are expected to have similar time scales. However, the
first event towards the SMC, MACHO 97-SMC-1, had a time scale of 123 days which
is much larger than the typical time scale for the LMC events. From optical
depth estimates, we first show that the stars within the SMC play a dominant
role as gravitational lenses and can fully account for the observed
microlensing events, mainly due to its large physical depth. We also show that
if the lenses are within the Magellanic Clouds, then the SMC events should be
longer in duration than the LMC events, a fact that is consistent with the
observations. The time scale of the event implies that the mass of the lens is
>2 solar masses if it is in the Milky Way disk or halo, in which case the lens
is expected to be bright and should reveal itself in the spectrum. Here, we
present an optical spectrum of MACHO 97-SMC-1 which shows that the lens is not
in the Milky Way disk or halo, but is a low-mass star within the SMC. It is
worth noting here that MACHO SMC-98-1 is the only OTHER observed event towards
the SMC. This was a binary lens event where the caustic crossing time-scale as
observed by PLANET, MACHO, EROS and OGLE collaborations, suggests that the lens
is within the SMC. Furthermore, the only LMC event where the location of the
lens is known is the binary lens event MACHO LMC-9, for which the lens is also
within the LMC. Thus, ALL the 3 microlensing events towards the Magellanic
Clouds for which we have independent knowledge of the location of the lenses
are due to self-lensing within the Magellanic Clouds.

significantly improved our understanding of cluster evolution by showing that
the bulk of the population of galaxy clusters is not evolving significantly
since at least z~=0.8, with some evolution limited to only the most luminous,
presumably most massive systems. Thus far, a well defined sample of very high

the neutrino luminosities and spectra and of the angular distributions of the

theory, we analyze two related methods for imposing this constraint: the
iterative purification strategy of McWeeny, as modified by Palser and

analysis indicates that the two methods have complementary strengths and
weaknesses, and leads us to propose that a hybrid of the two methods should be
more effective than either method by itself. This idea is tested by using
tight-binding theory to apply the proposed hybrid method to a set of condensed

the present series of papers. This kernel describes a point process -- a
probability measure on a space of countable point configurations. The kernel is
expressed in terms of the Whittaker confluent hypergeometric functions. It
depends on two parameters and determines a $J$-symmetric operator $K$ in
$L^2(R_+)\oplus L^2(R_+)$.
  It turns out that the operator $K$ can be represented in the form
$L(1+L)^{-1}$, where $L$ is a rather simple integral operator: the kernel of
$L$ is expressed in terms of elementary functions only. This is our main
result; it elucidates the nature of the matrix Whittaker kernel and makes it
possible to directly verify the existence of the associated point process.
  Next, we show that the matrix Whittaker kernel can be degenerated to a family
of kernels expressed through the Bessel and Macdonald functions. In this way
one can obtain both the well-known Bessel kernel (which arises in random matrix
theory) and certain interesting new kernels.

Several such libraries are described, as are implementation technologies.

  '98"" Gatliburg, USA, August 1998",,"10.1063/1.59539",,"nucl-th",,"  We present a review of recent applications of the relativistic mean-field
theory to the structure of nuclei close to the drip-lines. For systems with
extreme isospin values, the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model provides a
unified and self-consistent description of mean-field and pairing correlations.
The model has been applied in studies of structure phenomena that include:
formation of neutron skin and of neutron halos in light nuclei in the mass
region above the s-d neutron shell, the strong isospin dependence of the
effective spin-orbit interaction and the resulting modification of surface
properties, the suppression of the spherical N=28 shell gap for neutron-rich
nuclei and the related phenomenon of deformation and shape coexistence, the
proton drip-line in the spherical nuclei $14\leq Z \leq 28$, and ground-state
proton radioactivity in the region of deformed nuclei $59 \leq Z \leq 69$.

divergence in two and three dimensions with special emphasis on the
nucleon-nucleon interaction. Both types of renormalizations are performed for
attractive divergent one- and two-term separable potentials, a divergent tensor
potential, and the sum of a delta function and its derivatives. We allow
energy-dependent couplings, and determine the form that these couplings should
take if equivalence between the two regularization schemes is to be enforced.
We also perform renormalization of an attractive separable potential superposed
on an analytic divergent potential.

less than some threshold value determined by the spontaneous curvature, a

dominant deformation modes are also determined by dynamical instability
analysis, and the different effects of Zn$^{2+}$ and Mg$^{2+}$ ions on DNA

bound is achieved for the maximally mixed state, a further hint for the quantum
