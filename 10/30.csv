at 7 and 15 micron with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) satellite. These
observations reveal a large number of luminous Mid-Infrared (MIR) sources.
Cross-identification in the optical and Near-Infrared (NIR) wavebands shows
that about half of the 7 micron sources are cluster galaxies. The other 7
micron and almost all 15 micron sources are identified as lensed distant
galaxies. Thanks to the gravitational amplification they constitute the
faintest MIR detected sources, allowing us to extend the number counts in both
the 7 and 15 micron bands. In particular, we find that the 15 micron counts
have a steep slope alpha_15 = -1.5 +/- 0.3 and are large, with N_15 (>30
microJy}) = 13 +/- 5 per square arcmin. These numbers rule out non-evolutionary
models and favour very strong evolution. Down to our counts limit, we found
that the resolved 7 and 15 microns background radiation intensity is
respectively (2 +/-0.5) 10^(-9) and (5 +/-1) 10^(-9) W m^(-2) sr^(-1).

4 decades of usable temporal frequency. The PDS shows no signs of any strict or
quasi-periodicity, but does show a progressive flattening of the power-law
slope from -1.74 at short time scales to -0.73 at longer time scales. This is
the clearest observation to date of the long-predicted cutoff in the PDS. The
characteristic variability time scale corresponding to this cutoff temporal
frequency is 1 month. Although it is unclear how this time scale may be
interpreted in terms of a physical size or process, there are several promising
candidate models. The PDS appears similar to those seen for Galactic black hole
candidates such as Cyg X-1, suggesting that these two classes of objects with
very different luminosities and putative black hole masses (differing by more

differences between these BL Lacs and QSOs in the Pearson-Readhead sample. The
BL Lacs are found to be more highly variable in total flux density than the

amplitude at 14.5 and 4.8 GHz in contrast to the behavior in the QSOs and
supporting the existence of class-dependent differences in opacity within the
parsec-scale jet flows. Structure function analyses of the flux observations
quantify that a characteristic timescale is identifiable in only 1/3 of the BL
Lacs. The time-averaged fractional linear polarizations are only on the order
of a few percent and are consistent with the presence of tangled magnetic
fields within the emitting regions. In many sources a preferred long-term
orientation of the EVPA is present; when compared with the VLBI structural
axis, no preferred position angle difference is identified. The polarized flux
typically exhibits variability with timescales of months to a few years and
shows the signature of a propagating shock during several resolved outbursts.
The observations indicate that the source emission is predominately due to
evolving source components and support the occurrence of more frequent shock
formation in BL Lac parsec-scale flows than in QSO jets. The differences in
variability behavior and polarization between BL Lacs and QSOs can be explained
by differences in jet stability.

equilibrium after each merging event. Before merging it is gravitationally
heated at the local virial temperature when bound in subclusters; at early $z$
the gas is preheated by supernova activity following star formation. In detail,
we compute analytically the following steps: the dynamic histories of dark
matter halos with their merging events; the associated infall of gas into a
halo, with compressions and shocks estabilishing the conditions at the cluster
boundary; the updated disposition of the gas in the potential well matching
such conditions; the statistical convolution of the key quantities over the

profiles with no free parameters; the so-called $\beta$ parameter is itself an
outcome of the model, and the polytropic index $\gamma$ is internally
constrained to a narrow range. We obtain declining temperature profiles, and
profiles for the density and for the surface brightness shallower in groups
compared with clusters. Our model groups also contain a lower baryonic fraction
on average, but with a scatter considerably larger than at cluster scales.
Various statistics are obtained analytically upon averaging over the merging
histories. In particular, we predict in different cosmologies the statistical

The cluster FP is different from the FP of elliptical galaxies, and from the
virial prediction. Some implications of the cluster FP are discussed. Finally,
we describe the phase-space distributions of different populations of cluster
galaxies. Different galaxy classes are defined according to their morphological

galaxies have a velocity dispersion profile that (in combination with their
wider spatial distribution) is suggestive of first infall into the cluster. On
the contrary, quiescent (early-type) galaxies show evidence of a dynamically
relaxed distribution.

one-loop self-energy correction of the spin and charge fluctuations, we have
numerically calculated the self-energy, the spectral function, and the density
of states in the weak-coupling regime at finite temperature. Pseudogap
formations have been observed in both the density of states and the spectral
function at the Fermi level. The pseudogap in the spectral function is
explained by the non-Fermi-liquid-like nature of the self-energy. The anomalous
behavior in the self-energy is caused by both the strong antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuation and the nesting condition on the non-interacting Fermi surface. In
the present approximation, we find a logarithmic singularity in the integrand
of the imaginary part of the self-energy. Concerning the energy dependence of
the spectral function and the self-energy, two theorems are proved. They give a
necessary condition in the self-energy to produce the pseudogap at the Fermi
level. The pseudogap in the spectral function is highly momentum dependent on
the Fermi surface. It opens initially in the $(\pm \pi,0)$, $(0,\pm \pi)$
regions as the normal state pseudogap observed in the high-$T_c$
superconductors and if the interaction is increased, it spreads to other Fermi
surface sectors. The anisotropy of the pseudogap is produced by the low-energy
enhancement of the spin excitation around ${\bf Q}=(\pi,\pi)$ and the flatness
of the band dispersion around the saddle point.

  The closure is equivalent to assuming that the equal-time two-point
correlation function out of equilibrium has the same properties as its
equilibrium version.
  The changes in time of the density depend on the functional derivatives of
the grand canonical free energy functional $F[\rho]$ of the system. In
particular the static solutions of the equation for the density correspond to
the exact equilibrium profiles provided one is able to determine the exact form
of $F[\rho]$. In order to assess the validity of our approach we performed a
comparison between the Langevin dynamics and the dynamic density functional
method for a one-dimensional hard-rod system in three relevant cases and found
remarkable agreement, with some interesting exceptions, which are discussed and
explained. In addition, we consider the case where one is forced to use an

case the domain size evolves with time as $L(t)\sim t^{1/d_w}$, where $d_w$ is
the anomalous random walk exponent associated with the fractal and differs from
the normal value 2, which characterizes all Euclidean lattices. Such a power
law growth is identical to the one observed in the study of the spherical model
on the same lattice, but fails to describe the asymptotic behavior of the
numerical solutions of the TDGL equation for a scalar order parameter. In fact,
the simulations performed on a two dimensional Sierpinski Carpet indicate that,
after an initial stage dominated by a curvature reduction mechanism \`a la
Allen-Cahn, the system enters in a regime where the domain walls between
competing phases are pinned by lattice defects.
  The lack of translational invariance determines a rough free energy
landscape, the existence of many metastable minima and the suppression of the
marginally stable modes, which in translationally invariant systems lead to
power law growth and self similar patterns. On fractal structures as the
temperature vanishes the evolution is frozen, since only thermally activated
processes can sustain the growth of pinned domains.

due to its relation to the so called {\it Proton Spin Problem}. The relevant
flavor singlet axial current is anomalous, i.e., its divergence contains a
piece which is the celebrated $U_A(1)$ anomaly. This anomaly is intimately
associated with the $\eta^\prime$ meson, which gets its mass from it. When the
gauge degrees of freedom of QCD are confined within a volume as is presently
understood, the $U_A(1)$ anomaly is known to induce color anomaly leading to
""leakage"" of the color out of the confined volume (or bag). For consistency of
the theory, this anomaly should be canceled by a boundary term. This ``color
boundary term"" inherits part or most of the dynamics of the volume (i.e., QCD).
In this paper, we exploit this mapping of the volume to the surafce via the
color boundary condition to perform a complete analysis of the flavor singlet
axial charge in the chiral bag model using the Cheshire Cat Principle. This
enables us to obtain the hitherto missing piece in the axial charge associated
with the gluon Casimir energies. The result is that the flavor singlet axial
charge is small independent of the confinement (bag) size ranging from the
skyrmion picture to the MIT bag picture, thereby confirming the (albeit
approximate) Cheshire Cat phenomenon.

Conceptual difficulties of the traditional approach to particle oscillation are
discussed. It is shown how the probability current density and the wave packet
treatments of particle oscillations resolve some problems. It is also shown
that only full field theoretical approach is free from conceptual difficulties.
The possibility of oscillation of particles produced together with kaons or
neutrinos is considered in full wave packet quantum mechanics language. Precise
definition of the oscillation of particles which recoil against mixed states is
given. The general amplitude which describes the oscillation of two particles
in the final states is found. Using this EPR-type amplitude the problem of
oscillation of particles recoiling against kaons or neutrinos is resolved. The
relativistic EPR correlations on distances of the order of coherence lengths
are considered.

first order approximation the constants characterizing the power spectrum
density (PSD) are renormalized but it retains its typical shape. This is due to
the fact that the involved Feynman diagrams are of tadpole type. Higher order
approximations are required to give rise to up-conversion effects. This result
is predicted by the perturbative approach and is in agreement with the
numerical results obtained by studying the system's non-linear response by
numerically simulating its dynamics.

two perfectly conducting moving walls. By means of a conformal transformation
we derive a set of generalized Moore's equations whose solution contains the
whole information of the radiation field within the cavity. For the case of
resonant oscillations we solve these equations using a renormalization group
procedure that appropriately deals with the secular behaviour present in a
naive perturbative approach. We study the time evolution of the energy density
profile and of the number of created photons inside the cavity.

quantum systems (qubits). The optimal partially entangled state with a high
degree of symmetry is considered to be useful for overcoming a shot noise limit
of Ramsey spectroscopy under some decoherence. This state is invariant under
permutation of any two qubits and inversion between the ground state $|0\ket$
and an excited state $|1\ket$ for each qubit. We show that using selective
phase shifts in certain basis vectors and Grover's inversion about average
operations, we can construct this high symmetric entangled state by
$({polynomial in $n$})\times 2^{n/2}$ successive unitary transformations that
are applied on two or three qubits. We can apply our method to build more
general entangled states.
