that the electron distribution is rapidly changing, often on time scales
shorter than the light crossing time. The emitting region is sufficiently
compact to let radiative losses dominate the cooling of high energy electrons.
We study the time dependent behaviour of the electron distribution after
episodic electron injection phases, and calculate the observed synchrotron and
self Compton radiation spectra. Since photons produced in different part of the
source have different travel times, the observed spectrum is produced by the
electron distribution at different stages of evolution. Even a homogeneous
source then resembles an inhomogeneous one. Time delays between the light
curves of fluxes at different frequencies are possible, as illustrated for the
specific case of the BL Lac object Mkn 421.

19,000 sec. over 7 orbits, with the 0.063-arcsec-wide slit along the line
between the two brightness peaks (PA 42). A spectrum of Jupiter is used as a
spectral template. The rotation curve is resolved, and reaches a maximum
amplitude of ~250 km/s roughly 0.3 arcsec either side of a rotation center
lying between P1 and P2, 0.16 +/- 0.05 arcsec from the optically fainter P2. We
find the velocity dispersion to be < 250 km/s everywhere except for a narrow
``dispersion spike'', centered 0.06 +/- 0.03 arcsec on the anti-P1 side of P2,
in which sigma peaks at 440 +/- 70 km/s. At much lower confidence, we see local
disturbances to the rotation curve at P1 and P2, and an elevation in sigma at
P1. At very low significance we detect a weak asymmetry in the line-of-sight
velocity distribution opposite to the sense usually encountered. Convolving our
V and sigma profiles to CFHT resolution, we find good agreement with the
results of Kormendy & Bender (1998, preprint), though there is a 20%
discrepancy in the dispersion that cannot be attributed to the dispersion
spike. Our results are not consistent with the location of the maximum
dispersion as found by Bacon et al. We find that the sinking star cluster model
of Emsellem & Combes (1997) does not reproduce either the rotation curve or the
dispersion profile. The eccentric disk model of Tremaine (1995) fares better,
and can be improved somewhat by adjusting the original parameters. However,
detailed modeling will require dynamical models of significantly greater
realism.

width for an elastic magnetic peak show that it saturates at a finite value
below 30 K, corresponding to a spin-spin correlation length of 200 A. A model
calculation indicates that the differing widths of magnetic and (previously
reported) charge-order peaks, together with the lack of commensurability, can
be consistently explained by disorder in the stripe spacing. Above 30 K, the
width of the nominally elastic signal begins to increase. Interpreting the
signal as critical scattering from slowly fluctuating spins, the temperature
dependence of the width is consistent with renormalized classical behavior of a
2-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Inelastic scattering
measurements show that incommensurate spin excitations survive at and above 50

problem amounts to finding the second order Zerilli wave equation, and in
particular the effective source term due to the linear quadrapole. With one
minor exception, our calculations confirm the earlier findings of Gleiser,
et.al. On route to these results we also illustrate that, with the aid of
computer algebra, the linear Schwarzschild problem can be solved in a very
direct manner (i.e., without resorting to the usual function transformations),
and it is this ``direct method'' that drives the higher order perturbation
analysis. The calculations were performed using the GRTensorII computer algebra
package, running on the Maple V platform, along with several new Maple routines
that we have written specifically for these types of problems. Although we have
chosen to consider only the ``quadrapole-quadrapole'' calculation in this

would allow this analysis to be repeated for a far more general problem. These
