  for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (Vol 513, March 1, 1999)",,"10.1086/306829",,"astro-ph",,"  Supernova remnants (SNRs) are widely believed to be the principal source of
galactic cosmic rays. Such energetic particles can produce gamma-rays and lower
energy photons via interactions with the ambient plasma. In this paper, we
present results from a Monte Carlo simulation of non-linear shock structure and
acceleration coupled with photon emission in shell-like SNRs. These
non-linearities are a by-product of the dynamical influence of the accelerated
cosmic rays on the shocked plasma and result in distributions of cosmic rays
which deviate from pure power-laws. Such deviations are crucial to acceleration
efficiency and spectral considerations, producing GeV/TeV intensity ratios that
are quite different from test particle predictions. The Sedov scaling solution
for SNR expansions is used to estimate important shock parameters for input
into the Monte Carlo simulation. We calculate ion and electron distributions
that spawn neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton, and synchrotron
emission, yielding complete photon spectra from radio frequencies to gamma-ray
energies. The cessation of acceleration caused by the spatial and temporal
limitations of the expanding SNR shell in moderately dense interstellar regions
can yield spectral cutoffs in the TeV energy range; these are consistent with
Whipple's TeV upper limits on unidentified EGRET sources. Supernova remnants in
lower density environments generate higher energy cosmic rays that produce
predominantly inverse Compton emission at super-TeV energies; such sources will
generally be gamma-ray dim at GeV energies.

optical jet or tidal tail extending towards what appears to be a companion
galaxy 28 kpc away via a low surface brightness envelope. The molecular gas
appears to be distributed in an asymmetric disk rotating around an unresolved
continuum source, which is presumably emission from the AGN. A narrow (approx
60 km/s) absorption feature is also observed in the CO spectrum and is
coincident with the continuum source. Using the standard CO conversion factor,
the molecular gas mass is calculated to be 1.5x10^10 M_sun, several times the
molecular gas mass of the Milky Way. The high concentration of molecular gas
within the central 3 kpc of 3C 293, combined with the multiwavelength

triggered by a gas-rich galaxy-galaxy interaction or merger event.

  held in Taormina, Italy, September 1998",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The complete absence of radio pulsars with periods exceeding a few seconds
has lead to the popular notion of the existence of a high period death line. We
have recently postulated the existence of another radio quiescence boundary at
high magnetic fields ($B\gtrsim 4\times 10^{13}$G) in the upper portion of the
period-period derivative diagram, a domain where no radio pulsars are observed.
The origin of this high B boundary is also due to the suppression of magnetic
pair creation, $\gamma\to e^{\pm}$, but mainly because of competition with the
exotic QED process of magnetic photon splitting, $\gamma\to\gamma\gamma$,
coupled with ground state pair creation. This mechanism could also explain the
low spectral cutoff energy of the gamma-ray pulsar PSR1509-58, which lies near
the high B death-line. In this paper, we summarize the hypothesis of this new
``death line,'' and discuss some subtleties of pair suppression that relate to
photon polarization and positronium formation. We identify several ways in
which Integral will serve as a useful tool in probing high field pulsars, given
that the radio quiescence boundary is transparent to the high energy bands.

$\sim 60 h^{-1}$ Mpc in the Lynx-Ursa Major region ($\alpha \sim 9^{\rm h} -

the KUGs in the LUM filament and used these to investigate the integrated
colors, distribution of SF regions, morphologies, and local environments. We
found that these KUGs consist of distorted spiral galaxies and compact galaxies
with blue colors. Their star formation occurs in the entire disk, and is not
confined to just the central regions. The colors of the SF regions imply that
active star formation in the spiral galaxies occurred $10^{7 - 8}$ yr ago,
while that of the compact objects occurred $10^{6-7}$ yr ago. Though the
photometric characteristics of these KUGs are similar to those of interacting
galaxies or mergers, most of these KUGs do not show direct evidence of merger
processes.

The contribution to absorption from LSB galaxies is large for any galaxy
surface brightness distribution which is currently supported by observations.
Ly\alpha absorbers should become powerful tools for studying the properties and
evolution of galaxies, but first it will be necessary to establish
observationally the nature of the Ly\alpha absorbers at low redshift. Further
simulations, in which the absorbing galaxy population is 'observed' with some
selection criteria, are used to explore how easily possible it is for an
observer to test for a scenario in which LSB galaxies give rise to most of the

element in the theory of galaxy formation. Towards this end, we have
reconsidered the outcome of the nonlinear growth of a uniform, spherical
density perturbation in an unperturbed background universe - the cosmological
``top-hat'' problem. We adopt the usual assumption that the collapse to
infinite density at a finite time predicted by the top-hat solution is
interrupted by a rapid virialization caused by the growth of small-scale
inhomogeneities in the initial perturbation. We replace the standard
description of the postcollapse object as a uniform sphere in virial
equilibrium by a more self-consistent one as a truncated, nonsingular,
isothermal sphere in virial and hydrostatic equilibrium, including for the
first time a proper treatment of the finite-pressure boundary condition on the
sphere. The results differ significantly from both the uniform sphere and the
singular isothermal sphere approximations for the postcollapse objects. These
results will have a significant effect on a wide range of applications of the
Press-Schechter and other semi-analytical models to cosmology. The truncated
isothermal sphere solution presented here predicts the virial temperature and
integrated mass distribution of the X-ray clusters formed in the CDM model as
found by detailed, 3D, numerical gas and N-body dynamical simulations

their paper actually demand that no trapped surface is formed $ 2GM_b/ R_b c^2
\le 1$, and $M_b \equiv 0$! Anybody may verify it. Further, by analyzing the
general inhomogeneous dust solutions of Tolman in a proper physical
perspective, we show that, all dust solutions are characterized by $M_b=0$.
Next, for a collapsing fluid endowed with radiation pressure, we discover that
the collapse equations obey the same Global Constraint $2GM /R c^2 \le 1$ and
which specifically shows that, contrary to the traditional intuitive Newtonian
idea, which equates the gravitational mass ($M_b$) with the fixed baryonic mass
($M_0$), the trapped surfaces are not allowed in general theory of relativity
(GTR). For continued collapse, the final gravitational mss $M_f \to 0$ as $R\to
0$. Thus we confirm Einstein's and Rosen's idea that Event Horizons and
Schwarzschild Singularities are unphysical and can not occur in Nature. This,
in turn, implies that, if there would be any continued collapse, the initial
gravitational mass energy of the fluid must be radiated away $Q\to M_i c^2$.
This also implies that, gravitational collapse of massive stars should give
rise to Ultra Compact Objects and emission of energy much more than what is

i.e. the equality of the soliton mass to the central charge, remains intact at
the quantum level in all orders of the weak coupling expansion. Our key finding
is an anomaly in the expression for the central charge. The classical central
charge, equal to the jump of the superpotential, is amended by an anomalous
term proportional to the second derivative of the superpotential. The anomaly
is established by various methods in explicit one-loop calculations. We argue
that this one-loop result is not affected by higher orders. We discuss in
detail how the impact of the boundary conditions can be untangled from the
soliton mass calculation. In particular, the soliton profile and the energy
distribution are found at one loop. A ""supersymmetry"" in the soliton mass
calculations in the non-supersymmetric models is observed.
