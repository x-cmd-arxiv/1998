are: (1) The RLQ sample has significantly stronger [O III]5007 emission than
the RQQ sample. (2) The RLQ sample has significantly narrower (in FWHM) Hbeta
broad component line profiles than the RQQ sample. (3) At the sensitivity of

have broad-absorption-line clouds with a small (~10-20%) covering factor and
that differences between the two types are merely a function of viewing angle

various optical wavelengths and in the Near-Infrared K'-band. HI rotation
curves were obtained for all gas rich systems. The Near-Infrared surface
brightness distribution of disk galaxies turns out to be bimodal; galaxies
avoid a domain around a face-on disk central surface brightness of 18.5
mag/arcsec^2. This bimodality is particularly striking when only the more
isolated, non-interacting systems are considered. The Luminosity Function of
the HSB family of galaxies is truncated well above the completion limit while
the Luminosity Function of the LSB family is still sharply rising at our
limiting magnitude. Near-Infrared mass-to-light ratios suggest that HSB
galaxies are close to a kinematic maximum-disk situation while LSB galaxies are
dark matter dominated at all radii. Assuming equal Near-Infrared mass-to-light
ratios for both HSB and LSB systems, we find that the gap in the surface
brightness distribution corresponds to a situation in which the baryonic mass
is marginally self-gravitating. We finally conclude that the luminosity-line
width relation is a fundamental correlation between the amount and distribution
of dark matter mass and the total luminosity, regardless of how the luminous
mass is distributed within the dark mater halo.

the existence of an emission feature within the Damped Lyman Alpha (DLA)
absorption trough. By observing also at slit positions offset from the quasar,
we show that the emission is spatially extended by at least a few arcseconds,
and hence confirm that the feature seen must be due to emission rather than
unusual absorption characteristics. We find that the DLA trough is very close
in redshift to the broad Lyman~$\alpha$ emission line of the QSO, with the
result that the DLA absorption removes much of the peak region of that line.
Despite the similarity of the redshifts of the DLA and the QSO, the lack of
high-ionization lines of the DLA system and the unresolved widths of the
corresponding metal lines indicate that the DLA cloud is not an associated
system. The emission feature has a large velocity offset of +490 km/s with
respect to the DLA system, and is resolved in velocity, comprising two
components with a separation of ~ 300 km/s. We consider three possibilities:
(1) Both emission and absorption occur within an object similar to the high
redshift Lyman-break galaxies; (2) The emission feature arises from an object
distinct from both the DLA absorber and the QSO, perhaps a young star-forming
galaxy or a proto-galactic clump. It could be associated with the DLA absorber
and perhaps the QSO in a compact group or cluster; (3) The redshifts are such
that the emission feature could be due to Narrow Line Region filaments of the
QSO, if the DLA absorption covers a sufficiently small angular size to allow
the filaments to be seen beyond the edge of the DLA cloud.

not only in cluster ellipticals but also in field ellipticals and bulges formed
at high redshifts ($z\gsim 3$). Since such stars account for at least $\sim
30%$ of the baryons now locked into stars, it is argued that at least 30% of
stars and metals formed before $z\simeq 3$, and correspondingly the metallicity
of the universe at $z=3$ is predicted to be $\sim 1/10$ solar. This requires
the cosmic star formation rate to run at least flat from $z\sim 1$ to $\sim 5$,
which appears to agree with the most recent derect determinations of the star
formation rate in Lyman-break galaxies.

available published photometry and kinematics as well as of two-dimensional
TIGER spectrography. We first examined the kinematics in the central 40 arcsec
in the light of two integral f(E,J) models. Jeans equations were used to
constrain the mass to light ratio, and the central dark mass whose existence
was suggested by previous studies. The even part of the distribution function
was then retrieved via the Hunter & Qian formalism. We thus confirmed that the
velocity and dispersion profiles in the central region could be well fit with a
two-integral model, given the presence of a central dark mass of ~10^9 Msun.
However, no two integral model could fit the h_3 profile around a radius of 25
arcsec where the outer disc dominates the surface brightness distribution.
Three integral analytical models were therefore built using a Quadratic
Programming technique. These models showed that three integral components do
indeed provide a reasonable fit to the kinematics, including the higher
Gauss-Hermite moments. Again, models without a central dark mass failed to
reproduce the observed kinematics in the central arcseconds. This clearly
supports the presence of a nuclear black hole of at least 6.5 10^8 Msun in the
centre of NGC 3115. These models were finally used to estimate the importance
of the dark matter in the outer part of NGC 3115, suggested by the flat stellar

interstellar medium in order to distinguish variations in the soft X-ray
background (SXRB) intensity caused by photoelectric absorption effects from
those due to excess X-ray emission. The X-ray data are modelled as a
combination of emission from the Local Hot Bubble (LHB) and emission from a
distant plasma in the galactic halo and extragalactic sources. The X-ray
radiation intensity of the galactic halo and extragalactic X-ray background is
modulated by the photoelectric absorption of the intervening galactic
interstellar matter. We show that large- and small-scale intensity variations
of the 1/4 keV SXRB are caused by photoelectric absorption which is
predominantly traced by the total N(HI) distribution. The extensive coverage of
the two surveys supports evidence for a hot, X-ray emitting corona. We show
that this leads to a good representation of the SXRB observations. For four
large areas on the sky, we search for regions where the modelled and observed
X-ray emission differ. We find that there is excess X-ray emission towards

of sight towards HVCs also pass through significant amounts of
intermediate-velocity gas, so we cannot constrain the possible role played by
IVC gas in these directions of HVC and IVC overlap, in determining the X-ray

  appear in IOP proc. series. LaTeX error fixed",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In the past 40 years a considerable effort has been focused in determining
the age of the Universe at zero redshift using several stellar clocks. In this
review I will describe the best theoretical methods to determine the age of the
oldest Galactic Globular Clusters (GC). I will also argue that a more accurate
age determination may come from passively evolving high-redshift ellipticals.
In particular, I will review two new methods to determine the age of GC. These
two methods are more accurate than the classical isochrone fitting technique.
The first method is based on the morphology of the horizontal branch and is
independent of the distance modulus of the globular cluster. The second method
uses a careful binning of the stellar luminosity function which determines
simultaneously the distance and age of the GC. It is found that the oldest GCs
have an age of $13.5 \pm 2$ Gyr. The absolute minimum age for the oldest GCs is
10.5 Gyr and the maximum is 16.0 Gyr (with 99% confidence). Therefore, an
Einstein-De Sitter Universe ($\Omega=1$) is not totally ruled out if the Hubble
constant is about $65 \pm 10$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. On the other hand, the
newly discovered red elliptical 53W069 ($z=1.43$) provides an stronger
constraint since its minimun age is 3.2 Gyr, thus ruling out an Einstein-De
Sitter Universe unless the Hubble constant is $\leq 45 \pm 10$ km s$^{-1}$.
Using 53W069 we find an age at $z=0$ of $13 \pm 2$ Gyr, in excellent agreement
with the GC determination.

approximation by a power law with photon index Gamma ~ 2. This is flatter than
for most X-ray-selected BL Lacs observed with ASCA, in agreement with the
predictions of current blazar unification models. While 1749+096 exhibits
tentative evidence for spectral flattening at low energies, a concave continuum
is detected for 2200+420: the steep low-energy component is consistent the
high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission responsible for the longer
wavelengths, while the harder tail at higher energies is the onset of the
Compton component. The spectral energy distributions from radio to gamma-rays
are consistent with synchrotron-self Compton emission from a single homogeneous
region shortward of the IR/optical wavelengths, with a second component in the
radio domain related to a more extended emission region. For 2200+420,
comparing the 1995 Nov state with the optical/GeV flare of 1997 July, we find
that models requiring inverse Compton scattering of external photons provide a
viable mechanism for the production of the highest (GeV) energies during the
flare. An increase of the external radiation density and of the power injected
in the jet can reproduce the flat gamma-ray continuum observed in 1997 July. A
directly testable prediction of this model is that the line luminosity in

  Review D 1991, revised 1997",,,"CNR-IEI B4-19 1998","hep-ph",,"  A simple and general law of mass, intrinsically with zero freely-adaptable
parameters, is shown to be valid for all the hadrons with one or more flavored
(s, c, or b) quarks/antiquarks, both baryons and mesons. It establishes
correspondences H-->{P_i} between these hadrons with at least one flavored
constituent, H, and specific sets of lighter particles, {P_i}, in which the
total baryon and lepton numbers are conserved. The law is polynomial with a
varying degree that univocally depends only on the particles involved. Its
statement may be given straightforwardly in terms of the binomial series
converging to 1/sqrt{1-beta}. It asserts that, for each hadron H, there exists
a certain set of lighter particles {P_i}, together with a specific reference
hadron h_0 that fixes the mass scale, such that, for a value of the sum of this
power series equal to the mass of H, a definite partial sum of the series
equals the total mass of particles {P_i}. The starting, independent data in the
rule are the masses of the hadrons with exclusively unflavored (u and d)
constituents (among which, our hadrons h_0, such as the proton or pion) and the
masses of leptons. The consequence of the law is a pre-discretization of the
mass spectrum of the hadrons containing at least one flavored constituent, on
account of which the mass of any of them may only assume one of the values
aprioristically determined by the total masses of lighter particles.

Scherk-Schwarz mechanism which leads to scalar sparticle masses that are only
logarithmically sensitive to the cutoff starting at two loops. As a result,
squarks and sleptons are naturally an order of magnitude lighter than gauginos.
In addition, the mechanism is very predictive and the sparticle spectrum
depends on just two new parameters. A significant advantage of this mechanism
relative to gauge mediation is that a Higgsino mass $\mu\sim M_susy$ is
automatically generated when supersymmetry is broken. Our analysis applies
equally well to theories where the cutoff is near a TeV or $M_{Pl}$ or some

only. The complex structure requires an even number of timelike directions. The
transposed structure is always defined. A further structure which can be
referred as ""spacetime-splitting"" is based on a fractal property of the

regime a linear stability analysis of the hexagons reveals long- and short-wave
instabilities, which can be steady or oscillatory. The oscillatory short-wave
instabilities can lead to stable hexagon patterns that are periodically
modulated in space and time, or to a state of spatio-temporal chaos with a
Fourier spectrum that precesses on average in time. The chaotic state can
exhibit bistability with the steady hexagon pattern. There exist regimes in
which the steady hexagon patterns are unstable at all wavenumbers.

light by electrons was a linear process (i.e., the scattered light frequency
was identical to that of the incident light) and that light's magnetic field
played no role. Today, with the recent invention of ultra-high-peak-power
lasers it is now possible to create a sufficient photon density to study
Thomson scattering in the relativistic regime. With increasing light intensity,
electrons quiver during the scattering process with increasing velocity,
approaching the speed of light when the laser intensity approaches 10^18
W/cm^2. In this limit, the effect of light's magnetic field on electron motion
should become comparable to that of its electric field, and the electron mass
should increase because of the relativistic correction. Consequently, electrons
in such high fields are predicted to quiver nonlinearly, moving in figure-eight
patterns, rather than in straight lines, and thus to radiate photons at
harmonics of the frequency of the incident laser light, with each harmonic
having its own unique angular distribution. In this letter, we report the first
ever direct experimental confirmation of these predictions, a topic that has
previously been referred to as nonlinear Thomson scattering. Extension of these
results to coherent relativistic harmonic generation may eventually lead to
novel table-top x-ray sources.
