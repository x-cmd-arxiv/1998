In the case of small partition coefficient the full problem is reduced to the
system of two ordinary differential equations describing the interface motion
in terms of its velocity and position coordinate. The type of the oscillatory
instability bifurcation is studied in detail in different limits. For the
subcrytical bifurcaton relaxation interface oscillations are analyzed
analytically and numerically. We show that these oscillation exibit a number of
anomalous properies. In particular, such oscillations can be weakly- or
strongly-dissipative depending on the physical parameters and the amplitude of
the strongly-dissipative oscillations is determined not only by the form of the
corresponding nullcline but also by the behavior of the system for small values
of the interface velocity. Characteristic parameters of the superlattice
occuring in the growing crystal are estimated.

galaxies of increasing current star formation activity emit a larger proportion
of their bolometric luminosity via dust absorption and re-radiation in the
thermal mid- to far-infrared. Several new observations indicate that this trend
continues back to earlier cosmic times, when star formation rates were very
high, and a large fraction of the resulting UV power was reprocessed by dust
into the infrared. For studying the more luminous, (and therefore more dusty)
galaxies, infrared spectroscopy is crucial even at moderate redshifts. For the
less dusty galaxies, we are still driven strongly to longer wavelengths as
their redshifts increase from 5 to 10. On the observational side, infrared

the effects of cosmological surface brightness (SB) dimming on these

them to redshift z=5. We find that, comparing all galaxies at the same
intrinsic surface brightness sensitivity, the UV luminosity density contributed

The galaxies have been assigned to three different environments depending on
the local overdensity: clusters, groups, and field, having used our
completeredshift database to guide the assignment of galaxies. It is found that
cluster, group and field early-type galaxies follow almost identical \mg2--\so\
relations, with the largest \mg2 zero-point difference (clusters minus field)
being only $0.007\pm 0.002$ mag. No correlation of the residuals is found with
the morphological type or the bulge to disk ratio. Using stellar population
models in a differential fashion, this small zero-point difference implies a
luminosity-weighted age difference of only $\sim 1$ Gyr between the
corresponding stellar populations, with field galaxies being younger. The
mass-weighted age difference could be significantly smaller, if minor events of
late star formation took place preferentially in field galaxies. We combine
these results with the existing evidence for the bulk of stars in cluster

present model geometric albedo and phase integral spectra and Bond albedos for

Rayleigh scattering predominates in the blue while molecular absorption removes
most red and infrared photons. Thus cloud-free atmospheres, found on giant
planets with effective temperatures exceeding about 400 K, are quite dark in
reflected light beyond 0.6 microns. In cooler atmospheres first water clouds
and then other condensates provide a bright reflecting layer. Only planets with
cloudy atmospheres will be detectable in reflected light beyond 1 micron.
Thermal emission dominates the near-infrared for warm objects with clear
atmospheres. However the presence of other condensates, not considered here,
may brighten some planets in reflected near-infrared light and darken them in
the blue and UV. Bond albedos, the ratio of the total reflected to incident
power, are sensitive to the spectral type of the primary. Most incident photons
from early type stars will be Rayleigh scattered, while most incident photons
from late type stars will be absorbed. The Bond albedo of a given planet thus
may range from 0.4 to 0.05, depending on the primary type. Condensation of a
water cloud increases the Bond albedo of a given planet by up to a factor of
two. The spectra of cloudy planets are strongly influenced by poorly
constrained cloud microphysical properties, particularly particle size and
supersaturation. Both Bond and geometric albedos are comparatively less
sensitive to variations in planet mass and effective temperature.

The
uncertainty in the gamma-ray beaming angle, theta, leaves the total energy
release (proportional to theta^2) and the event rate per galaxy (proportional
to 1/theta^2) unknown to within orders of magnitude. Since the delayed radio
emission of GRB sources originates from a mildly relativistic shock and
receives only weak relativistic beaming, the rate of radio-selected transients
with no GRB counterpart can be used to set an upper limit on 1/theta^2. We find
that a VLA survey with a sensitivity of 0.1 mJy at 10 GHz could identify more
than 2e4/(theta/10degrees)^2 radio afterglows across the sky if each source is
sampled at least twice over a period of one month or longer. From the total
number of >0.1 mJy sources observed at 8.44 GHz and the fraction of fading
sources at 1.44 GHz, we get the crude limit, theta>6 degrees.

BeppoSAX in consecutive days during 1997 April and May. The source was in a
quiescent state, with an average 2-10 keV flux of 9.0 x 10^(-11) erg/cm/cm/s.
Flux variation by a factor of ~2 on timescales as short as a few 10 ks were
more pronounced in the hard (i.e. above ~3 keV) than in the soft X-rays. The
broadband (0.1-40 keV) spectrum is concave and can be most easily explained
with a power-law model which steepens gradually with energy. In this framework,
neither photoabsorption edges nor resonant absorption lines are required,
strengthening the case against the ubiquity of such features in BL Lac objects,
which had been previously suggested by Einstein observations. The broadband
spectrum hardens with hard X-ray flux, mostly due to a flattening above ~4 keV.
This suggests that the relativistic highest energy electron distribution
properties drive the X-ray spectral dynamics: either a stratification of the
distribution in the jet with energy or inhomogeneities in the electron
injection mechanism could be consistent with the observed variability pattern.

The generalised RPA is used to compute single-particle properties such as

confinement influences the interfacial structure in two ways: It squeezes the
intrinsic structure and cuts off the capillary wave spectrum. As a result, the
interfacial width is proportional to the film thickness D in very thin films,
and proportional to the square root of D in thicker films. These effects are
then discussed in detail for the special case of an interface between demixed
homopolymer phases. The width of the intrinsic profile is calculated
analytically as a function of film thickness in the Cahn-Hilliard approximation

driven by the change of the spin-1/2 excitation character from the itinerant

this purpose we examine the possibility of the existence of non-causal signals

In such model the signal propagates along invariant intervals. It is shown that
there are no non-causal signals in the considered model. The recent statement

-- an improved implementation of the strategies that were recently proposed by
Neubert and Rosner to probe the CKM angle $\gamma$ with the help of
$B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ decays. In particular, it allows us to
investigate the sensitivity of the extracted value of $\gamma$ to the basic
assumptions of their approach. We find that certain SU(3)-breaking effects may
have an important impact and emphasize that additional hadronic uncertainties
are due to rescattering processes. The latter can be controlled by using SU(3)
flavour symmetry arguments and additional experimental information provided by
$B^\pm\to K^\pm K$ modes. We propose a new strategy to probe the angle $\gamma$
with the help of the neutral decays $B_d\to\pi^0 K, \pi^\mp K^\pm$, which is
theoretically cleaner than the $B^\pm\to\pi^\pm K, \pi^0K^\pm$ approach. Here
rescattering processes can be taken into account by just measuring the
CP-violating observables of the decay $B_d\to\pi^0K_{\rm S}$. Finally, we point
out that an experimental analysis of $B_s\to K^+K^-$ modes would also be very
useful to probe the CKM angle $\gamma$, as well as electroweak penguins, and we
critically compare the virtues and weaknesses of the various approaches
discussed in this paper. As a by-product, we point out a strategy to include
the electroweak penguins in the determination of the CKM angle $\alpha$ from

an attraction of about -100 MeV at normal nuclear density. The Lambda(1405)

emission is detected, the entangled state is created. We have developed a model
to analyze the fidelity of the resulting state as a function of the dimensions
and location of the detector, and the motional properties of the atoms.

nonlinear quantum wells. In this paper we examine the sinusoidally driven
particle in a square potential well to show that avoided crossings can alter
the structure of Floquet states in this system. Two types of avoided crossings
are identified: on type leads only to temporary changes (as a function of
driving field strength) in Floquet state structure while the second type can
lead to permanent delocalization of the Floquet states. Radiation spectra from
these latter states show significant increase in high harmonic generation as
the system passes through the avoided crossing.

  to quantum measurement theory, entanglement and non-locality, a simple
  introduction to stochastic calculus, and a detailed introduction to the
  input-output formulation of noise in optical cavities",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In this thesis we consider primarily the dynamics of quantum systems
subjected to continuous observation. In the Schr\""{o}dinger picture the
evolution of a continuously monitored quantum system, referred to as a `quantum
trajectory', may be described by a stochastic equation for the state vector. We
present a method of deriving explicit evolution operators for linear quantum
trajectories, and apply this to a number of physical examples of varying
mathematical complexity.
  In the Heisenberg picture evolution resulting from continuous observation may
be described by quantum Langevin equations. We use this method to examine the
noise spectrum that results from a continuous observation of the position of a
moving mirror, and examine the possibility of detecting the noise resulting
from the quantum back-action of the measurement.
  In addition to the work on continuous measurement theory, we also consider
the problem of reconstructing the state of a quantum system from a set of
measurements. We present a scheme for determining the state of a single cavity
mode from the photon statistics measured both before and after an interaction
with one or two two-level atoms.

be altered just before the arrival of particle, and this ``delayed choice''
can, seemingly, alter the quantum state of the particle at a much earlier time,
long before the choice is made.
  A slightly different gedanken experiment, which exhibits the same conceptual
difficulty, is analyzed using the techniques of consistent history quantum
theory. The idea that the future influences the past disappears when proper
account is taken of the diversity of possible quantum descriptions of the
world, and their mutual compatibility or incompatibility.

machine into the quantum framework. Implementations based on this paradigm have
limitations as to the number of: qubits, computation steps, efficient quantum
algorithms (found so far). A new exclusively quantum paradigm (with no
classical counterpart) is propounded, based on the speculative notion of
continuous uncomplete von Neumann measurement. Under such a notion, NP-complete
is equal to P. This can provide a mathematical framework for the search of
implementable paradigms, possibly exploiting particle statistics.
