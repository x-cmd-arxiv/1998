a barred galaxy which contains a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) rapidly
evolves into a nuclear gas ring by the effect of an additional inner Lindblad
resonance caused by the SMBH. In this paper, we investigate the fate of the gas
ring, involving self-gravity of gas, using two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations. We find that the gas ring becomes gravitationally unstable for a
gas surface density of gas above a critical value, and fragments into several
gas clumps. Some denser clumps increase their mass via the accretion of the
surrounding gas and collisions with other clumps, and finally a very massive
gas clump (10^7 M_sun) is formed. Due to the torque from the most massive
clump, a part of the gas in the ring loses its angular momentum and falls into
the galactic center. As a result, a nuclear gas disk (50 pc) is formed around
the SMBH. The accretion rate for $R<50$ pc attains about 1 M_sun/yr for
3.5*10^7 yr. At the final phase of the bar-driven fueling, self-gravity is
crucial for the angular momentum transfer of the gas. This is a new mechanism
for gas fueling to the vicinity of the SMBH.

$AdS_5 \times S^5$ is mapped into itself by a duality transformaion, thereby
verifying the $SL(2,Z)$ invariance of the D3-brane action in the $AdS_5 \times
S^5$ background as in the flat background. To this end, we fix the
$\kappa$-symmetry in a gauge which simplifies the classical action in order to
perform an SO(2) rotation of the N=2 spinor index in a manifest way, though
this may not be necessary. This situation is the same as the case of a super
D-string on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ where it was shown that the super D-string
action is transformed to a form of the IIB Green-Schwarz superstring action
with the $SL(2,Z)$ covariant tension in the $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background
through a duality transformation. These results strongly suggest that various
duality relations originally found in the flat background may be independent of
background geometry, in other words, the duality transformations in string and
p-brane theories may exist even in general curved space-time.

  Whittaker kernel","AMSTeX, 17 pages",,,,"math.RT cond-mat gr-qc hep-th math.PR nlin.SI solv-int",,"  We study a 2-parametric family of probability measures on the space of
countable point configurations on the punctured real line (the points of the
random configuration are concentrated near zero). These measures (or,
equivalently, point processes) have been introduced in Part II (A. Borodin,
math.RT/9804087) in connection with the problem of harmonic analysis on the
infinite symmetric group. The main result of the present paper is a
determinantal formula for the correlation functions.
  The formula involves a kernel called the matrix Whittaker kernel. Each of its
two diagonal blocks governs the projection of the process on one of the two
half-lines; the corresponding kernel on the half-line was studied in Part III
(A. Borodin and G. Olshanski, math/RT/9804088).
  While the diagonal blocks of the matrix Whitaker kernel are symmetric, the
whole kernel turns out to be $J$-symmetric, i.e., symmetric with respect to a
natural indefinite inner product.
  We also discuss a rather surprising connection of our processes with the
recent work by B. Eynard and M. L. Mehta (cond-mat/9710230) on correlations of
eigenvalues of coupled random matrices.

  Our work originated from harmonic analysis on the infinite symmetric group.
The problem of spectral decomposition for certain representations of this group
leads to a family of probability measures on an infinite-dimensional simplex,
which is a kind of dual object for the infinite symmetric group. To understand
the nature of these measures we interpret them as stochastic point processes on
the punctured real line and compute their correlation functions. The
correlation functions are given by multidimensional integrals which can be
expressed in terms of a multivariate hypergeometric series (the Lauricella
function of type B). It turns out that after a slight modification (`lifting')
of the processes the correlation functions take a common in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) determinantal form with a certain kernel.
  The kernel is expressed through the classical Whittaker functions. It depends
on two parameters and admits a variety of degenerations. They include the
well-known in RMT sine and Bessel kernels as well as some other Bessel-type
kernels which, to our best knowledge, are new.
  The explicit knowledge of the correlation functions enables us to derive a
number of conclusions about the initial probability measures.
  We also study the structure of our kernel; this finally leads to a
constructive description of the initial measures.
  We believe that this work provides a new promising connection between RMT and
Representation Theory.

case of ideal experiments, this inequality is equivalent to Bell's original
inequality of 1965 which, as is well known, is violated by a maximum factor of
1.5. The crucial point is that even in the case of real experiments where
polarizers and detectors are non-ideal, the present inequality is violated by a
factor of 1.5, whereas previous inequalities such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality of 1969 and Clauser-Horne inequality of 1974 are violated by a
factor of $\sqrt 2$. The larger magnitude of violation can be of importance for
the experimental test of locality. Moreover, the supplementary assumption used
to derive this inequality is weaker than Garuccio-Rapisarda assumption. Thus an
experiment based on this inequality refutes a larger family of hidden variable
theories than an experiment based on Garuccio-Rapisarda inequality.
