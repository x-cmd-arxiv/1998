emission from a highly relativistic blast wave, which is inferred from the
gamma-ray flux detected in GRB 980425 and from the very bright radio emission
detected in SN 1998bw. We find that the observed gamma-ray and radio light
curves are roughly reproduced by the synchrotron emission from a relativistic
fireball. The optical flux predicted for the non-thermal emission is well below
that of the thermal emission observed for SN 1998bw so that it will not be seen
at least for a few years. The model predicts the X-ray flux just above the
detection limit of BeppoSAX for the epoch when it was pointed to the field of
GRB980425. Therefore, the nondetection of X-ray and optical afterglows is
consistent with the model. The models presented here are consistent with the
physical association between SN 1998bw and GRB980425, and lend further support
to the idea that this object might correspond to an event similar to the
``hypernova'' or ``collapsar'' -- events in which the collapse of a massive
star forms a rotating black hole surrounded by a disk of the remnant stellar

edge-on, starburst galaxy NGC 2146. These X-ray spectral data complement ROSAT
PSPC and HRI imaging discussed by Armus et al., 1995. The broad band (0.6-9
keV) X-ray spectrum of NGC 2146 is best described by a two component model: the
soft X-ray emission with a Raymond-Smith thermal plasma model having a
temperature of kT $\sim 0.8$ keV; the hard X-ray emission with a thermal plasma
model having kT $\sim 8$ keV or a power-law model having a photon index of
$\sim 1.7$. We do not find compelling evidence of substantial excess absorption
above the Galactic value. The soft (hard) thermal component provides about 30%
(70%) of the total luminosity in the 0.5 - 2.0 keV energy band, while in the
2-10 keV energy range only the hard component plays a major role. The spectral
results allow us to set tighter constraints on the starburst-driven superwind
model, which we show can satisfactorily account for the luminosity, mass, and
energy content represented by the soft X-ray spectral component. We estimate
that the mass outflow rate ($\sim$ 9 M$_{\odot}$ per year) is about an order of
magnitude greater than the predicted rate at which supernovae and stellar winds
return mass into the interstellar medium and, therefore, argue that the flow is
strongly ""mass-loaded"" with material in and around the starburst. The estimated
outflow velocity of the hot gas is close to the escape velocity from the
galaxy, so the fate of the gas is not clear. We suggest that the hard X-ray
spectral component is due to the combined emission of X-ray binaries and/or
young supernovae remnants associated with the starburst.

of a barred spiral galaxy, with the bar lying in a plane that is tilted ~18

the inner regions of CenA is noticeably displaced from the more chaotic and
widespread optical obscuration. The barred spiral is a quasi-stable structure
formed at the center of the giant elliptical from the tidal debris of a

by means of a chemical evolution model which reproduces most of the
observational constraints in the solar vicinity and in the disk. We have
restricted our analysis to the solar neighborhood and present the predicted
abundances of several elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe) over an extended
range of metallicities $[Fe/H] = -4.0$ to $[Fe/H] = 0.0$ compared to previous
models. We adopted the most recent yield calculations for massive stars taken
from different authors (Woosley & Weaver 1995 and Thielemann et al. 1996) and
compared the results with a very large sample of data, one of the largest ever
used to this purpose. These data have been analysed with a new and powerful
statistical method which allows us to quantify the observational spread in
measured elemental abundances and obtain a more meaningful comparison with the
predictions from our chemical evolution model. Our analysis shows that the
``plateau'' observed for the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios at low metallicities ($-3.0<
[Fe/H] <-1.0$) is not perfectly constant but it shows a slope, especially for
oxygen. This slope is very well reproduced by our model with both sets of
yields. This is not surprising since realistic chemical evolution models,
taking into account in detail stellar lifetimes, never predicted a completely
flat plateau. This is due either to the fact that massive stars of different
mass produce a slightly different O/Fe ratio or to the often forgotten fact
that supernovae of type Ia, originating from white dwarfs, start appearing
already at a galactic age of 30 million years and reach their maximum at 1 Gyr.

This letter reports on an analysis of the contents of 26 of the smallest

combines the explicit advection of radiation variables with the implicit

of counterrotating components with an intervening shear layer(s).
Configurations of this type can arise from the accretion of newly supplied
counterrotating matter onto an existing corotating disk. The grid-dependent
numerical viscosity of our hydro code is used to simulate the influence of a
turbulent viscosity of the disk. Firstly, we consider the case where the gas
well above the disk midplane rotates with angular rate +\Omega(r) and that well
below has the same properties but rotates with rate -\Omega(r). We find that
there is angular momentum annihilation in a narrow equatorial boundary layer in
which matter accretes supersonically with a velocity which approaches the
free-fall velocity and the average accretion speed of the disk can be
enormously larger than that for a conventional \alpha-disk rotating in one
direction. Secondly, we consider the case of a corotating accretion disk for
r<r_t and a counterrotating disk for r>r_t. In this case we observed, that
matter from the annihilation layer lost its stability and propagated inward
pushing matter of inner regions of the disk to accrete. Thirdly, we
investigated the case where counterrotating matter inflowing from large radial
distances encounters an existing corotating disk. Friction between the
inflowing matter and the existing disk is found to lead to fast boundary layer
accretion along the disk surfaces and to enhanced accretion in the main disk.
These models are pertinent to the formation of counterrotating disks in
galaxies and possibly in Active Galactic Nuclei and in X-ray pulsars in binary
systems.

neighboring emission by expanses where no emission is seen to the detection
limit of the available data. Candidates for inclusion in this class were
extracted from the Leiden/Dwingeloo HI survey of Hartmann & Burton and from the
Wakker & van Woerden catalogue of high-velocity clouds. The candidates were
subject to independent confirmation using either the 25-meter telescope in
Dwingeloo or the 140-foot telescope in Green Bank. We argue that the resulting
list, even if incomplete, is sufficiently representative of the ensemble of
compact, isolated HVCs - CHVCs - that the characteristics of their disposition

the class. The CHVCs are in fact distributed quite uniformly across the sky. A

of the ensemble returns the Local Group Standard of Rest with high confidence.
The CHVCs are not stationary with respect to this reference frame but have a
mean infall velocity of 100 km/s. These properties are strongly suggestive of a
population which has as yet had little interaction with the more massive Local

impurities. At the insulating side the electrons are all bound in pairs to the
ions. On the metallic side free electrons exist which are scattered by ions
dressed with electron-pairs and therefore alter the bare scattering potential
of the ions. The physics at the metallic side of the transition is argued to be
controlled by the classical to quantum transport cross-over leading to the
observed non-monotonous dependence of the resistivity on temperature. This few
electrons per ion scenario appears to be an experimentally realistic and
testable scenario, which can also serve as a starting point for further
theoretical analysis of the two-dimensional metal-insulator transition.

the magnetic moment and henceforth a spin glass (SG) phase by studying a
fermionic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with a local BCS coupling between the
fermions. This model is obtained by using perturbation theory to trace out the
conduction electrons degrees of freedom in conventional superconducting alloys.
The model is formulated in the path integral formalism where the spin operators
are represented by bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields and it reduces to
a single site problem that can be solved within the static approximation with a
replica symmetric Ansatz. We argue that this is a valid procedure for values of
temperature above the de Almeida-Thouless instability line. The phase diagram
in the T-g plane, where g is the strength of the pairing interaction, for fixed
variance J^2/N of the random couplings J_{ij}, exhibits three regions: a normal
paramagnetic (NP) phase, a spin glass (SG) phase and a pairing (PAIR) phase
where there is formation of local pairs.The NP and PAIR phases are separated by
a second order transition line g=g_{c}(T) that ends at a tricritical point
T_{3}=0.9807J, g_{3}=5,8843J, from where it becomes a first order transition
line that meets the line of second order transitions at T_{c}=0.9570J that
separates the NP and the SG phases. For T<T_{c} the SG phase is separated from
the PAIR phase by a line of first order transitions.
  These results agree qualitatively with experimental data in

  ``Physics Meets Philosophy at the Planck Scale'' (Cambridge University
  Press). Two footnotes added",,"10.1017/CBO9780511612909.015",,"gr-qc quant-ph",,"  After providing an extensive overview of the conceptual elements -- such as
Einstein's `hole argument' -- that underpin Penrose's proposal for
gravitationally induced quantum state reduction, the proposal is constructively
criticised. Penrose has suggested a mechanism for objective reduction of
quantum states with postulated collapse time T = h/E, where E is an
ill-definedness in the gravitational self-energy stemming from the profound
conflict between the principles of superposition and general covariance. Here
it is argued that, even if Penrose's overall conceptual scheme for the
breakdown of quantum mechanics is unreservedly accepted, his formula for the
collapse time of superpositions reduces to T --> oo (E --> 0) in the strictly
Newtonian regime, which is the domain of his proposed experiment to corroborate
the effect. A suggestion is made to rectify this situation. In particular,
recognising the cogency of Penrose's reasoning in the domain of full `quantum
gravity', it is demonstrated that an appropriate experiment which could in
principle corroborate his argued `macroscopic' breakdown of superpositions is
not the one involving non-rotating mass distributions as he has suggested, but
a Leggett-type SQUID or BEC experiment involving superposed mass distributions
in relative rotation. The demonstration thereby brings out one of the
distinctive characteristics of Penrose's scheme, rendering it empirically
distinguishable from other state reduction theories involving gravity. As an
aside, a new geometrical measure of gravity-induced deviation from quantum
mechanics in the manner of Penrose is proposed, but now for the canonical
commutation relations [Q, P] = ih.

the propagation of light in a constant homogeneous magnetic field and in a
Casimir vacuum. The latter appears to be particularly interesting because the
Casimir vacuum has been found to exhibit modes of the propagation of light with

\bar{\nu}_e + D -> e^+ + n + n. Our theoretical value of the astrophysical
factor S_{pp}(0) = 4.02 x 10^{-25} MeV b agrees with the classical result
obtained by Bahcall and Kamionkowski S_{pp}(0) = 3.89 x 10^{-25} MeV b in the
potential model approach (PMA). The cross sections for the disintegration of
the deuteron by photons and anti-neutrinos calculated near thresholds are in
good agreement with the PMA. An extrapolation of the cross sections for
energies far from thresholds is suggested and related to the inclusion of form
factors describing spatial smearing of the deuteron and the NN system. The
extrapolated cross section for the disintegration of the deuteron by
anti-neutrinos agrees with that calculated in the PMA in the anti-neutrino
energy region from threshold up to 10 MeV. The extrapolated cross section
averaged over the reactor anti-neutrino energy spectrum is obtained in
agreement with the experimental data. It is shown that the RFMD enables to
describe elastic low-energy NN scattering in accordance with low-energy nuclear
phenomenology.

previously used covariant representations in reproducing the nucleon
self-energies on the Hartree-Fock level. To enforce correct Hartree-Fock
results we develop a subtraction scheme which treats the bare nucleon-nucleon
potential exactly in accordance to the different types of meson exchanges. For
the remaining ladder kernel, which contains the higher order correlations, we
employ then two different covariant representations in order to study the
uncertainty inherent in the approach. The nuclear matter bulk properties are
only slightly sensitive on the explicit representation used for the kernel.
However, we obtain new Coester lines for the various Bonn potentials which are
shifted towards the empirical region of saturation. In addition the nuclear
equation-of-state turns out to be significantly softer in the new approach.

  Relaxation in Fluids","55 pages, 6 figures Scheduled to appear in J. Chem. Phys., Jan, 1999",,"10.1063/1.478185",,"physics.chem-ph",,"  Notwithstanding the long and distinguished history of studies of vibrational
energy relaxation, exactly how it is that high frequency vibrations manage to
relax in a liquid remains somewhat of a mystery. Both experimental and
theoretical approaches seem to say that there is a natural frequency range
associated with intermolecular motions in liquids, typically spanning no more
than a few hundred cm^{-1}. Landau-Teller-like theories explain how a solvent
can absorb any vibrational energy within this ""band"", but how is it that
molecules can rid themselves of superfluous vibrational energies significantly
in excess of these values? We develop a theory for such processes based on the
idea that the crucial liquid motions are those that most rapidly modulate the
force on the vibrating coordinate -- and that by far the most important of
these motions are those involving what we have called the mutual nearest
neighbors of the vibrating solute. Specifically, we suggest that whenever there
is a single solvent molecule sufficiently close to the solute that the solvent
and solute are each other's nearest neighbors, then the instantaneous
scattering dynamics of the solute-solvent pair alone suffices to explain the
high frequency relaxation. The many-body features of the liquid only appear in
the guise of a purely equilibrium problem, that of finding the likelihood of
particularly effective solvent arrangements around the solute. These results
are tested numerically on model diatomic solutes dissolved in atomic fluids
(including the experimentally and theoretically interesting case of I_2 in Xe).
The instantaneous pair theory leads to results in quantitative agreement with
those obtained from far more laborious exact molecular dynamics simulations.

the discovery of A New Redshift Interpretation (NRI) of the Hubble relation and
the 2.7K CBR, which showed for the first time that it was possible to explain

claiming the standard cosmology is error free. Their analysis assumes the NRI
represents a static cosmological model of the universe. This is wrong. My MPLA
report clearly states the NRI encompasses an expanding universe wherein
galaxies are undergoing Doppler recession due to vacuum density repulsion.
C&S's confusion on this crucial point leads to serious errors in their
analysis. Next, in claiming the standard cosmology is error free, C&S fail to
respond to the contradictory evidence in my preprint, gr-qc/9806061. There I
first show why the universe is governed by Einstein static-spacetime GR, and
not the Friedmann-Lemaitre expanding spacetime paradigm on which Big Bang
cosmology is critically hinged. Secondly, I note a most embarrassing fact about
