  accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters",,"10.1086/311737",,"astro-ph",,"  Dark-matter halos show a universal density profile with a scaling such that
less massive systems are typically denser. This mass-density relation is well
described by a proportionality between the characteristic density of halos and
the mean cosmic density at halo formation time. It has recently been shown that
this proportionality could be the result of the following simple evolutionary
picture. Halos form in major mergers with essentially the same,
cosmogony-dependent, dimensionless profile, and then grow inside-outside, as a
consequence of accretion. Here we verify the consistency of this picture and
show that it predicts the correct zero point of the mass-density relation.

  Conference ""Evolution of Large Scale Structure: From Recombination to
  Garching""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We discuss cosmological inference from galaxy surveys, the X-Ray Background
(XRB) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We assume a family of Cold
Dark Matter (CDM) models in a spatially flat universe with an initially
scale-invariant spectrum and a cosmological constant. Joint analysis of the CMB
and IRAS resdhift surveys yields as optimal parameters (for fixed Omega_b h^2 =
0.024): Omega_m = 1- \omega_lambda = 0.4, h = 0.53, Q = 17muK, and b_iras= 1.2.
For the above parameters the normalisation and shape of the mass power-spectrum
are sigma_8=0.7 and Gamma=0.15, and the age of the Universe is 16.5 Gyr.
Assuming a standard CDM model, the joint IRAS and XRB analysis gives bias
parameters of b_iras = 1.1 and b_x(z=0) = 2.6. When combining CMB and IRAS with
XRB data we show that standard CDM cannot fit all three data sets. We also use
these data sets to verify the Cosmological Principle and to constrain the
fractal dimension of the universe on large scales.

  galaxies","14 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02232.x",,"astro-ph",,"  In this paper we present results of an analysis of radio-quiet QSO
environments. The aim is to determine the relation between QSOs and galaxies as
a function of redshift. We cross-correlate a sample of ~150 QSOs from optically
and X-ray selected catalogues with faint, bj<23, galaxies. These data allow us
to probe the galaxy clustering environment of QSOs out to z~1.0-1.5. Far from
giving a positive correlation, at z<1.5 the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation
function is marginally negative, with w(theta<120'')=-0.027+-0.020. Colour
information suggests that the anti-correlation is most significant between the
QSOs and the red galaxy population.
  We have constructed models to predict the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation, using
the known form of the galaxy N(z) at bj<23, and assuming a variety of
clustering evolution rates. Cases in which QSOs exist in rich cluster
environments are comfortably ruled out at more than 5sigma and the results are
more consistent with a `normal' galaxy environment for radio-quiet QSOs. If the
small anti-correlation is interpreted as an effect of gravitational lensing,
this conclusion is not altered. In this case, the data are only ~1sigma below
the low clustering amplitude models, while the high amplitude models are still
comfortably rejected. We therefore conclude that these QSOs may not be much
more highly biased than optically selected galaxies.

dynamics framework leads to predictions about statistical long-time and
stationary properties of quantum systems with chaotic classical analogues. Many
long-time quantum properties can be quantitatively understood using only
short-time classical dynamics information; these include wavefunction intensity
distributions, intensity correlations in phase space and correlations between
wavefunctions, and distributions of decay rates and conductance peaks in weakly
open systems. Strong deviations from random matrix theory are predicted and
observed in the presence of short unstable periodic orbits.

CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the H -> Z^0 Z^0 decay mode. To find and
then measure the properties of the Higgs, it is crucial to have the most
precise theoretical prediction both for the signal and the QCD background in
this mode. In this work we calculate the effects of the initial-state multiple
soft-gluon emission on the kinematic distributions of photon and Z^0 pairs
produced in hadron collisions. The Collins-Soper-Sterman formalism is extended
to resum the large logarithmic terms due to soft-gluons. The resummed total
rates, the invariant mass, transverse momentum, and rapidity distributions of
the photon and Z^0 pairs, and the transverse momentum distributions of the
individual vector bosons are presented and compared to the fixed order
predictions in the whole kinematic range, for the LHC energies and for the
upgraded Fermilab Tevatron. Our conclusion is that the resummed predictions
should be used when extracting the Higgs signal at the LHC.

supersymmetry will be needed to protect it. If the inflation hypothesis is

$M\sim \TeV$, however convenient that choice might have been for the next

theory, has proved to be a rich source of understanding for knot invariants. In
this work the theory is used to explore the definition of the expectation value
of a network of Wilson lines - an embedded graph invariant. Using a slight
generalization of the variational method, lowest-order results for invariants
for arbitrary valence graphs are derived; gauge invariant operators are
introduced; and some higher order results are found. The method used here
provides a Vassiliev-type definition of graph invariants which depend on both
the embedding of the graph and the group structure of the gauge theory. It is
found that one need not frame individual vertices. Though, without a global
projection of the graph, there is an ambiguity in the relation of the
decomposition of distinct vertices. It is suggested that framing may be seen as
arising from this ambiguity - as a way of relating frames at distinct vertices.
