of rest-frame 2500 A. It is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nearby giant elliptical
galaxies, and is thought to arise primarily from low-mass evolved stars on the
extreme horizontal branch and beyond. Models suggest that the UV upturn is a
very strong function of age for these old stellar populations, increasing as
the galaxy gets older. In some models the change in UV/optical flux ratio is a
factor of 25 over timescales of less than 3 Gyr. To test the predictions for
rapid evolution of the UV upturn, we have observed a sample of normal
elliptical galaxies in the z=0.375 cluster Abell 370 with the Faint Object
Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. A combination of two long-pass
filters was used to isolate wavelengths shortward of rest-frame 2700 A,
providing a measurement of the UV upturn at a lookback time of approximately 4
Gyr. Surprisingly, the four elliptical galaxies observed show a range of UV
upturn strength that is similar to that seen in nearby elliptical galaxies,
with an equivalent 1550-V color ranging from 2.9-3.4 mag. Our result is
inconsistent with some models for the UV upturn; other models are consistent
only for a high redshift of formation (z_f >= 4).

two components, which could be a part of one absorbing structure, or separate

lengths across the deflector. Extinction in the lensing galaxy may thus lead to
a differential obscuration and reddening between the observed macro-lensed QSO
images. These effects naturally depend on the precise shape of the extinction
law and on the redshift of the lens. By means of numerical Monte-Carlo
simulations, using a least-squares fitting method and assuming an extinction
law similar to that observed in the Galaxy, we show how accurate photometric
observations of multiply imaged quasars obtained in several spectral bands
could lead to the estimate of the lens redshift, irrespective of the visibility
of the deflector. Observational requirements necessary to apply this method to
real cases are thoroughly discussed. If extinction laws turn out to be too
different from galaxy to galaxy, we find out that more promising observations
should consist in getting high signal-to-noise low resolution spectra of at
least three distinct images of a lensed quasar, over a spectral range as wide
as possible, from which it should be straightforward to extract the precise
shape of the redshifted extinction law. Very high signal-to-noise, low spectral

the $I$ band observations taken about 0.8 days after outburst are discounted;
the flux density ratio between the $I$ and the $R$ of a factor $\sim 7$ is too
great to be explained by extinction, given the relatively blue $K-I$ color.
Here it is shown that the {\it entire} observed optical/infrared spectrum is
consistent with that which is expected from an unextincted OT at $z \sim 5$. At
this redshift, the light in the observer's $R$ band is strongly suppressed by
absorption in the Ly$\alpha$ forest -- an effect which has been clearly seen in
galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. In spite of its potentially high redshift,
GRB~980329 was an unusually bright burst. If GRB 980329 was indeed at $z \sim

assumptions, the model has virtually no free parameters and can explain all

explains the jet velocity and the radio time delay. The jet powers we derive

accretion disk luminosities, providing further evidence for the existence of
symbiotic jet/disk systems and a common engine mechanism also in low-luminosity

dominated accretion flow evaporates the top layers from the underlying disk by
thermal conduction. The evaporation rate is calculated as a function of the
density of the advective flow, and an analysis is made of the time scales and
length scales of the dynamics of the advective flow. It is shown that
evaporation can only completely destroy the disk if the conductive length scale
is of the order of the radius. This implies that radial conduction is an
essential factor in the evaporation process. The heat required for evaporation

  submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/306991",,"astro-ph",,"  We show that the spectral shape of the low energy tails found for the
time-integrated spectra of gamma-ray bursts, even in the absence of strong
synchrotron cooling, can be significantly softer than the $\nu F_\nu \propto
\nu^{4/3}$ asymptote predicted by synchrotron shock models. As we have noted in
a previous work, blast wave deceleration via interaction with ambient material
causes the characteristic electron injection energy to decrease in proportion
to the bulk Lorentz factor of the blast wave, and under certain conditions,
this effect will at least partially account for the observed increase in pulse
widths with decreasing energy. This spectral softening can also be reflected in
the time-integrated pulse spectrum. Using a simple model for the blast wave
interaction with a dense cloud of material, we show that just below the $\nu
F_\nu$ spectral peak the integrated spectrum behaves as $\nu F_\nu \sim
\nu^{1/2}$ and rolls over to a $\nu^{4/3}$ dependence at lower energies, thus a
spectral shape arises which is similar to that predicted for the spectrum of a
strongly synchrotron-cooled electron population. We discuss the implications of
this work in the context of models of burst light curve variability which are
based on blast wave/cloud interactions.

characterized by a parameter called $\epsilon$. It is demonstrated, using
numerical simulations of up to 25 copies and 28 shells that in the $N\to

functions whose scaling exponents are anomalous. The theoretical calculation of
the scaling exponents follows verbatim the closure procedure suggested recently

expected non-relativistic result. We also demonstrate numerically that in
realistic meson models this deviation is always small. We further find that the
angular momentum and energy are the same as for the straight string, but that
the curved string has a small radial momentum not present in a straight string.

process, a non-perturbative gauge invariant continuum Wilsonian effective
action is precisely defined. The formulation makes sense without gauge fixing
and thus manifest gauge invariance may be preserved at all stages. In the large
N limit (of SU(N) gauge theory) the effective action simplifies: it may be
expressed through a path integral for a single particle whose trajectory
describes a Wilson loop. Regularization is achieved with the help of a set of
Pauli-Villars fields whose formulation follows naturally in this picture.
Finally, we show how the one loop beta function was computed, for the first

suggested. We construct the complete unitary theory and show that it
consistently describes the edge excitations of the Haldane-Rezayi state.
Actually, we show that the unitary (c=1) and non-unitary (c=-2) theories are
related by a local map between the two sets of fields and by a suitable change
of conjugation. The unitary theory of the Haldane-Rezayi state is found to be
the same as that of the 331 paired Hall state. Furthermore, the analysis of
modular invariant partition functions shows that no alternative unitary
descriptions are possible for the Haldane-Rezayi state within the class of
rational conformal field theories with abelian current algebra. Finally, the
known c=3/2 conformal theory of the Pfaffian state is also obtained from the
331 theory by a reduction of degrees of freedom which can be physically
realized in the double-layer Hall systems.

the collision, but that the sensitivity is significantly moderated by
interactions that change the effective numbers of pions and kaons during the

electro-positive gas with those of an electro-negative gas, the input voltage
was decreased from 1000 Volts to 350 Volts. The simulation results indicate
that the introduction of negative ions induces dramatic effects on the spatial
and temporal variation of the electric field and on the behavior of the
electron, ion, and displacement currents. In particular, the numerical modeling
predicts the formation of double-layer at the plasma-sheath boundary of
electro-negative discharge.

one-dimensional quantum-mechanical system consisting of a particle in a
single-well potential. We do this by applying the method of steepest descent to
the path-integral representation of the partition function, and we present a
systematic procedure to generate the terms of the series using the minima of
the Euclidean action as the only input. For the particular case of a quartic
anharmonic oscillator, we compute the first two terms of the series, and
investigate their high and low temperature limits. We also exhibit the
nonperturbative character of the terms, as each corresponds to sums over
infinite subsets of perturbative graphs. We illustrate the power of such
resummations by extracting from the first term an accurate nonperturbative
estimate of the ground-state energy of the system and a curve for the specific
heat. We conclude by pointing out possible extensions of our results which
include field theories with spherically symmetric classical solutions.

at ultra-low temperatures. In the presence of a dc electric field the
interatomic potential is changed due to the effective dipole-dipole interaction
between the polarized atoms. Detailed multi-channel scattering calculations
reveal features never before discussed for ultra-cold atomic collisions. We
demonstrate that optimal control of the effective atom-atom interactions can be
achieved under reasonable laboratory conditions. Implications of this research
on the physics of atomic Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and on the pursuit
for atomic degenerate fermion gases will be discussed.
