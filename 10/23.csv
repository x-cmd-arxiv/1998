between different models proposed for the electron density fluctuation spectrum
in the ISM. Data from our long-term scintillation study of 18 pulsars in the DM
range 3-35 pc cm^{-3} (Paper I) are used to investigate two important
observable effects of refractive scintillation: (i) modulations of DISS
observables and flux, and (ii) drifting bands. Our data provide simultaneous
measurements of decorrelation bandwidth, scintillation time scale, flux density
and drift slope of patterns. The observed modulations of the first 3 are
compared with the theoretical predictions, and constraints are placed on the
density spectral form. The measured modulation indices are larger than
predicted by a Kolmogorov form. Measurements of drift slopes and DISS
parameters are used to independently estimate the slope of the density
spectrum, which is found to be consistent with a Kolmogorov form for several
pulsars.The contradictory results from these 2 independent methods are not
reconcilable with the simple theoretical models. Our observations show
anomalous behaviour like persistent drifting bands for some pulsars.This can be
interpreted as an excess power in the low wavenumber range (~10^{-12} -
10^{-13} m^{-1}) compared to the Kolmogorov expectations or the existence of
localized density structures.The results from our observations and those from
the earlier studies are examined for understanding the overall nature of the
density spectrum.The emerging picture is a Kolmogorov-like form in the
wavenumber range ~10^{-6} m^{-1} to ~10^{-11} m^{-1}, which either steepens or
has a bump near ~ 10^{-12} - 10^{-13} m^{-1}. We also discuss possible
implications of our results for the current theoretical models.

measured pulse period 0.01611548182 ms (+- 0.02 ns), Epoch MJD 50540.5, gives a
revised linear spin-down rate of $5.1271 \times 10^{-14} s s^{-1}$, slightly
greater than the previously derived value. The narrow pulse shape (FWHM = 10%
duty cycle) in the ROSAT band resembles those seen in both XTE and ASCA data (>

detection enables us to locate the pulsar at R.A., Dec (J2000) =
$5^h37^m47^s.2, -69^\circ 10' 23''$. With its uncertainty $\sim 3''$, this
position coincides with the centroid of a compact X-ray source. But the pulsed
emission accounts for only about 10% of the source luminosity $\sim 2 \times

suggestions: (1) The pulsar is moving at a high velocity ($\sim 10^3 km/s$);
(2) A bow shock, formed around the pulsar, is responsible for most of the X-ray
emission from the source; (3) A collimated outflow from the bow shock region
powers a pulsar wind nebula that accounts for an elongated non-thermal radio
and X-ray feature to the northwest of the pulsar.

behind a variety of phenomena seen at radio wavelengths in pulsars and compact
radio sources. Though there is substantial observational data to support
several consequences of it, the quantitative predictions from theories have not
been thoroughly tested. In this paper, data from our long-term scintillation
study of 18 pulsars are used to test the predictions. The fluctuations of
decorrelation bandwidth ($\nu_d$), scintillation time scale ($\tau_d$) and flux
density (F) are examined for their cross-correlations and compared with the
predictions. The theory predicts a strong correlation between $\nu_d$ and
$\tau_d$, and strong anti-correlations between $\nu_d$ and F, and $\tau_d$ and
F. For 5 pulsars, we see a reasonable agreement. There is considerable
difficulty in reconciling the results for the rest of the pulsars. Our analysis
shows the underlying noise sources can sometimes reduce the correlation, but
cannot cause an absence of correlation. It is also unlikely that the poor flux
correlations arise from a hitherto unrecognized intrinsic flux variations. For
PSR B0834+06, which shows anomalous behaviour of persistent drift slopes,
positive correlation is found between $\tau_d$ and the drift-corrected $\nu_d$.
Many pulsars show an anti-correlation between $\nu_d$ and the drift slope, and
this is in accordance with the simple models of RISS. The detections of
correlated variations of observables and a reasonable agreement between the
predicted and measured correlations for some pulsars confirm RISS as the
primary cause of the observed fluctuations. However, the complexity seen with
the detailed results suggests the necessity of more comprehensive theoretical
treatments for describing refractive fluctuations and their correlations.

cloud-structuring mechanism in the ISM. Results from a numerical model of the
turbulent ISM at large scales suggest that the phase-like appearance of the
medium, the typical values of the densities and magnetic field strengths in the
intercloud medium, as well as Larson's velocity dispersion-size scaling
relation in clouds may be understood as consequences of the interstellar
turbulence. However, the density-size relation appears to only hold for the
densest simulated clouds, there existing a large population of small,
low-density clouds, which, on the other hand, are hardest to observe. We then
discuss several tests and implications of a fully dynamical picture of
interstellar clouds. The results imply that clouds are transient, constantly
being formed, distorted and disrupted by the turbulent velocity field, with a
fraction of these fluctuations undergoing gravitational collapse. Simulated
line profiles and estimated cloud lifetimes are consistent with observational
data. In this scenario, we suggest it is quite unlikely that quasi-hydrostatic
structures on any scale can form, and that the near pressure balance between
clouds and the intercloud medium is an incidental consequence of the density
field driven by the turbulence and in the presence of appropriate cooling,
rather than a driving or confining mechanism.

with HIRES on the 10m W.M. Keck Telescope. Our principal goal is to investigate
the abundance patterns of the damped systems and thereby determine the
underlying physical processes which dominate their chemical evolution. We place
particular emphasis on gauging the relative importance of two complementary
effects often invoked to explain the damped lya abundances: (1) nucleosynthetic
enrichment from Type II supernovae and (2) an ISM-like dust depletion pattern.
  Similar to the principal results of Lu et al. (1996), our observations lend
support both for dust depletion and Type II SN enrichment. Specifically, the
observed overabundance of Zn/Fe and underabundance of Ni/Fe relative to solar
abundances suggest significant dust depletion within the damped lya systems.
Meanwhile, the relative abundances of Al, Si, and Cr vs. Fe are consistent with
both dust depletion and Type II supernova enrichment. Our measurements of Ti/Fe
and the Mn/Fe measurements from Lu et al. (1996), however, cannot be explained
by dust depletion and indicate an underlying Type II SN pattern. Finally, the
observed values of [S/Fe] are inconsistent with the combined effects of dust
depletion and the nucleosynthetic yields expected for Type II supernovae. This
last result emphasizes the need for another physical process to explain the
damped lya abundance patterns.
  We also examine the metallicity of the damped lya systems both with respect
to Zn/H and Fe/H. Our results confirm previous surveys by Pettini and

enhanced significantly if a baryonic disc is embedded in its dark matter halo.
We investigate the effects of a population of such disks on the probability of
detecting strongly lensed images of distant galaxies and quasars. The optical
depth to lensing is always more than doubled. The effects are particularly
significant at magnifications greater than about 50, for which the optical
depth typically increases by a factor greater than 5. If either the fraction of
discs or the typical disc-to-halo mass ratio increases with redshift, then the
optical depth is expected to be increased even further. Obscuration by dust in
the lensing disc is expected to counteract the associated enhanced
magnification bias for surveys in the optical waveband, but not in the radio
and millimetre/submillimetre wavebands. The presence of galactic discs should
hence lead to a significant increase in the number of lensed galaxies and
quasars detected in both radio- and millimetre/submillimetre-selected surveys.
An increase by a factor of about 3 is expected, enhancing the strong case for
millimetre/submillimetre-wave lens surveys using the next generation of
ground-based telescopes and the FIRST and Planck Surveyor space missions.

that the CO feature is being diluted by a contribution from an AGN, thereby
confirming the composite nature of these galaxies.

calculate the abundance evolution for altogether 16 different elements in

towards a more realistic galaxy modeling. Our models well reproduce observed
average HII region abundances in all spiral types. All observed element
abundances in DLA systems have been compiled. The conformity between observed
and calculated abundances over the redshift range from z=4.5 through z=0.4
indicates that DLA galaxies may well evolve into the full range of present- day
spiral galaxies from Sa through Sd.
  Comparison of our chemically consistent models with models using only solar
metallicity input physics shows that differences in the redshift evolution are
small for some elements but large for others. For those elements with large
differences the chemically consistent models provide significant better
agreement with observed DLA abundances.
  For typical spiral galaxies the star formation histories of our models
clearly bridge the gap between high redshift DLA systems and the nearby spiral
galaxy population. The slow redshift evolution of DLA abundances is understood
in terms of the long star formation timescales in galactic and proto-galactic
disks. Towards lower redshift z < 1.5 our models indicate that early type
spirals drop out of the DLA samples as their gas content falls below ~50%.
Implications for optical identification are discussed.

at a constant cooling rate. The cooling rate governs the magnitude of the FC

T_{i}, imprints an extended spin configuration, a process that is reflected
e.g. in a downward relaxation of M_{FC}. On continued cooling at the same rate,
the magnitude of M_{FC}(T) remains at a lower level than that of a continuous

naturally in these theories. Motivated by this fact, we derive a general and

by gauging the global $SU(2)$ group and adding a corresponding Chern-Simons
term, has got its own soliton. These solitons are somewhat distinct from those
of pure $CP^1$ model as they cannot always be characterised by $\pi_2(CP^1)=Z$.
In this paper, we first carry out a detailed Hamiltonian analysis of this
gauged $CP^1$ model. This reveals that the model has only $SU(2)$ as the gauge
invariance, rather than $SU(2) \times U(1)$. The $U(1)$ gauge invariance of the
original (ungauged) $CP^1$ model is actually contained in the $SU(2)$ group
itself. Then we couple the Hopf term associated to these solitons and again
carry out its Hamiltonian analysis. The symplectic structures, along with the
structures of the constraints of these two models (with or without Hopf term)
are found to be essentially the same. The model with a Hopf term is shown to
have fractional spin which, when computed in the radiation gauge, is found to
depend not only on the soliton number $N$, but also on the nonabelian charge.
We then carry out a reduced (partially) phase space analysis in a different
physical sector of the model where the degrees of freedom associated with the
$CP^1$ fields are transformed away. The model now reduces to a $U(1)$ gauge
theory with two Chern-Simons gauge fields getting mass-like terms and one
remaining massless. In this case the fractional spin is computed in terms of
the dynamical degrees of freedom and shown to depend purely on the charge of
the surviving abelian symmetry. Although this reduced model is shown to have
its own solitonic configuration, it turns out to be trivial.

conformal windows where the theory is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet
while the infrared physics is governed by a non-trivial fixed-point. In SQCD,
the lower N_f boundary of the conformal window, below which the theory is
confining is well understood thanks to duality. In QCD there is just a
sufficient condition for confinement based on superconvergence. Studying the
Banks-Zaks expansion and analyzing the conditions for the perturbative coupling
to have a causal analyticity structure, it is shown that the infrared
fixed-point in QCD is perturbative in the entire conformal window. This finding
suggests that there can be no analog of duality in QCD. On the other hand in
SQCD the infrared region is found to be strongly coupled in the lower part of
the conformal window, in agreement with duality. Nevertheless, we show that it
is possible to interpolate between the Banks-Zaks expansions in the electric
and magnetic theories, for quantities that can be calculated perturbatively in
both. This interpolation is explicitly demonstrated for the critical exponent
that controls the rate at which a generic physical quantity approaches the

analogies between Quantum Field Theory (QFT), and Classical as well as Quantum
Statistical Physics. Ideas coming from Statistical Physics have then led to a
deeper understanding of Quantum Field Theory and open the way for a wealth of
non-perturbative methods. Conversely QFT methods are become essential for the
description of the phase transitions and critical phenomena beyond mean field
theory. This is the point we want to illustrate here. We therefore review the
methods, based on renormalized phi^4_3 quantum field theory and renormalization
group, which have led to an accurate determination of critical exponents of the
N-vector model, and more recently of the equation of state of the 3D Ising
model. The starting point is the perturbative expansion for RG functions or the
effective potential to the order presently available. Perturbation theory is
known to be divergent and its divergence has been related to instanton
contributions. This has allowed to characterize the large order behaviour of
perturbation series, an information that can be used to efficiently ""sum"" them.
Practical summation methods based on Borel transformation and conformal mapping
have been developed, leading to the most accurate results available probing
field theory in a non perturbative regime. We illustrate the methods with a
short discussion of the scaling equation of state of the 3D Ising model.
Compared to exponents its determination involves a few additional (non-trivial)
technical steps, like the use of the parametric representation, and the
order-dependent mapping.

external electric field on atomic three-body systems. We first derive the
lowest order effective two-body interaction for two spin zero atoms in the
field. Then we solve the three-body problem and search for the extreme
spatially extended Efimov states. We use helium trimers as an illustrative
numerical example and estimate the necessary field strength to be less than 2.7

  submitted to Physical Review A",,,"IISc-CTS/11/98","quant-ph hep-th",,"  Feynman's path integrals provide a hidden variable description of quantum
mechanics (and quantum field theories). The time evolution kernel is unitary in
Minkowski time, but generically it becomes real and non-negative in Euclidean
time. It follows that the entangled state correlations, that violate Bell's
inequalities in Minkowski time, obey the inequalities in Euclidean time. This
observation emphasises the link between violation of Bell's inequalities in
quantum mechanics and unitarity of the theory. Search for an evolution kernel
that cannot be conveniently made non-negative leads to effective interactions
that violate time reversal invariance. Interactions giving rise to geometric
phases in the effective description of the theory, such as the anomalous
Wess-Zumino interactions, have this feature. I infer that they must be present
in any set-up that produces entangled states violating Bell's inequalities.
Such interactions would be a crucial ingredient in a quantum computer.
