field galaxies in the core of cluster-lenses, using a selection criterium based
on both lens modelling and photometric redshifts. We concentrate on two
multiple-imaged sources at z=4.05 in the cluster A2390. The 2 objects presented
in this paper, namely H3 and H5, were identified through lens modelling as
multiple images of high-redshift sources at z>3.5. We confirm the excellent
agreement between this identification and both their photometric redshifts and
morphologies. Our CFHT/WHT program for a systematic redshift survey of arcs in
clusters has allowed to obtain a set of spectra on 3 different images at z~4:
the brightest image of H3, which redshift was already confirmed by Frye &
Broadhurst (1998), and the two brightest images of H5. The later is then
confirmed spectroscopically as a multiple image, giving a strong support to the
lens model. The main feature in each of these spectra is a strong emission
line, identified as Ly-alpha, leading to z=4.05 for both H3 and H5. The
spectrophotometric properties of these galaxies are studied, in particular the
degeneracy in the parameter-space defined by the SFR type, age, metallicity and
reddening. H3 and H5 are intrinsically bright and clumpy sources located ~100
kpc part on the source plane, with mean metallicities compatible with a
fraction of solar or even solar values. All these results seem to favour a
hierarchical merging scenario, where we are actually seeing a relatively
advanced step for these 2 z~4 objects, with stars forming locally and
efficiently from a preenriched gas.

luminosity functions. The radio-loud optical luminosity function is featureless
and flatter than the radio-quiet one. It evolves at a marginally slower rate if
quasars evolve by density evolution, but the difference in the rate of
evolutions of the two different classes is much less than was previously

to be dominant, however, as these results are sensitive to uncertainties in our

the existence of core radii. Further observational work will be required before

Analyzing such images is difficult on scales close to their resolution limits

astronomical source generally contains more information about its structure
than any single undersampled image, however, and may permit reconstruction of a
``superimage'' with Nyquist sampling. I present a tutorial on a method of image
reconstruction that builds a superimage from a complex linear combination of

works by algebraically eliminating the high order satellites in the periodic
transforms of the aliased images. The reconstructed image is an exact
representation of the data-set with no loss of resolution at the Nyquist scale.
The algorithm is directly derived from the theoretical properties of aliased
images and involves no arbitrary parameters, requiring only that the dithers
are purely translational and constant in pixel-space over the domain of the
object of interest. I show examples of its application to WFC and PC images. I

procedure is to k-correct all pixels belonging to the images of a complete set
of bright galaxies and then to replicate each galaxy image to higher redshift
by the product of its space density, 1/V_{max}, and the cosmological volume.
The set of bright galaxies is itself selected from the HDF, because presently
the HDF provides the highest quality UV images of a redshift-complete sample of
galaxies (31 galaxies with I<21.9, \bar{z}=0.5, and for which V/V_{max} is
spread fairly). These galaxies are bright enough to permit accurate
pixel-by-pixel k-corrections into the restframe UV (\sim 2000 A). We match the
shot noise, spatial sampling and PSF smoothing of the HDF data, resulting in
entirely empirical and parameter-free ``no-evolution'' deep fields of galaxies
for direct comparison with the HDF. In addition, the overcounting rate and the
level of incompleteness can be accurately quantified by this procedure. We
obtain the following results. Faint HDF galaxies (I>24) are much smaller, more
numerous, and less regular than our ``no-evolution'' extrapolation, for any
interesting geometry. A higher proportion of HDF galaxies ``dropout'' in both U

the need for significant evolution in the HDF at faint magnitudes. Here we
incorporate evolution into our procedure, by transforming the input bright
galaxy images with redshift, for comparison with the HDF at faint magnitudes.
Pure luminosity evolution is explored assuming that galaxy surface brightness
evolves uniformly, at a rate chosen to reproduce the I-band counts. This form
of evolution exacerbates the size discrepancy identified by our no-evolution
simulations, by increasing the area of a galaxy visible to a fixed isophote.
Reasonable dwarf-augmented models are unable to generate the count excess
invoking moderate rates of stellar evolution. A plausible fit to the counts and
sizes is provided by `mass-conserving' density-evolution, consistent with
small-scale hierarchical growth, where the product of disk area and space
density is conserved with redshift. Here the increased surface brightness
generated by stellar evolution is accomodated by the reduced average galaxy
size, for a wide range of geometries. These models are useful for assessing the
limitations of the HDF images, by calculating their rates of incompleteness and
the degree of over-counting. Finally we demonstrate the potential for
improvement in quantifying evolution at fainter magnitudes using the HST
Advanced Camera, with its superior UV and optical performance.

such systems, demanding appropriate scaling with respect to the renormalization

renormalization group running in theory space. In such treatments N_f denotes
the number of effective fermionic degrees of freedom above the Fermi surface;
this number is roughly proportional to the size of the Fermi surface. As an
application of these ideas, non-trivial infra red structure in three
dimensional U(1) gauge theory is discussed, along with applications to the
normal phase physics of high-T_c superconductors, in an attempt to explain the
experimentally observed deviations from Fermi liquid behaviour. Specifically,
the direct current resistivity of the theory is computed at finite
temperatures, $T$, and is found to acquire $O(1/N_f)$ corrections to the linear

1997}, and updated for the Saalburg summer school 1998, we review the solutions
of O(N) or U(N) models in the large N limit and as 1/N expansions, in the case
of vector representations. The general idea is that invariant composite fields
have small fluctuations for N large. Therefore the method relies on
constructing effective field theories for these composite fields after
integration over the initial degrees of freedom. We illustrate these ideas by
showing that the large N expansion allows to relate the phib^2^2 theory and the
non-linear sigma-model, models which are renormalizable in different
dimensions. In the same way large N techniques allow to relate the
Gross--Neveu, an example of a theory with four-fermi self-interaction, with a
Yukawa-type theory renormalizable in four dimensions, a topic relevant for four
dimensional field theory. Among other issues for which large N methods are also
useful we will briefly discuss finite size effects and finite temperature field
theory, because they involve a crossover between different dimensions.\par

explain how the large N techniques can be generalized, and discuss some

independent quantum interferences due to combined absorptions and emissions of
