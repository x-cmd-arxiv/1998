out that recent simulations strongly support the idea of a thermal-tidal

underluminous by more than 2 sigma (i.e. >1.16 magnitudes in V). This suggests
a possible downward curvature of the Tully-Fisher relation for some of the
smallest and faintest rotationally supported disk galaxies. This may be a
consequence of the increasing prevalence of dark matter in these systems. We
find the deviation from the Tully-Fisher relation to increase with decreasing

the response of molecular clouds in the Galactic disk to a rotating bar and
their subsequent evolution in the Galactic Center (GC) region. The Galactic
potential in our models is contributed by three axisymmetric components
(massive halo, exponential disk, compact bulge) and a non-axisymmetric bar.
These components are assumed to be invariant in time in the frame corotating
with the bar. Some noticeable features such as an elliptical outer ring, spiral
arms, a gas-depletion region, and a central concentration have been developed
due to the influence of the bar. The rotating bar induces non-circular motions
of the SPH particles, but hydrodynamic collisions tend to suppress the random
components of the velocity. The velocity field of the SPH particles is
consistent with the kinematics of molecular clouds observed in HCN (1-0)
transition; these clouds are thought to be very dense clouds. However, the l-v
diagram of the clouds traced by CO is quite different from that of our SPH
simulation, being more similar to that obtained from simulations using
collisionless particles. The $l-v$ diagram of a mixture of collisional and
collisionless particles gives better reproduction of the kinematic structures
of the GC clouds observed in the CO line. The fact that the kinematics of HCN
clouds can be reproduced by the SPH particles suggests that the dense clouds in
the GC are formed via cloud collisions induced by rotating bar.

literature and recently acquired high-accuracy stellar kinematic data to
constrain the three-dimensional mass distribution in the luminous cuspy
elliptical galaxy NGC 1700. First, we model the radial velocity field and
photometry, and, using a Bayesian technique, estimate the triaxiality T and
short-to-long axis ratio c in five concentric annuli between approximately 1
and 3 effective radii. The results are completely consistent with T being
constant inside about 2.5 r_e (36 arcsec; 6.7/h kpc). Adding an assumption of
constant T as prior information gives an upper limit of T < 0.16 (95%
confidence); this relaxes to T < 0.22 if it is also assumed that there is
perfect alignment between the angular momentum and the galaxy's intrinsic short
axis. Near axisymmetry permits us then to use axisymmetric models to constrain
the radial mass profile. Using the Jeans (moment) equations, we demonstrate
that 2-integral, constant-M/L models cannot fit the data; but a 2-integral
model in which the cumulative enclosed M/L increases by a factor of roughly 2
from the center out to 12/h kpc can. Three-integral models constructed by
quadratic programming show that, in fact, no constant-M/L model is consistent
with the kinematics. Anisotropic 3-integral models with variable M/L, while not
uniquely establishing a minimum acceptable halo mass, imply, as do the moment
models, a cumulative M/L_B approximately 10 h at 12/h kpc. We conclude that NGC
1700 represents the best stellar dynamical evidence to date for dark matter in
elliptical galaxies.

is presented. Different event topologies, corresponding to different neutrino
parent energies can be detected. The upward throughgoing muon sample is the
larger event sample. The observed upward-throughgoing muons are 26% fewer than
expected and the zenith angle distribution does not fit with the expected one.
Assuming neutrino oscillations, both measurements suggest maximum mixing and
Dm2 of a few times 10-3 eV2. The other samples are due to the internally
produced events and to upward-going stopping muons. These data show a regular
deficit of observed events in each angular bin, as expected assuming neutrino
oscillations with maximum mixing, in agreement with the analysis of the
upward-throughgoing muon sample.

these criteria are satisfied in maximal center gauge, and we show here that
they all fail in the absence of gauge fixing. The non-triviality of center

The basic
objects are families of complex-valued amplitudes, which define a meromorphic
conformal field theory (or chiral algebra) and which lead naturally to the
definition of topological vector spaces, between which vertex operators act as
continuous operators. In fact, in order to develop the theory, M\""obius
invariance rather than full conformal invariance is required but it is shown
that every M\""obius theory can be extended to a conformal theory by the
construction of a Virasoro field.
  In this approach, a representation of a conformal field theory is naturally
defined in terms of a family of amplitudes with appropriate analytic
properties. It is shown that these amplitudes can also be derived from a
suitable collection of states in the meromorphic theory. Zhu's algebra then
appears naturally as the algebra of conditions which states defining highest
weight representations must satisfy. The relationship of the representations of
Zhu's algebra to the classification of highest weight representations is
explained.

we study the ``e+ e-'' cross sections into ``hadrons'' for both theories in the

cross sections exactly in the infrared limit. They are indeed equal in the
low-energy limit and the equality is guaranteed because of the anomaly matching
condition. The ultraviolet behavior of the total ``e+ e-'' cross section is
different for the two theories. We comment on proposed non-supersymmetric
dualities. We also analyze the agreement of the ``\gamma\gamma'' and ``WW''
scattering amplitudes in both theories, and in particular try to understand if
their equivalence can be explained by the anomaly matching condition.

the two-frequency Faraday experiment, we investigate the role of normal form
symmetries in the pattern selection problem. With forcing frequency components
in ratio m/n, where m and n are co-prime integers, there is the possibility
that both harmonic and subharmonic waves may lose stability simultaneously,
each with a different wavenumber. We focus on this situation and compare the
case where the harmonic waves have a longer wavelength than the subharmonic
waves with the case where the harmonic waves have a shorter wavelength. We show
that in the former case a normal form transformation can be used to remove all
quadratic terms from the amplitude equations governing the relevant resonant
triad interactions. Thus the role of resonant triads in the pattern selection
problem is greatly diminished in this situation. We verify our general results
within the example of one-dimensional surface wave solutions of the
Zhang-Vinals model of the two-frequency Faraday problem. In one-dimension, a
1:2 spatial resonance takes the place of a resonant triad in our investigation.
We find that when the bifurcating modes are in this spatial resonance, it
dramatically effects the bifurcation to subharmonic waves in the case of
forcing frequencies are in ratio 1/2; this is consistent with the results of
Zhang and Vinals. In sharp contrast, we find that when the forcing frequencies
are in ratio 2/3, the bifurcation to (sub)harmonic waves is insensitive to the
presence of another spatially-resonant bifurcating mode.

we have a micro-irreversible quantum mechanics. The first principle
calculations of the quantum chaos (wave chaos) were pursued on the example of
an elementary chemical reaction Li+(FH)->(LiFH)*->(LiF)+H.

systems: a system known in quantum chemistry as the Hartmann system and a
system of potential use in quantum chemistry and nuclear physics. Both systems
correspond to ring-shaped potentials. They admit two maximally super-integrable
systems as limiting cases, viz, the isotropic harmonic oscillator system and
the Coulomb-Kepler system in three dimensions. The planarity of the
trajectories is studied in a systematic way. In general, the trajectories are
quasi-periodic rather than periodic. A constraint condition allows to pass from
quasi-periodic motions to periodic ones. When written in a quantum mechanical
context, this constraint condition leads to new accidental degeneracies for the
two systems studied.
